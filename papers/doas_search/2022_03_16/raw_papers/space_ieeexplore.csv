10.1109/CODESISSS51650.2020.9244038,A Fast Design Space Exploration Framework for the Deep Learning Accelerators: Work-in-Progress,IEEE,Conferences,"The Capsule Networks (CapsNets) is an advanced form of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), capable of learning spatial relations and being invariant to transformations. CapsNets requires complex matrix operations which current accelerators are not optimized for, concerning both <sub>training</sub> and <sub>inference</sub> passes. Current state-of-the-art simulators and design space exploration (DSE) tools for DNN hardware neglect the modeling of training operations, while requiring long exploration times that slow down the complete design flow. These impediments restrict the real-world applications of CapsNets (e.g., autonomous driving and robotics) as well as the further development of DNNs in life-long learning scenarios that require training on low-power embedded devices. Towards this, we present <sub>XploreDL</sub>, a novel framework to perform fast yet high-fidelity DSE for both inference and training accelerators, supporting both CNNs and CapsNets operations. <sub>XploreDL</sub> enables a resource-efficient DSE for accelerators, focusing on power, area, and latency, highlighting Pareto-optimal solutions which can be a green-lit to expedite the design flow. <sub>XploreDL</sub> can reach the same fidelity as ARM's SCALE-sim, while providing 600x speedup and having a 50x lower memory-footprint. Preliminary results with a deep CapsNet model on MNIST for training accelerators show promising Pareto-optimal architectures with up to 0.4 TOPS/squared-mm and 800 fJ/op efficiency. With inference accelerators for AlexNet the Pareto-optimal solutions reach up to 1.8 TOPS/squared-mm and 200 fJ/op efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9244038/,2020 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS),20-25 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

We can now transfer the communication system from hardware to software, which makes it more flexible and helps us virtualize the communication system. In this paper, we creatively introduce a method to guarantee hard real-time in user-space on Linux. Unlike the usual methods, Our method(real time with RDTSC) provides real-time feature by soft ware clock with RDTSC and isolating CPUs instead of interrupts from the hardware. Our method is highly lightweight and give the SDR systems more flexibility when compared to the usual methods with interrupts.

10.23919/ACC.1990.4791047,A Neural Net Approach to Space Vehicle Guidance,IEEE,Conferences,"The on-line implementation of numerical algorithms for solving the optimum trajectory/guidance problem for advanced space vehicles such as ALS, HLLV, AOTV, transatmospheric vehicles and interplanetary spacecraft is not possible due to their complexity. Hence, the current approach to the development of real-time guidance laws for these advanced space vehicles is to use approximation theory to obtain closed-loop guidance laws. Neural networks offer an alternative to the derivation and implementation of guidance laws. In this paper, we formulate the space vehicle guidance problem using a neural network approach and investigate the appropriate neural net architecture for modelling optimum guidance trajectories. In particular, we investigate the incorporation of a priori knowledge about the characteristics of the optimal guidance solution into the neural network architecture. The online classification performance of the developed network is demonstrated using a synthesized network trained with a data base of optimum guidance trajectories. Such a neural network based guidance approach can readily adapt to environment uncertainties such as those encountered by an AOTV during atmospheric maneuvers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4791047/,1990 American Control Conference,23-25 May 1990,ieeexplore
10.1109/i-PACT52855.2021.9696457,A Novel Deep Recurrent Neural Network for Assessment of Role of Space Charge Effect in Partial Discharge Recognition and Diagnosis,IEEE,Conferences,"Partial Discharge (PD) has evolved into an inevitable tool for diagnosis of insulation of power equipment due to its inherent non-intrusive testing methodology. Since accurate recognition of complex overlapped PD sources is essential for effective diagnosis, recently the focus of research has shifted to challenges related to real-time PD measurement that involve complexities in discriminating multi-source pulse signatures, variations in applied voltage, dynamics of PD patterns related to space charge effect etc. Though research studies have successfully utilized a gamut of machine intelligence techniques such as neural networks, Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines etc, effectiveness of recognition of complex overlapped PD sources based on space charge effect associated with PD has not been comprehensively established. This research focuses on implementation of Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) as a novel strategy for assessing the role of space charge and its associated memory propagation effect in PD signatures. Since Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based DRNN architecture augurs well for data involving sequence similarity recognition, the objective of this research is on establishing an indigenous approach of formulating identification markers to ascertain the role of space charge in PD patterns. The second objective is on establishing a unique approach to decipher state transitions of pulses using transition labels that describes the dynamics of PD signatures due to space charge effect. Detailed case studies based on laboratory benchmark models that replicate complex PD patterns clearly demonstrate the excellent capability of DRNN in deciphering the role of space charge in discriminating complex PD patterns.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9696457/,2021 Innovations in Power and Advanced Computing Technologies (i-PACT),27-29 Nov. 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225245,A depth space approach to human-robot collision avoidance,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper a real-time collision avoidance approach is presented for safe human-robot coexistence. The main contribution is a fast method to evaluate distances between the robot and possibly moving obstacles (including humans), based on the concept of depth space. The distances are used to generate repulsive vectors that are used to control the robot while executing a generic motion task. The repulsive vectors can also take advantage of an estimation of the obstacle velocity. In order to preserve the execution of a Cartesian task with a redundant manipulator, a simple collision avoidance algorithm has been implemented where different reaction behaviors are set up for the end-effector and for other control points along the robot structure.

Nowadays, it becomes reality for the receiver itself acquiring Doppler frequency offset. Frequency acquisition based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been applied extensively. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm of refined estimation after FFT frequency coarse estimation, which is theoretically analyzed to be maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. Its accuracy can achieve 10-4 when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 5dB. By the aid of data, the estimator performs well at low SNR ranges. In the design of carrier acquisition, the accurate estimation of frequency offset aids the phase-locked loop (PLL) into locked state.

10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324376,A multi-layer discriminative framework for parking space detection,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper, we proposed a new multi-layer discriminative framework for vacant parking space detection. From bottom to top, the framework consists of an image feature extraction layer, a patch classification layer, a weighted combination layer, and a status inference layer. In the feature extraction layer, the framework extracts lighting-invariant features to relieve the effects from lighting and shadow. In the patch classification layer, image patches are selected. In order To overcome perspective distortion, each patch was normalized. For different patch, we trained classifiers to recognize the occlusion patterns, which are treated as the middle-level feature of the parking status. In the weighted combination layer, three spaces are grouped as a unit to easily handle inter-object occlusion. Based on the middle-level features, a boosted space classifier was trained to determine the local status of a 3-space unit. In the status inference layer, we regarded these local status decisions as high-level evidences and inferred the final status of the parking lot. The results in an outdoor parking lot show our system can well handle inter-object occlusion and achieve robust vacant space detection under many environmental variations.

10.1109/CCWC47524.2020.9031182,A proposed Crypto-Ransomware Early Detection(CRED) Model using an Integrated Deep Learning and Vector Space Model Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"Crypto-ransomware is a malware category that targets user-related files to encrypt them and hold them to ransom. The irreversible effect of crypto-ransomware attacks entails early detection before it starts encrypting the files. Although several works have been proposed to detect such attacks at the pre-encryption phase before the encryption takes place, the main limitation of these works is the way in which they define the boundaries of the pre-encryption phase. That is, these studies determine the pre-encryption boundaries based on tracking the first call of any cryptography-related Application Programming Interface (API). However, relying on the first call of cryptography-related APIs to delineate the pre-encryption boundaries is not accurate as these APIs might be related to other (normal) tasks done by the crypto-ransomware, such as unpacking and/or decrypting the metamorphic payload, before the ransomware starts the malicious activities. In that case, the collected pre-encryption data lack many relevant pre-encryption attack patterns that come after the mistakenly-identified pre-encryption boundary. Such data insufficiency adversely affects the accuracy of the detection model and increases the rate of false alarms. To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes an early detection model (CRED) that can determine the pre-encryption boundaries and collect the data related to this phase more accurately. Unlike the extant research, the CRED model employs data-centric and process-centric detection approaches to combine both IRP and API data. These data will then be used to train a deep learning-based model. The CRED model will be evaluated using a data-benchmark collected by executing real-world crypto-ransomware samples downloaded from a widely-used repository. The performance of the detection model will be validated using the k-fold cross validation and compared against the models proposed by the existing works.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031182/,2020 10th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),6-8 Jan. 2020,ieeexplore

So, only robot and mission specialists are able to control the robot arm directly in teleoperation mode. By means of an intelligent robot control in cooperation with virtual reality methods, it is possible for non-robot specialists to generate tasks for a robot or an automation component intuitively. Furthermore, the intelligent robot control improves the safety of the entire system. The on-ground robot control and command station for the robot arm ERA onboard the satellite ETS-VII builds on a new resource-based action planning approach to manage robot manipulators and other automation components. In the case of ERA, the action planning system also takes care of the ""real"" robot onboard the satellite and the ""virtual"" robot in the simulation system. By means of the simulation system, the user can plan tasks ahead as well as analyze and visualize different strategies.

The ANN has been tested for training voice signal and for detecting anomaly signal on multiple analog sensors. The build-in radiation hardened UART 115200 interface of standard Space Hardware was utilized to receive compressed data from Artificial Intelligence (AI) Kit. The AI Kit was built to acquire human voice (as voice command) or to process input signals from multiple sensors concurrently. The Kit enables voice intuitively by pressing a training button and selecting proper command type from the keypad. The experiment results show that voice commands were detected successfully with accuracy of more than 95%. The second experiment was carried out by using analog sensor signals mixer to allow AI to learn and determine type of sensor data anomalies when some failures occur. The anomalies types were generated by adding unexpected stimulus signals to AI Kit analog input terminals. The result shows that the anomalies can be detected with accuracy of 80%. The size of AI Kit is relatively small and it was built with commercial components that enable replacement with space radiation hardened components. The space computer platform is based on LEON3 processor core and synthesized on Xilinx Virtex-5QV Field Programmable Logic Arrays (FPGA). The core runs at 100 MHz. The feed forward artificial neural networks Algorithm was implemented on Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS) operating system.

However, the traditional network of the ground cannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among vehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the whole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the transmission delay. The high mobility and low latency in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) put forward higher requirements for security issues such as identity authentication, privacy protection and data security. This paper simplifies the Blockchain and proposes an identity authentication and privacy protection scheme based on the Hashchain in the SAGIN. The scheme focuses on the characteristics of the wireless signal to identify and authenticate the nodes. The verification and backup of the records on the block are implemented with the distributed streaming platform, Kafka algorithm, instead of the consensus.

Thus, the neural networks can be employed to approximate the relation between the hysteretic state and the output of the system that is also the output of hysteresis. The proposed model has a simple architecture that can be easily implemented for on-line adaptation for the model in case of the unexpected change of operating environment.

Such an interpretation has important impacts on several cognitive capabilities and manifestations of intelligence, such as prediction and planning. In this paper, a new framework based on denoising Auto-encoders (dA) is proposed which allows an agent to explore its environment and actively learn the affordances of objects and tools by observing the consequences of acting on them. The dA serves as a unified framework to fuse multi-modal data and retrieve an entire missing modality or a feature within a modality given information about other modalities. This work has two major contributions. First, since training the dA is done in continuous space, there will be no need to discretize the dataset and higher accuracies in inference can be achieved with respect to approaches in which data discretization is required (e.g. Bayesian networks). Second, by fixing the structure of the dA, knowledge can be added incrementally making the architecture particularly useful in online learning scenarios.

Following these simulations, an analysis was presented that shows how memristor programming accuracy and network size are related to output error; the results show that network size can be increased to reduce testing error. In some cases, the memristors in the circuit may be capable of operating with at lower precision if the network size is increased.

For large interframe motions resulting from a limited sensor acquisition rate relative to the speed of the object motion, it suffers from slow convergence and a tendency to be stalled by local minima. A novel method is proposed to improve the performance of ICP-based tracking. The method is based upon the bounded Hough transform (BHT) which estimates the object pose in a coarse discrete pose space. Given an initial pose estimate, and assuming that the interframe motion is bounded in all 6 pose dimensions, the BHT estimates the current frame's pose. On its own, the BHT is able to track an object's pose in sparse range data both efficiently and reliably, albeit with a limited precision. Experiments on both simulated and real data show the BHT to be more efficient than a number of variants of the ICP for a similar degree of reliability. A hybrid method has also been implemented wherein at each frame the BHT is followed by a few ICP iterations. This hybrid method is more efficient than the ICP, and is more reliable than either the BHT or ICP separately.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1443287/,Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05),13-16 June 2005,ieeexplore

In conventional cloud-centric analytics, all the raw data is transferred to a data centre and processed in real-time, near real-time, or in batches. However, this approach is usually not very responsive to real-time analytics due to the latency in transmission alongside network traffic, bandwidth and data transmission costs. To tackle this, edge-enhanced analytics ensures that raw data can be preprocessed at the edge and sent across the network channel in a more compact form. A specific category of deep learning model, autoencoder, can help to achieve this by transforming high-dimensional data into compact representation. We propose an edge-enhanced framework which deploys a deep autoencoder model on the network edge for data compression. After training of models in the cloud, the encoder part of the autoencoder is deployed on the edge for data reduction while the decoder remains on the cloud to reconstruct the data for an image classification task on the cloud. We applied supervised fine-tuning using the intrinsic dimensionality of the data to achieve an accuracy that surpasses the baseline cloud model. The solution was explored in the context of an image recognition problem using the MNIST and FASHION-MNIST datasets. The framework was validated on an event simulator to estimate the network savings of the proposed method in terms of bandwidth and latency. The edge-enhanced approach saves up to 74% bandwidth compared to the centralised analytics.

Motivation and principle of the TSP approach is presented in detail, as well as the implementation. Experiments are conducted on five benchmark corpora using cross-validation to evaluate the proposed TSP approach. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that the TSP approach far outperforms the traditional and most widely used feature construction approach in spam filtering, which is named bag-of-words, in both performance and efficiency. In comparison with the heuristic and state-of-the-art approaches, namely CFC and LC, the proposed TSP approach shows obvious advantage in terms of accuracy and μ<sub>1</sub> measure, as well as high precision, which is warmly welcomed in real spam filtering. Furthermore, the TSP approach performs quite similar with CFC in efficiency of processing incoming emails, while much faster than LC. In addition, it is shown that the TSP approach cooperates well with both unsupervised and supervised feature selection metrics, which endows it with flexible capability in the real world.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6707020/,The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),4-9 Aug. 2013,ieeexplore

The proposed tool provides information about the value of membership functions of the unknown input vector to each class of interest. The designed ARTMAP-like system is called MF-ARTMAP based on the fact that membership functions are calculated. The functions shape is predefined as Gaussian with adaptation of mean value and variance in each feature space dimension during the training procedure. The parallel version of this approach is designed and implemented too. The parallel MF ARTMAP have some advantages over regular MF ARTMAP. The usefulness of this approach is presented on the benchmark classification problems e.g. circle in the square and spiral and on real-world data from satellite images over Slovakia.

For initial ""proof-of-concept"" evaluation we used the game space of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, which was placed in a context of real-time characteristics. Evaluation was done with the XCS algorithm without pre-processing internal knowledge programmed (online mode). Evaluation data results were acquired under real-time constraints. No-loss-strategy was implemented for the game, with various scenarios tested to find out if the algorithm has the capability of finding invalid game feature design flaws. Results indicated that the XCS algorithm is able to deliver stable validation of game feature testing results, can be a powerful tool and, therefore, worthy of further research in the Gaming domain.

In this method, hierarchical geometric models of graphic objects are constructed prior to the rendering process. The rendering process first calculates the visual acuity, which represents the importance of a graphic object for a human operator, from the gaze position of the operator. Second, the process selects a level from the set of hierachical geometric models depending on the value of visual acuity. That is, a simpler level of detail is selected where the visual acuity is lower, and a more complicated level is used where it is higher. Then, the selected graphic models are rendered on the display. This paper examines three visual characteristics to calculate the visual acuity: the central/peripheral vision, the kinetic vision, and the fusional vision.

Underactuation represents a particular form of a dynamic constraint, inherently present in many machines of interest (e.g., walking robots), and necessitates planning for long-term control solutions. A major limitation in motion planning techniques, especially for real-time implementation, is that they are only practical for relatively low degree-of-freedom problems. Here we present a model-based dimensionality reduction technique based on an extension of partial feedback linearization control into a task-space framework. This allows one to plan motions for a complex underactuated robot directly in a low-dimensional task-space, and to resolve redundancy with lower-priority tasks.

10.1109/SP40000.2020.00073,Intriguing Properties of Adversarial ML Attacks in the Problem Space,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent research efforts on adversarial ML have investigated problem-space attacks, focusing on the generation of real evasive objects in domains where, unlike images, there is no clear inverse mapping to the feature space (e.g., software). However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of problem-space attacks remain underexplored.This paper makes two major contributions. First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved semantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility. We shed light on the relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the concept of side-effect features as the byproduct of the inverse feature-mapping problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe several attacks from related literature across different domains.Second, building on our formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack on Android malware that overcomes past limitations. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android apps from 2017 and 2018 show the practical feasibility of evading a state-of-the-art malware classifier along with its hardened version. Our results demonstrate that ""adversarial-malware as a service"" is a realistic threat, as we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous adversarial applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes to generate an adversarial app. Yet, out of the 1600+ papers on adversarial ML published in the past six years, roughly 40 focus on malware [15]-and many remain only in the feature space.Our formalization of problem-space attacks paves the way to more principled research in this domain.

We also derive sufficient conditions for convergence in the mean sense of the online algorithms.

For example, in radar space time adaptive processing (STAP), training data from neighboring range cells is limited, since the statistical properties vary significantly over range and azimuth. Therefore, precluding straightforward implementation of standard detectors, for example, the whitening minimum variance distortionless response filter. Using random projections, we can reduce the dimension of the radar problem by random sampling, i.e. by projecting the data into a random d-dimensional subspace. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) theorem provides theoretical guarantees which explicitly states that the low dimensional data after random projections is only very slightly perturbed when compared to the data from the original problem in an l<sub>2</sub> norm sense. Random projections offers significant computational savings permitting possible real time solutions, however, at the cost of reducing the clairvoyant SINR for radar STAP. To alleviate this issue of SINR loss, we use localized random projections where the random projection matrix incorporates the look angle information, thereby minimizing the noise and interference effects from other angles, and increasing the SINR. We show that the resulting detector is CFAR, and the transformation matrix satisfies all the necessary conditions for the the JL theorem to hold.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7944428/,2017 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf),8-12 May 2017,ieeexplore

In such techniques, a single transmit-antenna is activated during each time instant and the activated antenna index is used to convey information. Due to the novel method of conveying information, a major criticism arises on the practicality of such techniques in the presence of real-time imperfections such as channel estimation errors. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to shed light on this issue. The performance of such systems are analyzed in the presence of Gaussian imperfect channel estimations. More specifically, the performance of SSK system consisting of N<sub>t</sub> transmit and N<sub>r</sub> receive antennas with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver is studied. The exact average bit error probability (ABEP) over Rayleigh fading channels is obtained in closed-form for N<sub>t</sub> = 2 and arbitrary N<sub>r</sub>; while union upper bound is used to compute the ABEP when N<sub>t</sub> &gt;; 2 and arbitrary N<sub>r</sub>. Furthermore, simple and general asymptotic expression for the ABEP is derived and analyzed. Besides, the effect of imperfect CSI on the performance of SM, Alamouti and SSK schemes considering different number of channel estimation pilots are studied and compared via numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that, on the contrary to the raised criticism, space modulation techniques are more robust to channel estimation errors than Alamouti since the probability of error is determined by the differences between channels associated with the different transmit antennas rather than the actual channel realization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6239909/,2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring),6-9 May 2012,ieeexplore

In this paper, we look at the issue of running large-scale simulation-based design space exploration problems on commercial Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds, namely Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine. To efficiently manage cloud resources used for execution, the key problem would be to accurately predict the running time for each simulation instance in advance. This is not trivial due to the currently wide range of cloud resource types which offer varying levels of performance. In addition, the widespread use of virtualization techniques in most cloud providers often introduces unpredictable performance interference. In this paper, we propose a resource and application-aware (RA2) prediction approach to combat performance variability on clouds. In particular, we employ neural network based techniques coupled with non-intrusive monitoring of resource availability to obtain more accurate predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on commercial cloud platforms using an evacuation planning design problem over a month-long period. The results demonstrate that it is possible to predict simulation execution times in most cases with high accuracy. The experiments also provide some interesting insights on how we should run similar simulation problems on various commercially available clouds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7789881/,2016 IEEE/ACM 20th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT),21-23 Sept. 2016,ieeexplore

Planning is more powerful in the configuration space than the task space. However, for robots with many degrees of freedom, this is challenging and computationally expensive. Sophisticated techniques for motion planning such as the Wavefront algorithm are limited by the high dimensionality of the configuration space, especially for robots with many degrees of freedom. For a neural implementation of the Wavefront algorithm in the configuration space, neurons represent discrete configurations and synapses are used for path planning. In order to decrease the complexity, we reduce the search space by pruning superfluous neurons and synapses. We present different models of self-organizing neural networks for this reduction. The approach takes real-life human motion data as input and creates a representation with reduced dimension. We compare six different neural network models and adapt the Wavefront algorithm to the different structures of the reduced output spaces. The method is backed up by an extensive evaluation of the reduced spaces, including their suitability for path planning by the Wavefront algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9536145/,2021 6th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM),3-5 July 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ISGTAsia49270.2021.9715603,Reinforcement Learning Based EV Charging Scheduling: A Novel Action Space Representation,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, several optimization techniques have been proposed for electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling. A common approach to intelligent scheduling is day-ahead planning, assuming full arrival time, departure time and energy demand knowledge or having them forecasted. However, the result from the day-ahead scheduling is limitedly applicable due to the uncertainties from the charging behaviors. With the deployment of the EV charging communication protocol defined in ISO 15118, it is realistic to assume that the EV will publish the departure time and the energy demand upon arrival. Thus, real-time scheduling, making decisions at each decision timeslot, can adapt to the new information and increase scheduling performance. Traditional model-based approaches like model predictive control (MPC) still require models, for example, for the future arrival times to solve the scheduling problem. Reinforcement learning (RL), a model-free approach, has also been successfully applied to real-time scheduling. RL can learn how to make decisions without relying on any system knowledge. This paper proposes a new action space construction method for an RL as proposed in a preceding work. The resulting action space size is significantly reduced compared to the original approach. Further, we compare the performance of a novel prioritized RL method to the original method. A publicly available charging session dataset is used for performance comparison in contrast to the original method. It is shown, that the prioritized RL performs better.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9715603/,2021 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia (ISGT Asia),5-8 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9249227,Reinforcement Learning with Converging Goal Space and Binary Reward Function,IEEE,Conferences,"Usage of a sparse and binary reward function remains one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning. In particular, when the environments wherein robotic agents learn are sufficiently vast, it is much more difficult to learn tasks because the probability of reaching the goal is minimal. A Hindsight Experience Replay algorithm was proposed to overcome these difficulties; however, problems persist that affect the learning speed and delay learning when a learning agent cannot receive proper rewards at the beginning of the learning process. In this paper, we present a simple method called Converging Goal Space and Binary Reward Function, which helps agents learn tasks easily and efficiently in large environments while providing a binary reward. At an early stage in training, a larger goal space margin facilitates the reward function for a more rapid policy learning. As the number of successes increases, the goal space is gradually reduced to the size used to the size used in the test. We apply this reward function to two different task experiments: sliding and throwing, which must be explored at a wider range than the reach of the robotic arms, and then compare the learning efficiency to that of experiments that only employ a sparse and binary reward function. We show that the proposed reward function performs better in large environments using physics simulation, and we demonstrate that the function is applicable to real world robotic arms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9249227/,2020 IEEE 16th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),20-21 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00028,Resource-Guided Configuration Space Reduction for Deep Learning Models,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep learning models, like traditional software systems, provide a large number of configuration options. A deep learning model can be configured with different hyperparameters and neural architectures. Recently, AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) has been widely adopted to automate model training by systematically exploring diverse configurations. However, current AutoML approaches do not take into consideration the computational constraints imposed by various resources such as available memory, computing power of devices, or execution time. The training with non-conforming configurations could lead to many failed AutoML trial jobs or inappropriate models, which cause significant resource waste and severely slow down development productivity. In this paper, we propose DnnSAT, a resource-guided AutoML approach for deep learning models to help existing AutoML tools efficiently reduce the configuration space ahead of time. DnnSAT can speed up the search process and achieve equal or even better model learning performance because it excludes trial jobs not satisfying the constraints and saves resources for more trials. We formulate the resource-guided configuration space reduction as a constraint satisfaction problem. DnnSAT includes a unified analytic cost model to construct common constraints with respect to the model weight size, number of floating-point operations, model inference time, and GPU memory consumption. It then utilizes an SMT solver to obtain the satisfiable configurations of hyperparameters and neural architectures. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of DnnSAT in accelerating state-of-the-art AutoML methods (Hyperparameter Optimization and Neural Architecture Search) with an average speedup from 1.19X to 3.95X on public benchmarks. We believe that DnnSAT can make AutoML more practical in a real-world environment with constrained resources.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402095/,2021 IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),22-30 May 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00844,Robust Neural Routing Through Space Partitions for Camera Relocalization in Dynamic Indoor Environments,IEEE,Conferences,"Localizing the camera in a known indoor environment is a key building block for scene mapping, robot navigation, AR, etc. Recent advances estimate the camera pose via optimization over the 2D/3D-3D correspondences established between the coordinates in 2D/3D camera space and 3D world space. Such a mapping is estimated with either a convolution neural network or a decision tree using only the static input image sequence, which makes these approaches vulnerable to dynamic indoor environments that are quite common yet challenging in the real world. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel outlier-aware neural tree which bridges the two worlds, deep learning and decision tree approaches. It builds on three important blocks: (a) a hierarchical space partition over the indoor scene to construct the decision tree; (b) a neural routing function, implemented as a deep classification network, employed for better 3D scene understanding; and (c) an outlier rejection module used to filter out dynamic points during the hierarchical routing process. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on the RIO-10 benchmark developed for camera relocalization in dynamic indoor environments. It achieves robust neural routing through space partitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by around 30% on camera pose accuracy, while running comparably fast for evaluation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9577932/,2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),20-25 June 2021,ieeexplore

Additionally, the dimensionality of the action manifold is lower than that of the state manifold, whose intrinsically correlated states are more difficult to capture in a learned manner.

Therefore, when considering some embedded software solutions, such as data-driven methods, time efficiency must be taken into account to improve energy efficiency. In this work, the energy efficiency of three data-driven methods: the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and the Random-Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network were assessed by using the creation of a real-time in-cylinder pressure sensor for diesel engines as a task.

It provides privacy protection to datasets when nearest neighbor queries need to be operated by an untrusted party (e.g., a public server). While different solutions have been proposed to support nearest neighbor queries on encrypted data, these existing solutions still encounter critical drawbacks either in efficiency or privacy. In light of the limitations in the current literature, we propose a novel approximate nearest neighbor search solution, referred to as Sparser, by leveraging a combination of space-filling curves, perturbation, and Order-Preserving Encryption. The advantages of Sparser are twofold, strengthening privacy and improving efficiency. Specifically, Sparser pre-processes plaintext data with space-filling curves and perturbation, such that data is sparse, which mitigates leakage abuse attacks and renders stronger privacy. In addition to privacy enhancement, Sparser can efficiently find approximate nearest neighbors over encrypted data with logarithmic time. Through extensive experiments over real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Sparser can achieve strong privacy protection under leakage abuse attacks and minimize search time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162585/,IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS),6-9 July 2020,ieeexplore

This representation blends well with linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs). However, in classical SBL the unknown variances are a priori independent, which is not suited for modeling group sparse signals, or signals whose variances have structure. To model signals with, e.g., exponentially decaying or piecewise-constant (in particular block-sparse) variances, we propose SSMs with dynamical and sparse variances (SSM-DSV). These are two-layer SSMs, where the bottom layer models physical signals, and the top layer models dynamical variances that are subject to abrupt changes. Inference and learning in these hierarchical models is performed with a message passing version of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which is a special instance of the more general class of variational message passing algorithms. We validated the proposed model and estimation algorithm with two applications, using both simulated and real data.

AI-assisted video analytics can provide valuable information and benefits in various domains. Face recognition, object detection, or movement tracing are prominent examples enabled by this technology. However, such mechanisms also entail threats regarding privacy and security, for example if the video contains identifiable persons. Therefore, adequate data protection is an increasing concern in video analytics. AI-assisted data protection mechanisms, such as face blurring, can help, but are often computationally expensive. Additionally, the heterogeneous hardware of end devices and the time-varying load on edge services need to be considered. Therefore, such systems need to adapt to react to changes during their operation, ensuring that conflicting requirements on data protection, performance, and accuracy are addressed in the best possible way. Sound adaptation decisions require an understanding of the adaptation options and their impact on different quality attributes. In this paper, we identify factors that can be adapted in AI-assisted data protection for video analytics using the example of a face blurring pipeline. We measure the impact of these factors using a heterogeneous edge computing hardware testbed.

We propose accelerated robotic deployment through task solving on low-level sensor data in simulation. A simulation allows for a lot of data, which is usually not available in a real world robotic setup due to cost and feasibility. Solving tasks in simulation is safe and a lot easier due to the huge amount of feedback from virtual sensory data. We present a novel sim2real architecture for converting simulated low level sensor data policies to high level real world policies. After solving a task we let the robot complete it a number of times in simulation using domain randomization, while doing so we save the simulated sensor data corresponding to the real robotic setup and actions taken. Given these sensor data and actions a task specific policy can be trained using our architecture.

The upper-tier SDN controller is responsible for the scheduling of UAV configuration, while the lower-tier SDN controller is responsible for regional coordination of UAV. The upper-tier SDN controller updates the tendency of network states by acquiring network states information in time interval. By simulating the network state in the next time interval, the optimal strategy of UAV scheduling of the next time interval is obtained by using the strategy iteration algorithm.

10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382562,Ubiquitous Semantic Space: A context-aware and coordination middleware for Ubiquitous Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"Ubiquitous computing poses the challenge of increased communication, context-awareness and functionality. In a highly dynamic and weekly connected ubiquitous environment, continuous access to the network (synchronous communication) is very difficult. So it's necessary to go for tuple space which provides asynchronous communication without any loss in data. Tuple space offers a coordination infrastructure for communication between autonomous entities by providing a logically shared memory along with data persistence, transactional security as well as temporal and spatial decoupling properties that make it desirable for distributed systems [2] such as ubiquitous computing. In order to automate the task and the system to be intelligent, context awareness is a must. This can be achieved by using semantic web technology. Existing middleware's for ubiquitous computing concentrates on RPC communication paradigm and deals with context-awareness separately. In our approach of constructing the middleware we provide common solution to both communication and context-awareness using ubiquitous semantic space. Ubiquitous semantic space [5] brings together tuple space, semantic web technologies and ubiquitous computing. Hence in this paper, we introduce a context-aware and co-ordination middleware framework for ubiquitous environment using ubiquitous semantic space. Ubiquitous semantic space uses ontologies to define the semantics of various concepts. Using ontologies facilitates different agents in the environments to have a common semantic understanding of different contexts. Ontology is represented using ontology web language, OWL [6]. We have modeled a ubiquitous semantic space ontology structure suitable for communicating conceptual information among the agents. Our model also incorporates context-triggered action which is more useful for real-time ubiquitous application having reactive behavior. For enabling context-triggered action, our model has reactive space into ubiquitous semantic space. Reactive space, stores rules written in SWRL [22], semantic web rule language and fired using JESS [3] reasoner at the appropriate time. The middleware could easily adapt to changes in the environment. The structure of the ubiquitous semantic space is designed in a fashion to have privacy among the communicating devices and the agents. Hence our middleware uses a decentralized architecture which supports asynchronous communication, context-awareness, context-sensitive communication, Privacy sensitive, adaptive to context-changes and reactive to emergency situation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4267986/,2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware,7-12 Jan. 2007,ieeexplore

Major concerns with existing defense mechanisms include non-generalizability across different attacks, models and large inference time. In this paper, we propose a generalized defense mechanism capitalizing on the expressive power of regularized latent space based generative models. We design an adversarial filter, devoid of access to classifier and adversaries, which makes it usable in tandem with any classifier. The basic idea is to learn a Lipschitz constrained mapping from the data manifold, incorporating adversarial perturbations, to a quantized latent space and re-map it to the true data manifold. Specifically, we simultaneously auto-encode the data manifold and its perturbations implicitly through the perturbations of the regularized and quantized generative latent space, realized using variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation in providing resilience against multiple attack types (black and white box) and methods, while being almost real-time.

This paper reports a dual-feature-based object recognition coprocessor that exploits both histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and Haar-like descriptors with a cell-based parallel sliding-window recognition mechanism. The feature extraction circuitry for HOG and Haar-like descriptors is implemented by a pixel-based pipelined architecture, which synchronizes to the pixel frequency from the image sensor. After extracting each cell feature vector, a cell-based sliding window scheme enables parallelized recognition for all windows, which contain this cell. The nearest neighbor search classifier is, respectively, applied to the HOG and Haar-like feature space.

To release humans from the repetitive and laborious job, we develop an autonomous trolley deployment robot to detect, transport and collect the scattered idle trolleys to recycling points. This paper will firstly illustrate the entire collection pipeline of the deployment robot system and then address the key challenge: partial to full point set registration. With the perception framework, the robot can detect the idle trolleys and acquire the pose of the trolleys on the ground, and then capture the trolley from behind, along the same direction for subsequent grasping and manipulation. With RGB-D camera and a segmentation Convolutional Neural Network, the robot can generate a partial surface point cloud of the detected trolley. The resulting point cloud, data and a pre-scanned full trolley point cloud, model, are matched by an implicit pose. To tackle the low accuracy and long computation time issues, a novel searching space-constrained point set registration algorithm is proposed to register the two overlapping point sets. Based on Branch-and-Bound (BnB) mechanism, the error between data and model is iteratively optimized. The constraint of searching space speeds up the global searching of the optimal pose, by pruning the candidate spaces which is impossible to contain the optimal result. To evaluate the performance, an airport trolley segmentation dataset and a point cloud dataset for registration are constructed. Experimental results on the datasets and synthetic dataset show that our method achieves higher accuracy and success rate than the previous methods.

The antecedent part of the TFS-SVMPC classifier is generated using an algorithm that is similar to fuzzy clustering. The dimension of the free parameter vector in the TS consequent part of the TFS-SVMPC is first reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). A linear SVM is then used to tune the subsequent parameters in the principal component space to give the system better generalization performance. The TFS-SVMPC is used as a classifier in a camera-based real-time object detection system. The object detection system consists of two stages. The first stage uses a color histogram of the global color appearance of an object as a detection feature for a TFS-SVMPC classifier. In particular, an efficient method for histogram extraction during the image scanning process is proposed for real-time implementation.

10.1109/TSMCB.2003.811114,Clustering and group selection of multiple criteria alternatives with application to space-based networks,IEEE,Journals,"In many real-world problems, the range of consequences of different alternatives are considerably different. In addition, sometimes, selection of a group of alternatives (instead of only one best alternative) is necessary. Traditional decision making approaches treat the set of alternatives with the same method of analysis and selection. In this paper, we propose clustering alternatives into different groups so that different methods of analysis, selection, and implementation for each group can be applied. As an example, consider the selection of a group of functions (or tasks) to be processed by a group of processors. The set of tasks can be grouped according to their similar criteria, and hence, each cluster of tasks to be processed by a processor. The selection of the best alternative for each clustered group can be performed using existing methods; however, the process of selecting groups is different than the process of selecting alternatives within a group. We develop theories and procedures for clustering discrete multiple criteria alternatives. We also demonstrate how the set of alternatives is clustered into mutually exclusive groups based on 1) similar features among alternatives; 2) ideal (or most representative) alternatives given by the decision maker; and 3) other preferential information of the decision maker. The clustering of multiple criteria alternatives also has the following advantages. 1) It decreases the set of alternatives to be considered by the decision maker (for example, different decision makers are assigned to different groups of alternatives). 2) It decreases the number of criteria. 3) It may provide a different approach for analyzing multiple decision makers problems. Each decision maker may cluster alternatives differently, and hence, clustering of alternatives may provide a basis for negotiation. The developed approach is applicable for solving a class of telecommunication networks problems where a set of objects (such as routers, processors, or intelligent autonomous vehicles) are to be clustered into similar groups.

Recently, depth-estimation networks with UNet encoder/decoder structures have been widely used. In these decoders, operations are repeated to gradually increase the image resolution, while decreasing the channel size. If the upsampling operation at a high magnification can be processed at once, the amount of computation in the decoder can be dramatically reduced. To achieve this, we propose a new network structure, i.e., a cocktail glass network. In this network, convolution layers in the decoder are reduced, and a novel fast upsampling method is used that is known as channel-to-space unrolling, which converts thick channel data into high-resolution data. The proposed method can be easily implemented using simple reshaping operations; therefore, it is suitable for reducing the depth-estimation network.

In this paper we study the DSN scheduling problem, which is the problem of assigning the DSN’s limited resources to its users within a given time horizon. The DSN scheduling problem is oversubscribed, meaning that only a subset of the activities can be scheduled, and network operators must decide which activities to exclude from the schedule.

Moreover, since the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of our proposed codes can be decomposed to 1-D PSK signal demodulation, the ML decoding of our codes can be implemented in a very efficient way.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1431123/,IEEE Transactions on Communications,May 2005,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIP.2020.3045634,"HRSiam: High-Resolution Siamese Network, Towards Space-Borne Satellite Video Tracking",IEEE,Journals,"Tracking moving objects from space-borne satellite videos is a new and challenging task. The main difficulty stems from the extremely small size of the target of interest. First, because the target usually occupies only a few pixels, it is hard to obtain discriminative appearance features. Second, the small object can easily suffer from occlusion and illumination variation, making the features of objects less distinguishable from features in surrounding regions. Current state-of-the-art tracking approaches mainly consider high-level deep features of a single frame with low spatial resolution, and hardly benefit from inter-frame motion information inherent in videos. Thus, they fail to accurately locate such small objects and handle challenging scenarios in satellite videos. In this article, we successfully design a lightweight parallel network with a high spatial resolution to locate the small objects in satellite videos. This architecture guarantees real-time and precise localization when applied to the Siamese Trackers. Moreover, a pixel-level refining model based on online moving object detection and adaptive fusion is proposed to enhance the tracking robustness in satellite videos. It models the video sequence in time to detect the moving targets in pixels and has ability to take full advantage of tracking and detecting. We conduct quantitative experiments on real satellite video datasets, and the results show the proposed HIGH-RESOLUTION SIAMESE NETWORK (HRSiam) achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance while running at over 30 FPS.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9350236/,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2021,ieeexplore

This combination of looking and reaching to the same target is used by infants to establish an implicit visuomotor representation of the peripersonal space, useful for both oculomotor and arm motor control. In this work, taking inspiration from such behavior and from primate visuomotor mechanisms, a shared sensorimotor map of the environment, built on a radial basis function framework, is configured and trained by the coordinated control of eye and arm movements. Computational results confirm that the approach seems especially suitable for the problem at hand, and for its implementation on a real humanoid robot. By exploratory gazing and reaching actions, either free or goal-based, the artificial agent learns to perform direct and inverse transformations between stereo vision, oculomotor, and joint-space representations. The integrated sensorimotor map that allows to contextually represent the peripersonal space through different vision and motor parameters is never made explicit, but rather emerges thanks to the interaction of the agent with the environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5703113/,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,March 2011,ieeexplore
10.1093/mnras/stab1879,Investigating cosmological GAN emulators using latent space interpolation,OUP,Journals,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently applied as a novel emulation technique for large-scale structure simulations. Recent results show that GANs can be used as a fast and efficient emulator for producing novel weak lensing convergence maps as well as cosmic web data in 2D and 3D. However, like any algorithm, the GAN approach comes with a set of limitations, such as an unstable training procedure, inherent randomness of the produced outputs, and difficulties when training the algorithm on multiple data sets. In this work, we employ a number of techniques commonly used in the machine learning literature to address the mentioned limitations. Specifically, we train a GAN to produce weak lensing convergence maps and dark matter overdensity field data for multiple redshifts, cosmological parameters, and modified gravity models. In addition, we train a GAN using the newest Illustris data to emulate dark matter, gas, and internal energy distribution data simultaneously. Finally, we apply the technique of latent space interpolation as a tool for understanding the feature space of the GAN algorithm. We show that the latent space interpolation procedure allows the generation of outputs with intermediate cosmological parameters that were not included in the training data. Our results indicate a 1–20 per cent difference between the power spectra of the GAN-produced and the test data samples depending on the data set used and whether Gaussian smoothing was applied. Similarly, the Minkowski functional analysis indicates a good agreement between the emulated and the real images for most of the studied data sets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9521040/,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,July 2021,ieeexplore

In this paper, we present a novel deep neural network, LPD-AE(Large-scale Place Description AutoEncoder Network), to obtain meaningful local and contextual features for the generation of latent space from 3D point cloud directly. The encoder network constructs the discriminative global descriptors to realize high accuracy and robust place recognition, which contributed by extracting the local neighbor geometric features and aggregating neighborhood relationships both in feature space and physical space. The decoder network performs hierarchical reconstruction on coarse key points and ultimately produce dense point clouds, which shows that it is capable of reconstructing a full point cloud frame from a single compact but high dimensional descriptor. Our proposed network demonstrates performance that is comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches. With the benefit of the LPD-AE, many computationally complex tasks that rely directly on point clouds can be effortlessly conducted on latent space with lower memory costs, such as relocalization, loop closure detection, and map compression reconstruction.

In this paper, we introduce a more general approximate inference framework for conjugate-exponential family models, which we call latent-space variational Bayes (LSVB). In this approach, we integrate out model parameters in an exact way, leaving only the latent variables. It can be shown that the LSVB approach gives better estimates of the model evidence as well as the distribution over latent variables than the VBEM approach, but in practice, the distribution over latent variables has to be approximated. As a practical implementation, we present a first-order LSVB (FoLSVB) algorithm to approximate this distribution over latent variables. From this approximate distribution, one can estimate the model evidence and the posterior over model parameters. The FoLSVB algorithm is directly comparable to the VBEM algorithm and has the same computational complexity. We discuss how LSVB generalizes the recently proposed collapsed variational methods [20] to general conjugate-exponential families. Examples based on mixtures of Gaussians and mixtures of Bernoullis with synthetic and real-world data sets are used to illustrate some advantages of our method over VBEM.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4670325/,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,Dec. 2008,ieeexplore

This framework investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of the signal space. Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using a series of signal segments selected with a sliding window. By investigating the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be discriminated from healthy models using a one-class learning algorithm. The framework enables us to construct a fault library when unknown faults occur, which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation.

The method uses an extended Kalman filter approach to jointly estimate the state of the system and learn the unknown system dynamics, via the parameters of the basis function expansion. The key contribution is a computational complexity reduction compared to a similar approach with globally supported basis functions. By using compactly supported radial basis functions and an approximate Kalman gain, the computational complexity is considerably reduced and is essentially determined by the support of the basis functions. The approximation works well when the system dynamics exhibit limited correlation between points well separated in the state-space domain.

However, most state-of-the-art approaches tend to perform poorly when the training and testing images are on different domains, e.g., the source domain and target domain, respectively, due to the spectral variability caused by different acquisition conditions. Transfer learning-based methods address this problem by pretraining in the source domain and fine-tuning on the target domain. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of data on the target domain has to be labeled and nonnegligible computational resources are required to retrain the whole network. In this article, we propose a new transfer learning scheme to bridge the gap between the source and target domains by projecting the HSI data from the source and target domains into a shared abundance space based on their own physical characteristics. In this way, the domain discrepancy would be largely reduced such that the model trained on the source domain could be applied to the target domain without extra efforts for data labeling or network retraining. The proposed method is referred to as physically constrained transfer learning through shared abundance space (PCTL-SAS). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as compared to the state of the art.

10.1109/ADCONIP.2017.7983776,A Bayesian learning and data mining approach to reaction system identification: Application to biomass conversion,IEEE,Conferences,"The growing environmental concern over the use of fossil fuels calls for alternative sources of energy with smaller environmental footprint, and biomass-derived fuels have been extensively investigated as a substitute. In biofuels production, the development of reaction networks and kinetic models is unquestionably a major challenge due to the difficulty in characterizing the reaction products. Therefore, there is a need for a better way to retrieve the information about the reaction from the available experimental data. This study uses a data mining and Bayesian learning approach to estimate the reaction network of the acid and base catalyzed hydrous pyrolysis of hemicellulose from Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Cluster analysis is used to model the system in terms of lumps and a Bayesian network structure-learning algorithm is then used to device a reaction network. Three Bayesian network structure-learning algorithms were implemented to estimate the reaction network. The results from each were identical, indicating that the model representing the reaction network is most probably in the optimal equivalence space. The model was compared against expert-based reaction models and the agreement is encouraging. A useful aspect of this model is its self-updating capability, i.e., the reaction model can provide a quantitative description of the effect of the change in the operation condition from spectroscopic data. Hence, the model may be used for the real time analysis of the investigated process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7983776/,2017 6th International Symposium on Advanced Control of Industrial Processes (AdCONIP),28-31 May 2017,ieeexplore

Ransomware is the type of malware that restricts access to files or blocks an infected device asking victims to pay fees in order to remove the restriction. The proposed detection procedure is based on the usage of neural network methodologies for the ransomware detection assuming features that related only with the utilization of the device resources. In the first part of the study, the System Monitor Service is proposed, that records the utilisation of the workstations' resources and extracts the corresponding features that describe their behaviour. The above tool monitors in real time the CPU, the memory, the disk space, the rate of reads and writes, the number of changed, created and deleted files. The second part of the methodology concerns the development of a neural network model that detects ransomware. Based on real data that arose from the System Monitor service, a model that fulfils the modern needs regarding the performance of the agents has been developed.

10.1109/INDIANCC.2019.8715586,A Chance Constrained Programming Based Multi-Criteria Decision Making Under Uncertainty,IEEE,Conferences,"Multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is a common practice followed in industries and academia. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques, Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to distribution of the data for uncertain parameters. However, the assumption that the uncertain parameters must follow some well-behaved probability distribution is a myth for most of the practical applications. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning algorithms with CCP and thereby make it data-driven. A novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling in these regions for use in CCP. The Fuzzy clustering mechanism used in the proposed method transforms the existing fuzzy C-means technique such that the decision variables are significantly reduced. This enables evolutionary optimizers to obtain better approximations of the uncertain space by identifying the true clusters. A highly nonlinear real life model for continuous casting from steelmaking industries is considered as a case study for testing the efficiency of data based CCP along with a comprehensive comparison between conventional CCP approach using box uncertainty set and proposed methodology. As the resulting CCP problem is multi-objective in nature, the Pareto solutions are obtained by NSGA II.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8715586/,2019 Fifth Indian Control Conference (ICC),9-11 Jan. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534250,A Comparative Study of Methods for Visualizable Semantic Embedding of Small Text Corpora,IEEE,Conferences,"Text embedding has recently emerged as a very useful and successful method for semantic representation. Following initial word-level embedding methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and topic-based bag-of-words approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the focus has turned to language models and text encoders implemented as neural networks - ranging from word-level models to those embedding whole documents. The distinctive feature of these models is their ability to infer semantic spaces at all levels based purely on data, with no need for complexities such as syntactic analysis or ontology building. Many of these models are available pre-trained on enormous amounts of data, providing downstream applications with general-purpose semantic spaces. In particular, embedding models at the sentence level or higher are most useful in applications because the meaning of text only becomes clear at that level. Most text embedding methods produce text embeddings in high-dimensional spaces, with a dimensionality ranging from a few hundred to thousands. However, it is often useful to visualize semantic spaces in very low dimension, which requires the use of dimensionality reduction methods. It is not clear what language models and what method of dimensionality reduction would work well in these cases. In this paper, we compare four text embedding methods in combination with three methods of dimensionality reduction to map three related real-world datasets comprising textual descriptions of items in a particular domain (sports) to a 2-dimensional semantic visualization space.

The project is designed to simulate fluid flow of a particle based on provided boundary conditions using High Performance Computing (HPC), with two-dimensional picture files as input to the software and fluid flow of a particle generated based on these image data. The Naiver Stokes Equation and the Lattice Boltzmann Equation are used to create these fluid flow particles.The governing equations based on the conservation law of fluid physical characteristics lead the primary structure of thermofluids investigations. Fluid flow is created depending on the item using the three governing equations from the conservation laws of physics. CFD simulation, on the other hand, which is a Iterative process is frequently computationally costly, memory-intensive, and time-consuming. A model based on convolutional neural networks, is proposed for predicting non-uniform flow in 2D to over come these disadvantages. The proposed approach thus aims to aid the behaviour of fluid particles on a certain system and to assist in the development of the system based on the fluid particles that travel through it. At the early stages of design, this technique can give quick feedback for real-time design revisions. In comparison to previous approximation methods in the aerodynamics domain, CNNs provide for efficient velocity field estimate and took less time then the previous approximation method.

The method can deal with both real motion blur and focal blur situations, while it does not require exact estimation of the blur kernel. To achieve this, the whole blur kernel space is divided into several degradative sub-spaces. Firstly, a CNN classifier is trained to predict which sub-space the blurry image belongs to at the patch level. Then, several patches voting for the specific blur kernel sub-space is developed. Given the strong learning ability of CNN, only one CNN model corresponding to a degradative kernel sub-space is trained to restore the sharp images in the image restoration step. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs well on the real blurring document images.

In this paper, we propose a decoding algorithm for controlling a drone in a three-dimensional (3D) space using steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI modality. SSVEP-based BCI has the great potential for use in virtual reality environment, which enables the user to control the drone using his/her brain activity in an first-person-view mode. Therefore, the user will be in a full control over the flight using BCI system by commanding the drone to take off, land, go forward, stop, and turn right/left.

The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space.

The lack of a proper assignment affects the scientific implementation of many subjects, such as routing, obstacle avoidance, and robot guidance. For this reason, the use of a clustering method is proposed in this article. Upon the entrance of a new agent, its position is mapped to the real field based on the clustering algorithm. After this mapping, the system begins to work according to the position of the agents, which is defined as the position of the centers of the clusters, as well as the rules defined in the knowledge-base. Considering the unknown and dynamic environment of the robot, some objects inherit common traits from multiple clusters. One reasonable solution for considering the cluster overlaps is to assign a set of membership degrees to each of them. Multiple membership degree assignments result from the fuzzy nature of the clusters. Due to the reduction of segmentations and the shrinkage of the search space, fuzzy clustering generally faces less computational overhead, while the identification and handling of vague, noisy, and outlier data also become much easier in them. The approach of the proposed method is based on the feasibility ideas and uses multi-core learning to identify clusters with complex data structures. The feasibility score of each data represents the percentages of the properties that data inherits from the clusters. Automatically adjusting the weights of the cores in an optimization framework, the proposed method avoids the damage caused by problems such as adopting inefficient cores, or irrelevant features.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420614/,"2021 26th International Computer Conference, Computer Society of Iran (CSICC)",3-4 March 2021,ieeexplore

Since accurate recognition of complex overlapped PD sources is essential for effective diagnosis, recently the focus of research has shifted to challenges related to real-time PD measurement that involve complexities in discriminating multi-source pulse signatures, variations in applied voltage, dynamics of PD patterns related to space charge effect etc. Though research studies have successfully utilized a gamut of machine intelligence techniques such as neural networks, Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines etc, effectiveness of recognition of complex overlapped PD sources based on space charge effect associated with PD has not been comprehensively established. This research focuses on implementation of Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) as a novel strategy for assessing the role of space charge and its associated memory propagation effect in PD signatures. Since Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based DRNN architecture augurs well for data involving sequence similarity recognition, the objective of this research is on establishing an indigenous approach of formulating identification markers to ascertain the role of space charge in PD patterns. The second objective is on establishing a unique approach to decipher state transitions of pulses using transition labels that describes the dynamics of PD signatures due to space charge effect.

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2018.8482045,A Novel Feature Selection Based Classification Algorithm for Real-Time Medical Disease Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"In the current medical databases, feature extraction and disease prediction are the essential requirements to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Alzheimer's diseases. Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets.

However, because of the nonlinear and highly complicated relationship between 3D world coordinate and 2D image coordinate, there is a need to develop effective VLP location algorithm to locate the positioning terminal using image sensor. Besides, due to the high computational cost of image processing, most existing VLP systems fail to deliver satisfactory performance in terms of real-time ability and positioning accuracy, both of which are crucial for the performance of indoor positioning system. The field of view (FOV) of image sensor affects the number of LEDs. Therefore, this paper proposes an image-sensor-based single-light positioning system and sets up relevant experiments to test the proposed system. What's more, the real-time ability is taken into consideration, which greatly improves the robustness and practicality of the system. As for the ID information of each LED, it utilizes the rolling shutter mechanism of the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor and combines machine learning algorithm to identify. Different from the traditional LED-ID modulation and demodulation methods, the LED-ID detection and recognition problem was treated as a classification problem in machine learning filed. In this paper, two typical linear classifiers in the case of binary classification problem are introduced. As the features of different LED-ID is linear separable in the feature space, linear classifiers are used to identify the LED-ID. The scheme proposed could improve the speed of LED-ID identification and the robustness of the system by off-line training for the classifiers and online recognition of LED-ID. When there's only one LED in the camera image, it means the distance between the terminal and LED is so close that the diameter of the LED can be measured. Therefore, it is able to use the proposed single-light positioning algorithm to achieve a high precision positioning and to solve the problem of limited number of LEDs in FOV in the existing literature. The proposed single-light positioning algorithm also has lower calculation complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed single-light positioning algorithm provides an accuracy of 7.39 cm and the computational time is 43.05 ms, which reflects a good performance in both accuracy and real-time ability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8720798/,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Electronics and Electrical Engineering (AUTEEE)",16-18 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/DSAA.2016.42,A Parallel Framework for Grid-Based Bottom-Up Subspace Clustering,IEEE,Conferences,"Clustering is a popular data mining and machine learning technique which discovers interesting patterns from unlabeled data by grouping similar objects together. Clustering high-dimensional data is a challenging task as points in high dimensional space are nearly equidistant from each other, rendering commonly used similarity measures ineffective. Subspace clustering has emerged as a possible solution to the problem of clustering high-dimensional data. In subspace clustering, we try to find clusters in different subspaces within a dataset. Many subspace clustering algorithms have been proposed in the last two decades to find clusters in multiple overlapping subspaces of high-dimensional data. Subspace clustering algorithms iteratively find the best subset of dimensions for a cluster from 2d-1 possible combinations in d-dimensional data. Subspace clustering is extremely compute intensive because of exhaustive search of subspaces, especially in the bottom-up subspace clustering algorithms. To address this issue, an efficient parallel framework for grid-based bottom-up subspace clustering algorithms is developed, considering popular algorithms belonging to this category.

Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities such as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity operations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an effective system for model development that streamlines data curation, training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges. The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a cloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset, to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses (positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code. Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality. Remote development, scalable compute, and automatic organization of data and artifacts have dramatically decreased iteration time while increasing reproducibility and system comprehension. Diverse, high-fidelity synthetic images that more closely replicate the real environment have improved model performance against real-world data.

Currently, rapidly, accurately and non-destructively diagnostic devices or systems for this disease have not been disclosed. In this study, the infected ears with different severities were picked up in key growth stages. The diseased area of wheat ear was extracted using hypergreen characteristic, and a total of 30 features of infected ears were chosen including color (Lab, HSI, HSV, YCbCr color space), texture (LBP and LLE dimension reduction), and shape (squareness, shape complexity, and eccentricity). Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed.

10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00080,A Real Time Anomaly Detection Method Based on Variable N-Gram for Flight Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Anomaly detection of flight data is vital to aviation safety. A real time anomaly detection for flight data can identify safety issues as soon as anomalies occur and improve the safety of aviation system. However, existing anomaly detection methods for flight data either perform not very well on unknown issues or are limited in their capabilities of real time detection. This paper provides a method to detect real time flight data anomalies with comparable detection performance. Firstly it transforms discrete and continuous flight data into discrete sequences. And each sequence obtained from discrete and continuous data is segmented into several subsequences by sliding a window of the specified size. More importantly, the variable length n-grams are obtained from each subsequence. Then all of unique n-grams become the feature space of the training data set. In this way each subsequence is mapped to this feature space and becomes an input feature vector of one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, anomalies in flight data can be detected in real time by the classifier learned on these feature vectors corresponding to subsequences. Experimental results show that it performs better to use linear kernel to train one-class SVM on our feature vectors than Gaussian kernel and the size of the sliding window takes a little effect on the performance of our detection method. Moreover, this method outperforms Multiple Kernel Anomaly Detection (MKAD) in real time anomaly detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622818/,2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 4th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),28-30 June 2018,ieeexplore

In TSS, vehicle detection plays a pivotal role as it is a vital process for further analysis such as vehicle classification and vehicle tracking. So far there has been a considerable amount of research proposed with single-pipeline Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to accommodate this subject. Although these studies achieved results with high accuracy, they required a large dataset and an implementation on dedicated hardware configuration. This paper presents a novel method with vision-based approach to detect moving vehicles from static surveillance cameras. Moving vehicles are detected and analysed by means of using a Neural Decision Tree accompanied with geometric features to classify vehicles and a Single Shot Detector to handle occlusion when inter-vehicle space between vehicles significantly decreases.

Engineers gain confidence in the correct functionality of the system before it is deployed into operation by executing verification activities. Choosing the right set of verification activities at the right system development stage, that is, designing a verification strategy (VS), is essential to balancing information discovery and verification cost. Only recently, quantitative methods have been proposed to support the design of verification strategies. However, their applicability in real-life scenarios is impractical due to their limited computational efficiency in the high dimensional solution space of the VS selection problem. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to search for a near-optimal VS. Specifically, the VS design problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which a value function is required. Then we combine tree search and a neural network (NN) to design a RL algorithm. In the RL algorithm, the value function is approximated as a NN that is trained in an iterative way. The near-optimal VS can be generated from the trained NN.

10.1109/ICARM52023.2021.9536056,A Review of Bilateral Teleoperation Control Strategies with Soft Environment,IEEE,Conferences,"In the past two decades, bilateral teleoperation with haptic feedback has attracted great research and application interests in both robotics and other areas. Initially triggered by the need to handle dangerous and remote distance tasks such as nuclear materials manipulation and space exploration, bilateral teleoperation has found its way into other applications as a result of development of control theory, robotic technology (both hardware and software) and latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Consequently, bilateral teleoperation is found facing new challenges brought by these new applications. One major and obvious change is the working environment for the slave manipulator: different from rigid or solid contact environments which are reasonably assumed in early applications in industrial, nuclear and aerospace applications, the slave environment is now more complex and often the objects in contact are much softer in term of stiffness and can not be described by simple elastic model if good teleoperation performance (accurate and transparent) is expected. In this paper, the research of bilateral teleoperation system considering soft environment in recent 20 years has been surveyed for the first time in literature, to the knowledge of the authors. Following the difference in real applications, in this review the definition of soft environment covers linear elastic environment with much lower stiffness than conventional industrial environment and nonlinear complex soft environment with/out time-varying characteristics. Accordingly, the surveyed control strategies and structures in recent literature to improve the stability and accuracy of bilateral teleoperation with soft environment are classified and explained. Finally, the main applications, current challenges and future perspectives of bilateral teleoperation with soft environment are discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9536056/,2021 6th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM),3-5 July 2021,ieeexplore

These vehicles could be air-, ground-, space-, or sea-based. This paper will review some of the most common software systems and methods that could be used for controlling such vehicles. Early attempts at mobile robots were confined to simple laboratory environments. For vehicles to operate in real-world noisy and uncertain environments, they need to include numerous sensors and they need to include both reactive and deliberative features. The most effective software systems have been hierarchical or multi-layered. Many of these systems mimic biological systems. This paper reviews several software approaches for autonomous vehicles. While there are similarities, there are differences as well. Most of these software systems are very difficult to use, and few of them have the ability to learn.

However, dynamic changes of topology and link status of satellite networks bring many challenges to routing optimization in the SGIN. Traditional routing optimization methods do not perform well, as they do not consider changes of topology and link status, as well as the association between flows. Since the Machine Learning (ML) technologies have shown significant advantages in dynamic routing optimization, we proposed a Machine Learning-based Space-ground Integration Networking (ML-SSGIN) framework that combines Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies to solve this challenge. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, is deployed to perform routing optimization, which can make routing decisions based on real-time link status. In particular, we utilize a neural network that integrates Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Dense layers for its actor and critic part to improve perceptual capabilities of contextual correlations between flows. We compared the proposed DDPG neural network with the one only having the Dense layers. The results show that the proposed architecture is feasible and effective.

The vulnerability of DNNs against such attacks can prove a major roadblock towards their real-world deployment. Transferability of adversarial examples demand generalizable defenses that can provide cross-task protection. Adversarial training that enhances robustness by modifying target model's parameters lacks such generalizability. On the other hand, different input processing based defenses fall short in the face of continuously evolving attacks. In this paper, we take the first step to combine the benefits of both approaches and propose a self-supervised adversarial training mechanism in the input space. By design, our defense is a generalizable approach and provides significant robustness against the unseen adversarial attacks (e.g. by reducing the success rate of translation-invariant ensemble attack from 82.6% to 31.9% in comparison to previous stateof-the-art).

A large body of existing research thoroughly investigates two broad categories of attacks targeting the integrity of NN models. The first category of attacks, commonly called Adversarial Examples, perturbs the model’s inference by carefully adding noise into input examples. In the second category of attacks, adversaries try to manipulate the model during the training process by implanting Trojan backdoors. Researchers show that such attacks pose severe threats to the growing applications of NNs and propose several defenses against each attack type individually. However, such one-sided defense approaches leave potentially unknown risks in real-world scenarios when an adversary can unify different attacks to create new and more lethal ones bypassing existing defenses.In this work, we show how to jointly exploit adversarial perturbation and model poisoning vulnerabilities to practically launch a new stealthy attack, dubbed AdvTrojan. AdvTrojan is stealthy because it can be activated only when: 1) a carefully crafted adversarial perturbation is injected into the input examples during inference, and 2) a Trojan backdoor is implanted during the training process of the model. We leverage adversarial noise in the input space to move Trojan-infected examples across the model decision boundary, making it difficult to detect. The stealthiness behavior of AdvTrojan fools the users into accidentally trusting the infected model as a robust classifier against adversarial examples. AdvTrojan can be implemented by only poisoning the training data similar to conventional Trojan backdoor attacks. Our thorough analysis and extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that AdvTrojan can bypass existing defenses with a success rate close to 100% in most of our experimental scenarios and can be extended to attack federated learning as well as high-resolution images.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9671964/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),15-18 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

Traffic sign recognition systems consist of an initial phase called Traffic Sign Detection (TSD), where images and colors are segmented and fed to the recognition phase. The most challenging process in TSR systems in terms of time consumption is the detection phase. The previous studies proposed different models for traffic sign detection, however, the computation time of these models still requires improvement for enabling real time systems. Therefore, this paper focuses on the computational time and proposes a novel time efficient color segmentation model based on logistic regression. This paper uses RGB color space as the domain to extract the features of our hypothesis; this has boosted the speed of the proposed model, since no color conversion is needed.

Due to the development of deep learning, traffic accident prediction can evolve from traditional machine learning algorithms to neural networks to predict the risk of accidents in a short period of time (hour level) in the future. However, the large urban area and sparse traffic accident samples will bring difficulties to deep learning prediction.

In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a space-gated memory network (SGMN) based on deep learning.

In order to verify the performance of the model, two real data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Summarization solutions running on web browsers can help the user to view and access summarized content of web pages in real time. In this paper we propose a framework for summarizing text viewed through mobile web browsers. The framework consists of an application that runs as part the mobile browser and extracts raw text. The text is then preprocessed and input to the summarization algorithm. The algorithm can be implemented either on the device as part of the browser engine or on a remote cloud service. The cloud service uses appropriate techniques to summarize the text and returns the summarized content to the device, where it is then displayed. During summarization, an extraction algorithm is used that uses ontology and a weighing mechanism to determine suitability score for each sentence. The sentences with the highest suitability scores are selected for inclusion in the summary as per the compression required. We describe a number of user interface elements in the mobile web browser to trigger the summarization and display the results, and compare the performance of publicly available summarization services.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6724210/,2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research,26-28 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN.2000.857872,A hippocampal model of visually guided navigation as implemented by a mobile agent,IEEE,Conferences,"Visually guided landmark navigation is based on space coding by hippocampal place cells (PC). A biologically realistic architecture of cooperative-competitive associative networks (implemented as a control system for mobile agents) emulates PC activity during local navigation in exploration and goal-retrieval. The system builds and stores panoramic views from landmarks and compares them with current inputs. Mismatch-induced low levels of recognition trigger a vigilance burst, which favors either the recognition of an alternative place category or the creation of a new category. The sole implementation of visual ""What"" and ""Where"" information does not restrain the generality of the model since several modalities could cooperate to give rise to more robust place field spatial categories. Providing the system with real visual inputs automatically extracted from a natural environment demonstrates that interspecies differences in PC coding result more from characteristics of the visual systems than from differences in processing. Conversely, differences in PC multiple codes within a system result from different levels of processing and/or different degrees of multimodality. Each code could be used within different navigational strategies. A control system derived from the model allows a mobile agent to learn a few places and the associated actions required to reach a goal. Generalisation property of the model provides the capacity to join the goal from any place in the learned environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/857872/,Proceedings of the IEEE-INNS-ENNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks.

10.1109/IROS.2014.6942859,A machine learning approach for real-time reachability analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Assessing reachability for a dynamical system, that is deciding whether a certain state is reachable from a given initial state within a given cost threshold, is a central concept in controls, robotics, and optimization. Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10% (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods. The proposed algorithms could find application in a variety of time-critical robotic applications, where the driving factor is computation time rather than optimality.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6942859/,2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,14-18 Sept. 2014,ieeexplore

According to the following two principles, an algorithm for producing ¿significant nodes¿ is designed.

10.1109/CCAAW.2017.8001611,A pattern matching approach to map cognitive domain ontologies to the IBM TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System,IEEE,Conferences,"Cognitive agents are typically utilized in autonomous systems for automated decision making. These systems interact in real time with their environments and are generally heavily power constrained. Thus there is a strong need for a real time agent running on a low power computing platform for these systems. This paper examines how some of the components of a cognitive agent can be mapped onto the IBM TrueNorth neurosynaptic system to achieve real time performance at low power. The agent examined is the Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP) architecture. Although it is geared towards autonomous decision making, CECEP also has applications in operations research, intelligence analysis, and data mining. One of the key components of CECEP is the Cognitive Domain Ontology (CDO), used for mining decisions from a large knowledge repository based on situational inputs and constraints. As CDOs are the most time and power consuming part of CECEP, we implemented them on the TrueNorth processor by mapping the solution space of CDOs into a pattern matching form.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8001611/,2017 Cognitive Communications for Aerospace Applications Workshop (CCAA),27-28 June 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706752,A perception evolution network for unsupervised fast incremental learning,IEEE,Conferences,"A perception evolution network (PEN) is proposed for unsupervised fast incremental (or on-line) learning in this paper. The network has two layers: the perception layer receives the external data from the reality environment and the knowledge layer learns and records the knowledge contained in the data from the perception layer in incremental and self-organizing way. In PEN model, new input channels can be added to the perception layer freely during learning. When the perception layer gets some new input channels, the network will create corresponding data transmission channels to the knowledge layer. The prior learned knowledge stored in the knowledge layer will be expanded to a higher-dimensional space which contains the attributes of the new input channels. For incremental (or on-line) learning, PEN can automatically obtain suitable prototypes and find the topology structure of the learning data without any priori knowledge. The noise processing mechanism guarantees PEN can work in the complex real-world (noisy) environment.

The authors propose a new trajectory planner for three DOF manipulators based on the kinetic energy of manipulators. The supplied electric power for the manipulators mainly depends on the differentiation of the kinetic energy. Therefore, the proposed method can take into consideration the constraints on the magnitude of the supplied electric power and joint velocities, i.e. one can realize a 'high speed motion' under the constraints on the supplied electric power and joint velocities.

The attribute values and ranges of these regions characterize the clusters. Clustering algorithms need to scale with the data base size and also with the large dimensionality of the data set. Further, these algorithms need to explore the embedded clusters in a subspace of a high dimensional space. However the time complexity of the algorithm to explore clusters in subspaces is exponential in the dimensionality of the data and is thus extremely compute intensive. Thus, parallelization is the choice for discovering clusters for large data sets. In this paper we present a scalable parallel subspace clustering algorithm which has both data and task parallelism embedded in it. We also formulate the technique of adaptive grids and present a truly unsupervised clustering algorithm requiring no user inputs. Our implementation shows near linear speedups with negligible communication overheads. The use of adaptive grids results in two orders of magnitude improvement in the computation time of our serial algorithm over current methods with much better quality of clustering.

We assess the feasibility of the proposed method on EEG recordings when the subject was performing mental arithmetic task which differ only in the difficulty level (easy: 1-digit addition v.s. 3-digit additions). Two different cortical connective networks were detected, and by comparing the functional connectivity networks in different work states, it was found that the task-difficulty is best reflected in the connectivity structure of sub-graphs extending over parietooccipital sites.

Most existing GNNs embed graph data into Euclidean space and thus are less effective to capture the ubiquitous hierarchical structures in real-world networks. Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) extend GNNs to hyperbolic space and thus are more effective to capture the hierarchical structures of graphs in node representation learning. In hyperbolic geometry, the graph hierarchical structure can be reflected by the curvatures of the hyperbolic space, and different curvatures can model different hierarchical structures of a graph. However, most existing HGNNs manually set the curvature to a fixed value for simplicity, which achieves a suboptimal performance of graph learning due to the complex and diverse hierarchical structures of the graphs. To resolve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Curvature Exploration Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network named ACE-HGNN to adaptively learn the optimal curvature according to the input graph and downstream tasks. Specifically, ACE-HGNN exploits a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework and contains two agents, ACE-Agent and HGNN-Agent for learning the curvature and node representations, respectively. The two agents are updated by a Nash Q-leaning algorithm collaboratively, seeking the optimal hyperbolic space indexed by the curvature.

In this paper, we propose a novel FPGA-based accelerator to speedup a matrix-factorization-based LRMC algorithm that uses stochastic gradient descent. The accelerator is a multi-pipelined architecture with parallel pipelines processing distinct data from a shared on-chip buffer. We propose two distinct on-chip buffer architectures based on a design-space exploration of the performance tradeoffs offered by two competing design methodologies: memory-efficiency versus concurrent conflict-free accesses. Our first design (i.e., memory-efficient design) organizes the buffer into banks and maximally utilizes available on-chip memory for matrix chunk processing without requiring complex address translation tables for on-chip addressing; however, it could incur bank conflicts when concurrent accesses to the same bank occur. The second design (i.e., bank-conflict-free design) exploits parallel multiport memory access and completely eliminates bank conflicts by duplicating the stored data; however, it has much higher on-chip RAM consumption. Intuitively, design one enables (slower) acceleration of (larger) chunks of the input matrix whereas design two enables (faster) processing of (smaller) matrix chunks but requires more iterations for processing the complete matrix. We propose a simple but efficient partitioning approach for supporting large input matrices that do not fit in the on-chip memory of FPGA. We also develop algorithmic optimizations based on matching to reduce data dependencies for parallel pipeline execution. We implement our designs on a state-of-the-art UltraScale+ FPGA device. We use real-life datasets for the evaluation and compare these two designs by varying the number of pipelines. The data dependency optimization results in at least 21.6 x data dependency reduction and improves the execution time by up to 66.3 x compared with non-optimized baseline designs. The memory-efficient design is also shown to be more scalable than the bank-conflict-free design. Compared with the state-of-the-art multi-core implementation and GPU implementation, the bank-conflict-free design achieves 5.4 x and 5.2 x speedup, respectively; the memory-efficient design achieves 16.7 x and 16.2 x speedup, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8279771/,2017 International Conference on ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig),4-6 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore

In each weak classifier selection cycle, the novel totally corrective algorithm reduces aggressively the upper bound on the training error by correcting coefficients of all weak classifiers.

We show experimentally that for the face detection problem, where large training sets are available, the technique does not overfit.

In the RTS game, the search time increases exponentially as the number of units increases. So it is not possible to achieve a complete search for the game tree in the strict circumstances of time constraints. In this paper, we propose a new tree model, and named T-AlphaBeta search algorithm. It can reduce the interval of Alpha and Beta appropriately by use the dynamic T value in the AlphaBeta[2] [3] algorithm.

The paper proposes a model-free based method that takes into consideration the actuator input and obstacle position while tracing an optimal path. The concept of machine learning enables to develop a path-planner which aims to avoid collisions with static obstacles. The ADP approach is realized to approximate the solution of the cost functional for optimization purpose by which the positions of the locally situated obstacles need not be priori-known until they are within a designed approximation safety envelope. The methodology is implemented to achieve the path-planning objective using dynamic programming technique. The Least-squares policy method serves as a recursive algorithm to approximate the value function for the domain, providing an approach for the finite space discrete control system. The concept behind the design of an obstacle-free path finder is to generate an optimal action that minimizes the local cost, defined by a functional, under constrained optimization. The most advantageous value function is described by the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation, that is impractical to solve using analytical methods. To overcome the complex calculations subject to HJB, a method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), called ADP is implemented.

The main advantages of adaptive HFCMAC control are: Better performance of the controller because adaptive HFCMAC can adjust itself to the changing enviroment and can be implemented in real time applications. The proposed method provides a simple control architecture that merges hierarchical structure, CMAC neural network and fuzzy logic. The input space dimension in CMAC is a time-consuming task especially when the number of inputs is huge this would be overload the memory and make the neuro-fuzzy system very hard to implement. This is can be simplified using a number of low-dimensional fuzzy CMAC in a hierarchical form.

However, this strategy does not employ effectively the extensive CPU and memory resources - which are used only for preprocessing, data transfer, and scheduling - available by default on the accelerated servers. In this paper, we study training algorithms for deep learning on heterogeneous CPU+GPU architectures. Our two-fold objective - maximize convergence rate and resource utilization simultaneously - makes the problem challenging. In order to allow for a principled exploration of the design space, we first introduce a generic deep learning framework that exploits the difference in computational power and memory hierarchy between CPU and GPU through asynchronous message passing. Based on insights gained through experimentation with the framework, we design two heterogeneous asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. The first algorithm - CPU+GPU Hogbatch - combines small batches on CPU with large batches on GPU in order to maximize the utilization of both resources. However, this generates an unbalanced model update distribution which hinders the statistical convergence. The second algorithm - Adaptive Hogbatch - assigns batches with continuously evolving size based on the relative speed of CPU and GPU. This balances the model updates ratio at the expense of a customizable decrease in utilization. We show that the implementation of these algorithms in the proposed CPU+GPU framework achieves both faster convergence and higher resource utilization than TensorFlow on several real datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9460628/,2021 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW),17-21 June 2021,ieeexplore

To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view videos. Our method learns a general skill embedding independently from the task context by using an adversarial loss. We combine a metric learning loss, which utilizes temporal video coherence to learn a state representation, with an entropy-regularized adversarial skill-transfer loss. The metric learning loss learns a disentangled representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. The adversarial skill-transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains. We show that the learned embedding enables training of continuous control policies to solve novel tasks that require the interpolation of previously seen skills.

Collecting labeled data for this task in order to help neural networks generalize better can be laborious and time-consuming.

Although these examples are not real sentences, they have been shown to act as a regularization method which can make neural networks more robust.

10.1109/SysTol.2013.6693835,Aerodynamic model inversion for virtual sensing of longitudinal flight parameters,IEEE,Conferences,"Introduction of Fly-By-Wire and increasing levels of automation improve the safety of civil aircraft significantly, and result in advanced capabilities for detecting, protecting and optimizing A/C guidance and control. However, this higher complexity requires the availability of some key flight parameters to be extended, to keep for a nominal behaviour of the flight control systems. Hence, the monitoring and the consolidation of those signals is a significant issue, usually achieved via many functionally redundant sensors to enlarge the way those parameters are measured. This solution penalizes the overall system performance in terms of weight, power consumption, space requirements, and extra maintenance needs. Other alternatives rely on signal processing or model-based techniques that make a global use of all or part of the sensor data available, supplemented by a model-based simulation of the flight mechanics (analytical redundancy). That processing achieves a real-time estimation of the critical parameters and yields dissimilar signals. Filtered and consolidated information are delivered in unfaulty conditions by estimating an extended state vector including wind components, and can replace failed signals in degraded conditions (virtual probes). Accordingly, this paper describes a new model-based approach allowing the longitudinal flight parameters of a civil A/C to be estimated on-line, through an Aerodynamic Model Inversion. To facilitate onboard implementation, the main aerodynamic coefficients are approximated by a set of surrogate models. Results are displayed to evaluate the performances of that approach in different flight conditions, including external disturbances and modeling errors.

In addition, the refugees suffer from the shortage of necessary resources due to impaired life infrastructure, such as damaged roads and communication networks. The degree of reducing damage depends on the amount of food, water, daily necessities and communication resources required by each shelter. How to effectively and efficiently allocate resources according to grasp the exact need of a disaster situation will be an important issue. We estimate the degree of the disaster by collecting and analyzing big data from the SNS, and building a platform for the communication resources to be efficiently and effectively allocated. In order to achieve this goal, we are challenging the following issues A) Understanding situations (user requirements) after disaster occur The SNS streams large scale semantic information about real time situation in society, especially during and after disaster. It is both domain-specific and computational challenge in processing the heterogeneous large data set to extract the exact situational content with reduced semantic uncertainty. The machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NPL) tool kits are useful in semantic analysis, but still needs domain-specific implementation and computational improvement for the situation understanding from the SNS big data. B) Understanding distribution patterns of situations/users' requirements The disaster related situation is spatiotemporally correlated, and varies dynamically in space and time. It is also domain-specific and computational challenge in estimating the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the disaster affect based on the spatial big data from SNS. The scan statistics such as the spatial scan have provided well tested mathematical tools and software for spatial data mining. However, new methodologies are necessary since the assumptions have to be different when it meets the spatial big data in SNS. And the computational complexity in spatial big data is also a bottleneck for real-time processing. C) Solving uncertainty of big crowd data One of the major features in big crowd data, e.g., SNS data, is uncertainty behind the data.

And they can obtain new purchase opportunities because they can know what kinds of related stores are around them. Thus, they can do efficient purchasing activities. In this paper, we discuss service providing information of related stores efficiently in order to support users' efficient purchasing activities. And we propose an ambient service model that consists of three layers: structured (purchase-related) information space, real-life space, and ambient information space. In this model, a lot of store information collected from the web is grouped and structured automatically by relation in terms of purchasing. And users search information of related stores by using an ambient query that is automatically created by their context in real-life space.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device.

An ensemble-learning approach was recently proposed that trains multiple base learners on different vector-space views of the given log, and a probabilistic meta-model that combines the predictions of the discovered base classifiers. However, the sequential centralised implementation of this learning approach makes it unsuitable for real applications, where large volumes of traces are produced continuously, while both deviant and normal behaviours tend to change over the time. We here propose an online deviance detection framework that leverages a novel incremental learning scheme, which extracts different base models from different chunks of a trace stream, and dynamically combines them in an ensemble model. Notably, the system is based on a p2p architecture that allows it to distribute the entire learning procedure among multiple nodes and to exploit the power of HPC resources (e.g. cloud computing environments). Preliminary tests on a real-life log confirmed the validity of the approach, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8514339/,2018 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS),16-20 July 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/CEC45853.2021.9504837,An Entropy Driven Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Feature Selection,IEEE,Conferences,"Feature selection is an important research field in machine learning since high-dimensionality is a common characteristic of real-world data. It has two main objectives, which are to maximize the classification accuracy while minimizing the number of selected features. As the two objectives are usually in conflict with each other, it makes feature selection a multi-objective problem. However, the large search space and discrete Pareto front makes it not easy for existing evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. In order to deal with the above mentioned difficulties in feature selection, an entropy driven multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to remove redundant feature and decrease computational complexity. First, its basic idea is to model feature selection as a multiobjective optimization problem by optimizing the number of features and the classification accuracy in supervised condition simultaneously. Second, a particle initialization strategy based on information entropy is designed to improve the quality of initial solutions, and an adaptive velocity update rule is used to swap between local search and global search. Besides, a specified discrete nondominated sorting is designed. These strategies enable the proposed algorithm to gain better performance on both the quality and size of feature subset. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can maintain or improve the quality of Pareto fronts evolved by the state-of-the-art algorithms for feature selection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9504837/,2021 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC),28 June-1 July 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/CEC.2019.8790094,An Evolutionary Machine Learning Approach Towards Less Conservative Robust Optimization,IEEE,Conferences,"In the recent era, multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is gaining importance due to its wide range of applicability. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques, Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to data in uncertain regions. However, solutions of RO may actually deviate from actual results in real scenarios, due to conservative sampling. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate unsupervised machine learning algorithms with RO which thereby makes it data-driven. A novel evolutionary fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enables intelligent Sobol based sampling in these regions for use in RO. Results of two test cases with varying dimensions are presented along with a comprehensive comparison between conventional RO approach using box uncertainty set and proposed methodology. Considered case studies include highly nonlinear real life model for continuous casting from steelmaking industries, where a time expensive multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is formulated to resolve the conflict in productivity and energy consumption. Optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN) surrogate assisted optimization under uncertainty for casting model is performed to obtain solutions in realistic time.

Hierarchical feature learning is at the crux to the problems of discovery and recognition. We present a multilayered convergent neural architecture for storing repeating spatially and temporally coincident patterns in data at multiple levels of abstraction. The bottom-up weights in each layer are learned to encode a hierarchy of over complete and sparse feature dictionaries from space- and time-varying sensory data by recursive layer-by-layer spherical clustering. This density-based clustering algorithm ignores outliers by the use of a unique adaptive threshold in each neuron's transfer function. The model scales to full-sized high-dimensional input data and also to an arbitrary number of layers, thereby possessing the capability to capture features at any level of abstraction. It is fully-learnable with only two manually tunable parameters.

10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0041,Android Malware Detection: Building Useful Representations,IEEE,Conferences,"The problem of proactively detecting Android Malware has proven to be a challenging one. The challenges stem from a variety of issues, but recent literature has shown that this task is hard to solve with high accuracy when only a restricted set of features, like permissions or similar fixed sets of features, are used. The opposite approach of including all available features is also problematic, as it causes the features space to grow beyond reasonable size. In this paper we focus on finding an efficient way to select a representative feature space, preserving its discriminative power on unseen data. We go beyond traditional approaches like Principal Component Analysis, which is too heavy for large-scale problems with millions of features. In particular we show that many feature groups that can be extracted from Android application packages, like features extracted from the manifest file or strings extracted from the Dalvik Executable (DEX), should be filtered and used in classification separately. Our proposed dimensionality reduction scheme is applied to each group separately and consists of raw string preprocessing, feature selection via log-odds and finally applying random projections. With the size of the feature space growing exponentially as a function of the training set's size, our approach drastically decreases the size of the feature space of several orders of magnitude, this in turn allows accurate classification to become possible in a real world scenario. After reducing the dimensionality we use the feature groups in a light-weight ensemble of logistic classifiers. We evaluated the proposed classification scheme on real malware data provided by the antivirus vendor and achieved state-of-the-art 88.24% true positive and reasonably low 0.04% false positive rates with a significantly compressed feature space on a balanced test set of 10,000 samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7838145/,2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),18-20 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore

YCrCb color space combined with skin color detection is used to remove the background image and form a segmented image. Detection contour with convex hull algorithms are used to localize and save an area of the hand. Convexity defect algorithms then are used to extract the hand gesture's features using a radiant line from the center of the palm to the fingertips. The classification of hand gesture that performs sign alphabets is accomplished using back propagation neural network algorithm in order to determine a suitable alphabet. The performance test of the system is done by recognizing some variation hand gesture poses for Indonesian sign language alphabet. The results show that the system can detect the position of the user's hand. Furthermore, the system can recognize the alphabet sign from user hand gesture input, reaching 91.66% success rate in testing using Android devices in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7863311/,2016 8th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE),5-6 Oct. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/BigData.2016.7841008,Android malware detection with weak ground truth data,IEEE,Conferences,"For Android malware detection, precise ground truth is a rare commodity. As security knowledge evolves, what may be considered ground truth at one moment in time may change, and apps once considered benign turn out to be malicious. The inevitable noise in data labels poses a challenge to creating effective machine learning models. Our work is focused on approaches for learning classifiers for Android malware detection in a manner that is methodologically sound with regard to the uncertain and ever-changing ground truth in the problem space. We leverage the fact that although data labels are unavoidably noisy, a malware label is much more precise than a benign label. While you can be confident that an app is malicious, you can never be certain that a benign app is really benign or just an undetected malware. Based on this insight, we leverage a modified Logistic Regression classifier that allows us to learn from only positive and unlabeled data, without making any assumptions about benign labels. We find Label Regularized Logistic Regression to perform well for noisy app datasets, as well as datasets where there is a limited amount of positive labeled data, both of which are representative of real-world situations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7841008/,2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),5-8 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/DSC50466.2020.00029,Anobeat: Anomaly Detection for Electrocardiography Beat Signals,IEEE,Conferences,"Electrocardiography signals are composed of variform heartbeats which could indicate the condition of the heart and reveal the risk of heart attacks. Many existing classification-based works for abnormal beats detection are limited by the class-imbalanced data or labor-intensive manual annotation bias. A promising trend to address the issue is to identify the abnormal data that differs from the normal data by utilizing normal (oneclass) data to learn the manifold and detect the anomaly to the unseen and unlabeled data in an/aunsupervised/semi-supervised manner. In this paper, we propose Anobeat, a semi-supervised approach, to perform the abnormal beat detection by facilitating adversarial regularized autoencoders constrained with multifeature and reconstruction error. In order to obtain a robust and reasonable latent coding, we deploy two discriminators in the latent space and visual space to distinguish real and fake features and minimize the distance between two features to train the visual discriminator in alternate steps. Meanwhile, we minimize the reconstruction error and maximum distance between input and noise features to improve the decoder. The adversarial multi-feature constraints enable the generator to learn the latent representations of the target normal data and reconstruct the beats properly. Experiments showed that Anobeat achieved ROC-AUC of 0.960 and 0.894 in the MIT-BIH intrapatient and inter-patient dataset respectively, which outperforms the most competitive baseline by 1.61% and 0.62% respectively. Anobeat also performs comparative robustness and shows good interpretability in the European ST-T and MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172828/,2020 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC),27-30 July 2020,ieeexplore

Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

With the constant development of global urbanization, human population has increased drastically in the past decades. Searching for a publicly available parking space in a highly populated area can be daunting and time consuming. No matter how much time is spent to find a vacant parking space, it always causes traffic congestion in the area. To alleviate these problems, it is of utmost importance to have a system that can detect and display the vacant parking spaces in real-time. This paper has conducted a study of anticipation of parking vacancy using convolutional neural network called YOLOv3 in a university campus. Image data is gathered from the video capture of the university’s campus open space parking lot. The YOLOv3 algorithm is used to train and predict whether the space is vacant or occupied.

10.1109/ICSME.2019.00057,Application of Philosophical Principles in Linux Kernel Customization,IEEE,Conferences,"Philosophical principles are very useful in customization of Linux kernel, e.g., the answer for the question: ""For the pointer to the start address of page table, is it a physical address or a virtual address?"" can be derived by one simple philosophical principle: the depth of recursion is limited. This is because if the pointer were a virtual address, there would be another new page table to store the translation information of this virtual address, but who was responsible for storing the translation information of the start address of this new page table? This would result an infinite recursion. So the pointer definitely is a physical address. In fact, the usefulness of philosophical principles comes from the reduction of searching space. And this reduction is very important in customization of Linux kernel, for it could cut down the size of the new code needed to be read. This is especially valuable when considering that Linux kernel is continuously updating and huge now. Another example to further demonstrate the reduction of searching space in customization is showed in the following: in customization of file system in kernel version 3.10, the question: ""Does the Linux kernel itself maintain the consistency between the buffer cache and the page cache?"". This is a hard problem in practice, for without any guidance of philosophical principle, a developer has to read all of the code in Linux kernel to get a precise answer. The tricky part of this question is that if the developer only read a part of the codes and doesn't find any mechanisms for maintenance of cache consistency, the conclusion of non-existence of such mechanisms still can not be drawn, for there's still a possibility that such mechanisms exist in the codes not explored. Besides, if the developer search internet to find the answer, assume that the developer is lucky enough, he/she finally finds one program example on a web page shows that the inconsistency may raise between buffer cache and page cache. He/she still can not get the conclusion that Linux kernel does not maintain such consistency, because that program example maybe is only valid in a specific scenario, e.g. in kernel version 2.26, not 3.10. But we can get a satisfied answer by using the philosophical principle: the cost of management process should be far less than the value created by being managed process. By this principle, it can be drawn that Linux kernel doesn't maintain the consistency between the buffer cache and page cache in kernel 3.10. This is because that the data in buffer cache and page cache is highly dependent on application logic, so if Linux kernel wanted to maintain such consistency, it would have to track all these applications, which cost was much higher than the benefits that these applications could produce. However, the successful application of philosophical principles depends on two factors: firstly, establishment of a mapping between concepts in Linux system and well-known concepts in human society. This is not a new idea, e.g. the word of ""cost"" is a concept first appeared in human society, not in computer science, but nowadays, developers establish a mapping between this concept and concepts in computer science. Although the idea is very old, it is still very effective. Since well-known concepts in human society are familiar to most developers and are what they have in common, the cost of applying philosophical principles is reduced. Besides this, already existing cause-effect relations among concepts in human society can be highly possible to be reused in philosophical deduction in Linux kernel. E.g, in the mapping we established, process is treated as a human and since in religion of human society, God creates humankind, it is natural to derive that there's one process that creates all other processes in Linux system with high probability. Secondly, a concrete model with many qualitative and quantitative details should be the basis of philosophical deduction. We build such model according to our past experiences and the construction of the model follows the philosophical principle: unfold the complexity only when it is necessary. E.g., in this model, for a specific detail, it is covered only when it is required in practice. This is to lower down the cost of modelling huge and continuously evolving Linux kernel. This model is very important, without it, philosophical deduction is impossible. But it is really a hard work, according to our experiences, it needs at least 6-years of work on Linux kernel for one developer to build it. Although philosophical principles are very useful in practice, there's a big gap on the recognition of philosophical principles between academic researchers and industry practioners. E.g., some academic researcher seriously doubts whether the mapping above, which mentioned God, is helpful. In fact, it is, for by this mapping, a developer will know that the existence of the process, which is the origin of all other processes, is highly possible and also that process maybe is not easily observed. This is true, for that process is the process which PID is zero and that process can not be observed by Linux command: ""ps -e"". That process is a very valuable point of customization, e.g., by modifying that process, all processes in the Linux will be affected. Why does this big gap exist? We believe there're at least three reasons: i. The bias on philosophical principles. This usually comes from the observation that some developers establish wrong mapping between the philosophical principles and the objects in real world. But is that true for those that has been verified many times in practice? ii. Wrong expectations. E.g., hope to get the precise answer when applying philosophical principles, instead of reducing the searching space. iii. Some academic researchers do not realize that a good philosophical principle usually is the result of a deep learning process of many years by human brain. Finally, we suggest that more efforts should be put on the studying of philosophical principles in program understanding and we believe that in the near future, the philosophical principles plus AI will be a trend in program understanding.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8919057/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

This way we obtain a manifold of movements, which dimensionality is usually much smaller than the dimensionality of a full space of movement primitives. Next we refine the policy by means of reinforcement learning on the approximating manifold, which results in a learning problem constrained to the low dimensional manifold. We show that in some situations, learning on the low dimensional manifold can be implemented as an error learning algorithm. We apply golden section search to refine the control policy. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with an extended parameter set, which combines learning in constrained domain with learning in full space of parametric movement primitives, which makes it possible to explore actions outside of the initial approximating manifold.

This concept delves into the way a massive volume of data is acquired, processed, analyzed to extract insight from available data. In particular, big data analytics alludes to applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques, data mining techniques, time-series forecasting methods. Decision-makers in power systems have been long plagued by incapability and weakness of classical methods in dealing with large-scale real practical cases due to the existence of thousands or millions of variables, being time-consuming, the requirement of a high computation burden, divergence of results, unjustifiable errors, and poor accuracy of the model. Big data analytics is an ongoing topic, which pinpoints how to extract insights from these large data sets. The extant article has enumerated the applications of big data analytics in future power systems through several layers from grid-scale to local-scale. Big data analytics has many applications in the areas of smart grid implementation, electricity markets, execution of collaborative operation schemes, enhancement of microgrid operation autonomy, management of electric vehicle operations in smart grids, active distribution network control, district hub system management, multi-agent energy systems, electricity theft detection, stability and security assessment by PMUs, and better exploitation of renewable energy sources.

10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629804,Augmented Reality Assisted Surgical Navigation System for Epidural Needle Intervention,IEEE,Conferences,"An augmented reality (AR)-assisted surgical navigation system was developed for epidural needle intervention. The system includes three components: a virtual reality-based surgical planning software, a patient and tool tracking system, and an AR-based surgical navigation system. A three-dimensional (3D) path plan for the epidural needle was established on the preoperative computed tomography (CT) image. The plan is then registered to the intraoperative space by 3D models of the target vertebrae using skin markers and real-time tracking information. In the procedure, the plan and tracking information are transmitted to the head-mounted display (HMD) through a wireless network such that the device directly visualizes the plan onto the back surface of the patient. The physician determines the entry point and inserts the needle into the target based on the direct visual guidance of the system. An experiment was conducted to validate the system using two torso phantoms that mimic human respiration. The experimental results demonstrated that the time and the number of X-rays required for needle insertion were significantly decreased by the proposed method (43.6±20.55sec, 2.9±1.3times) compared to those of the conventional fluoroscopy-guided approach (124.5 ± 46.7s, 9.3±2.4times), whereas the average targeting errors were similar in both cases.

Augmented Reality techniques are used to enhance paper maps digitally resulting in a 3D visualization space with some interactions. The dynamic information of the terrain, placing virtual objects and interaction are features of the digital world that are superimposed onto a paper map.

However, the traditional network of the ground cannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among vehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the whole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the transmission delay.

10.1145/3238147.3238175,AutoConfig: Automatic Configuration Tuning for Distributed Message Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Distributed message systems (DMSs) serve as the communication backbone for many real-time streaming data processing applications. To support the vast diversity of such applications, DMSs provide a large number of parameters to configure. However, It overwhelms for most users to configure these parameters well for better performance. Although many automatic configuration approaches have been proposed to address this issue, critical challenges still remain: 1) to train a better and robust performance prediction model using a limited number of samples, and 2) to search for a high-dimensional parameter space efficiently within a time constraint. In this paper, we propose AutoConfig - an automatic configuration system that can optimize producer-side throughput on DMSs. AutoConfig constructs a novel comparison-based model (CBM) that is more robust that the prediction-based model (PBM) used by previous learning-based approaches. Furthermore, AutoConfig uses a weighted Latin hypercube sampling (wLHS) approach to select a set of samples that can provide a better coverage over the high-dimensional parameter space. wLHS allows AutoConfig to search for more promising configurations using the trained CBM. We have implemented AutoConfig on the Kafka platform, and evaluated it using eight different testing scenarios deployed on a public cloud. Experimental results show that our CBM can obtain better results than that of PBM under the same random forests based model. Furthermore, AutoConfig outperforms default configurations by 215.40% on average, and five state-of-the-art configuration algorithms by 7.21%-64.56%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9000079/,2018 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE),3-7 Sept. 2018,ieeexplore

The approach is based on the theory of statistical learning. The root images are preprocessed with algorithms for intensity normalization, segmentation, edge detection and scale space corner detection. The features used in the experiments are the Zernike moments of the bi-level image patch centered around high curvature detections. Zernike moments are orthogonal and thus can be rightly assumed to be independent. The densities of the feature vectors for different classes are modelled with Gaussian mixture model (GMM), with a diagonal covariance matrix. The parameters for the feature's distribution densities for different classes are learnt by expectation maximization. Bayes rule and Neymann-Pearson criteria is used to design the classification method. We experiment with different orders of Zernike moments and different number of Gaussians in the GMM.

We perceive objects in the world as meaningful entities only over certain ranges of scale. This fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. After a brief review of the main ideas behind a scale-space representation, I describe a systematic methodology for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting image structures. Specifically, I show how this idea can be used for formulating feature detectors which automatically adapt their local scales of processing to the local image structure.

The pervasiveness of graphs today has raised the demand for algorithms that can answer various questions: Which products would a user like to purchase given her order list? Which users are buying fake followers to increase their public reputation? Myriads of new graph mining algorithms are proposed every year to answer such questions - each with a distinct problem formulation, computational time, and memory footprint. This lack of unity makes it difficult for a practitioner to compare different algorithms and pick the most suitable one for a specific application. These challenges - even more severe for non-experts - create a gap in which state-of-the-art techniques developed in academic settings fail to be optimally deployed in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoGM, an automated system for graph mining algorithm development. We first define a unified framework UnifiedGM that integrates various message-passing based graph algorithms, ranging from conventional algorithms like PageRank to graph neural networks. Then UnifiedGM defines a search space in which five parameters are required to determine a graph algorithm. Under this search space, AutoGM explicitly optimizes for the optimal parameter set of UnifiedGM using Bayesian Optimization. AutoGM defines a novel budget-aware objective function for the optimization to incorporate a practical issue - finding the best speed-accuracy trade-off under a computation budget - into the graph algorithm generation problem.

This transformation system aims to be able to directly measure the distance of objects in real terms without first changing the environmental image from an omni field to a flat plane with conventional camera calibration techniques. This process can replace manual calibration with a variety of field size changes The system can transform with mean error 0.0000026 on epoch 10000 using “conda-tensorflowneural network” libraries. It can transform the position of the ball from the omni space to the cartesian space.

10.1109/ICDL-EpiRob48136.2020.9278071,Bayesian Optimization for Developmental Robotics with Meta-Learning by Parameters Bounds Reduction,IEEE,Conferences,"In robotics, methods and softwares usually require optimizations of hyperparameters in order to be efficient for specific tasks, for instance industrial bin-picking from homogeneous heaps of different objects. We present a developmental framework based on long-term memory and reasoning modules (Bayesian Optimisation, visual similarity and parameters bounds reduction) allowing a robot to use meta-learning mechanism increasing the efficiency of such continuous and constrained parameters optimizations. The new optimization, viewed as a learning for the robot, can take advantage of past experiences (stored in the episodic and procedural memories) to shrink the search space by using reduced parameters bounds computed from the best optimizations realized by the robot with similar tasks of the new one (e.g. bin-picking from an homogenous heap of a similar object, based on visual similarity of objects stored in the semantic memory). As example, we have confronted the system to the constrained optimizations of 9 continuous hyperparameters for a professional software (Kamido) in industrial robotic arm bin-picking tasks, a step that is needed each time to handle correctly new object. We used a simulator to create bin-picking tasks for 8 different objects (7 in simulation and one with real setup, without and with meta-learning with experiences coming from other similar objects) achieving goods results despite a very small optimization budget, with a better performance reached when meta-learning is used (84.3 % vs 78.9 % of success overall, with a small budget of 30 iterations for each optimization) for every object tested (p-value=0.036).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9278071/,2020 Joint IEEE 10th International Conference on Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL-EpiRob),26-30 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/DSC.2016.48,Behavior Analysis Based SMS Spammer Detection in Mobile Communication Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"In a communication network, automatic short message service (SMS) spammer detection is a big challenge for a telecommunication operator nowadays, especially with the development of the rich communication services (RCS). Three main problems exist in the areas of research and real practice. They are (1) the whole-volume content based SMS spam detection techniques cannot be easily used on the side of network due to the issue of user privacy, (2) traditional ways to filter the spam according to the combination of key words and sending frequency can be easily bypassed by adding the interference words, (3) Most of them result in a great deal of manual review after the automatic filtering due to a low precision rate. To make up the aforementioned gaps, we study the user behavior characteristics. A two-dimensional visualized result indicates that any combination of two user behavior attributes cannot distinguish the abnormal users from the whole set by splitting the 2-dimensional space. Thus, the integration of multiple user behavior attributes is exploited to train the classifier in a labeled set by machine learning algorithms, respectively, including decision tree, random forest, supported vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, and self-organized feature mapping (SOM). The performance comparison indicates that random forest is a good choice to balance the tradeoff of the precision rate and the recall rate, and in an acceptable time. The experimental result shows the proposed method without the knowledge of SMS content has a significant improvement in terms of precision rate and recall rate compared with the traditional method using the combination of key words and sending frequency used in most of existing networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7866183/,2016 IEEE First International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC),13-16 June 2016,ieeexplore

Transcription is typically performed using cloud-based servers or custom hardware, but those resources are not always amenable to space environments due to size, weight, power, and cost constraints. Therefore, it is important to determine the performance of and optimal conditions for running transcription on hardware that is feasible for deployment in a space application. This research investigates and evaluates the performance of the wav2vec2 speech transcription engine, the current state-of-the-art model for this domain with and without optimizations. The target hardware, the NVIDIA Xavier NX Jetson embedded GPU, was chosen for its modern GPU architecture and small form factor. In addition to examining the input scaling behavior, we evaluate the hyperparameters of the clustered attention optimization, and average power and energy for inference relative to the operating power mode of the device. The clustered attention model outperformed the improved-clustered model for large input sizes, but the wav2vec2 model without clustering performed better for small input sizes. The clustered model energy per inference (13.90 J) was less than energy per inference of the improved-cluster model (15.03 J) and the vanilla softmax model (15.85 J).

10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00937,Binary Graph Neural Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for representation learning on irregular data. As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph.

In network training, the sparse binary filter remains fixed and only needs to train convolution of 1×1 size.

Human eyes contain a rich source of idiosyncratic information which may be used for the recognition of an individual's identity. This article implements an innovative experiment and a new approach to processing human eye movements, ultimately aimed at biometric identification of individuals. In our experiment, the subjects observe special test visual stimuli, which are generated on the computer monitor screen. The eye movements are tracked in dynamics providing information for constructing a nonparametric nonlinear dynamic model (Volterra model) of a human's oculomotor system (OMS) in the form of multivariate transient functions. The implemented method treats eye trajectories as 2-D distributions of points on the “Coordinate-Time” plane. The efficiency of dynamic characteristics for personality identification is confirmed by examples of models built on the basis of data from real experiments. The resulting OMS models are a source of information for the selection of informative features, in the space of which the decisive rule of optimal identification of individuals is determined using machine learning methods.

Most existing detection approaches assume that labels can be made readily available, but it is unrealistic to acquire all labels instantaneously. As concept drift is often unpredictable, the deployed machine learning model is not always amenable to concept drift detection. In this paper, we propose the Born-Again Decision Boundary algorithm, which is a novel unsupervised concept drift detection method for inspecting a deployed black box model without labels. The proposed method builds an inspector model that recreates the decision boundaries from the deployed model using black-box rule extraction techniques. This model calculates the distance from the decision boundary to the data point and monitors a region of uncertainty in the input space. Our method removes the dependency on machine learning algorithms, which has hindered the existing methods in practical applications and can be widely applied regardless of the classification algorithm.

In order to implement such a system, this paper presents one solution for detecting an object located directly in front of the vehicle and estimating its distance. The solution is based on the use of camera and LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor fusion.

10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488865,Can You Fix My Neural Network? Real-Time Adaptive Waveform Synthesis for Resilient Wireless Signal Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Due to the sheer scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G, the wireless spectrum is becoming severely congested. For this reason, wireless devices will need to continuously adapt to current spectrum conditions by changing their communication parameters in real-time. Therefore, wireless signal classification (WSC) will become a compelling necessity to decode fast-changing signals from dynamic transmitters. Thanks to its capability of classifying complex phenomena without explicit mathematical modeling, deep learning (DL) has been demonstrated to be a key enabler of WSC. Although DL can achieve a very high accuracy under certain conditions, recent research has unveiled that the wireless channel can disrupt the features learned by the DL model during training, thus drastically reducing the classification performance in real-world live settings. Since retraining classifiers is cumbersome after deployment, existing work has leveraged the usage of carefully-tailored Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters that, when applied at the transmitter's side, can restore the features that are lost because of the the channel actions, i.e., waveform synthesis. However, these approaches compute FIRs using offline optimization strategies, which limits their efficacy in highly-dynamic channel settings. In this paper, we improve the state of the art by proposing Chares, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based framework for channel-resilient adaptive waveform synthesis. Chares adapts to new and unseen channel conditions by optimally computing through DRL the FIRs in real time. Chares is a DRL agent whose architecture is based upon the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3), which requires minimal feedback from the receiver and explores a continuous action space for best performance. Chares has been extensively evaluated on two well-known datasets with an extensive number of channels. We have also evaluated the real-time latency of Chares with an implementation on field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

Despite this limitation, the software has been developed in two phases including feature extraction studies in phase2 thus enhancing the prediction accuracies achieved in phase1(a primitive and draft software design). Also the other challenges are input and output parameters for the software are in analog format &amp; knowledge based (interpretation needs skill); the empirical data is predominantly dependent on physics of EBW such as geometry, material properties and software accuracy to be validated by real-time physical EBW experiments. The challenges have been overcome by ensuring precision in empirical data collection, assimilation and cleansing and also feature extraction studies indicated the relevance in selection of input parameters. The selection of machine learning algorithm is also based on the applicability of the selected algorithm to address all the above challenges endured. Also the experimental results validated the prediction accuracies achieved via the Phase2 developed software. Despite the challenges endured, the indigenously designed, developed and validated EBW predictor software can predict EBW machine parameters (beam current and focus current) without any need to weld a WTS and hence, the software developed aids in reduction of the total manufacturing cost and also the lead time involved in realisation of launch vehicles and spacecrafts for various ISRO missions have been substantially reduced with induction of this EBW Predictor software.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9689446/,"2021 2nd International Conference on Communication, Computing and Industry 4.0 (C2I4)",16-17 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

However, there is a lack of deep understanding of these devices' characteristics in the cyberspace. In this paper, we take a first step in this direction by investigating these accessible industrial devices on the Internet. Because of critical nature of industrial control systems, the detection of online ICS devices should be done in a real-time and non-intrusive manner. Thus, we first analyze 17 industrial protocols widely used in industrial control systems, and train a probability model through the learning algorithm to improve detection accuracy. Then, we discover online ICS devices in the IPv4 space while reducing the noise of industrial honeypots. To observe the dynamics of ICS devices in a relatively long run, we have deployed our discovery system on Amazon EC2 and detected online ICS devices in the whole IPv4 space for eight times from August 2015 to March 2016. Based on the ICS device data collection, we conduct a comprehensive data analysis to characterize the usage of ICS devices, especially in the answer to the following three questions: (1) what are the distribution features of ICS devices, (2) who use these ICS devices, and (3) what are the functions of these ICS devices.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7784407/,2016 IEEE 24th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP),8-11 Nov. 2016,ieeexplore

This new variant, named Chebyshev polynomial BLS (CPBLS), has a light structure with a reduction in computational complexity since the sparse autoencoder is removed. Instead, the dimension of each input sample is expended by n + 1 Chebyshev polynomials, mapping the original feature into a new feature space with higher dimension, which helps to classify the patterns in training. The proposed CPBLS is evaluated by some popular datasets from UCI and KEEL repositories, and it outperforms some representative neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models in terms of classification accuracy.

When the subjects try to control the external devices purely using brain signals without actual movements (brain control), they adjust the neural firing patterns to adapt to device control, which expands the state-action space for the RL decoder to explore. The challenge is to quickly explore the new knowledge in the sizeable state-action space and maintain good performance. Recently quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning (QAGKRL) was proposed to quickly explore the global optimum in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). However, its network size will grow large when the new input comes, which makes it computationally inefficient. In addition, the output is generated using the whole input structure without being sensitive to the new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new kernel based reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes the clustering technique in the input domain. The similar neural inputs are grouped, and a new input only activates its nearest cluster, which either utilizes an existing sub-network or forms a new one. In this way, we can build the sub-feature space instead of the global mapping to calculate the output, which transfers the old knowledge effectively and also consequently reduces the computational complexity. To evaluate our algorithm, we test on the synthetic spike data, where the subject's task mode switches between manual control and brain control. Compared with QAGKRL, the simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve a faster learning curve, less computational time, and more accuracy.

To demonstrate this, we employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the infrastructure and propose a novel framework, namely NANDS, to co-explore NAS space and NoC Design Search (NDS) space with the objective to maximize accuracy and throughput. Since two metrics are tightly coupled, we develop a multi-phase manager to guide NANDS to gradually converge to solutions with the best accuracy-throughput tradeoff. On top of it, we propose techniques to detect and alleviate timing performance bottleneck, which allows better and more efficient exploration of NDS space. Experimental results on common datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10, show that compared with state-of-the-art hardware-aware NAS, NANDS can achieve 42.99% higher throughput along with 1.58% accuracy improvement.

This paper is an informal introduction to the issues involved when designing the computing hardware and a real-time optimization algorithm at the same time, which can result in systems with efficiencies and performances that are unachievable when designing the sub-systems independently.

To enable these intelligence vehicles to acquire driving skills at a level comparable to that of human drivers, long short-term memory of previous self-driving processes is necessary, but is difficult to introduce into the above-mentioned frameworks. In this paper, we propose a model for self-driving cars called the cognitive map-based neural network (CMNN). Our framework consists of three parts: a convolutional neural network that can perceive the environment in the manner that the human visual cortex does, a cognitive map to describe the locations of objects in a complex traffic scene and the relationships among them, and a recurrent neural network to process long short-term memory from the cognitive map, which is updated in real time. The proposed model is built to simultaneously handle three tasks: i) detecting free space and lane boundaries, ii) estimating vehicle pose and obstacle distance, and iii) learning to plan and control based on the behaviors of a human driver. More significantly, our approach introduces external instructions during an end-to-end driving process.

To reach the described research objective we have developed a new approach to design a computer system. In our design approach we mapped the physical structure of a system to a multidimensional Cellular Automata Space (CAS). CAS collects data from sensors that are at the specific coordinates of cells and it is the substrata for energy, materials and information flow representation. Events and Actions in a CAS are described using Event Calculus and the flow of fluents is interpreted on the basis of Collision-based computing paradigm. Trajectories approaching a collision site represent input values, and trajectories of localizations traveling away from a collision site represent output values.

Our goal here is to map color pixel intensity values to the twelve basic color names: pink, purple, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, brown, white, grey, and black. We consider only twelve categories, because basic color names were found to be shared between languages. To do so, our method firstly uses the hue value of HSV color space to categorize colors into a predefined number of ranges. Then, we apply a nearest neighbor classification on RGB color space to get color names, where only training colors containing in the same range as testing colors will be considered.

QES was used in this paper as a means for communicating spatial expressions between pairs of agents. Four situations were proposed and implemented in order to address interactions between pairs of artificial agents and between an artificial agent and a human. Tests with human volunteers suggested that the human description of space in sectors agrees with the qualitative discretisation provided by QES.

Nonetheless, most of the existing works achieve high accuracy in synthetic data while performing unsatisfactorily in real-world datasets. On the other hand, though existing multi-view-based, volumetric-based, and point-based methods have achieved promising results, they still suffer from high computational complexity or low memory utilization efficiency. For example, the computational time and memory consumption of multi-view-based and volumetric-based methods increase at most cubically with the increasing of the input resolution, while half of the point-based methods's runtime is wasted due to their irregular memory access. To address these issues, we propose a novel method to fuse complementary CNNs, dubbed as Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Networks (MBCNN), which achieves the current state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. The underlying design of MBCNN is to utilize the point-based convolution as a local-feature branch and spherical convolution as a global-feature branch, to capture patterns in space and exploit the merit of the pointwise MLP, which is robust to the perturbation.

10.1109/AMFG.2003.1240833,Component-based LDA method for face recognition with one training sample,IEEE,Conferences,"Many face recognition algorithms/systems have been developed in the last decade and excellent performances are also reported when there is sufficient number of representative training samples. In many real-life applications, only one training sample is available. Under this situation, the performance of existing algorithms will be degraded dramatically or the formulation is incorrect, which in turn, the algorithm cannot be implemented. We propose a component-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method to solve the one training sample problem. The basic idea of the proposed method is to construct local facial feature component bunches by moving each local feature region in four directions. In this way, we not only generate more samples, but also consider the face detection localization error while training. After that, we employ a sub-space LDA method, which is tailor-made for small number of training samples, for the local feature projection to maximize the discrimination power. Finally, combining the contributions of each local feature draws the recognition decision. FERET database is used for evaluating the proposed method and results are encouraging.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1240833/,2003 IEEE International SOI Conference. Proceedings (Cat.

10.1109/DCC.2009.75,Compressed Kernel Perceptrons,IEEE,Conferences,"Kernel machines are a popular class of machine learning algorithms that achieve state of the art accuracies on many real-life classification problems. Kernel perceptrons are among the most popular online kernel machines that are known to achieve high-quality classification despite their simplicity. They are represented by a set of B prototype examples, called support vectors, and their associated weights. To obtain a classification, a new example is compared to the support vectors. Both space to store a prediction model and time to provide a single classification scale as O(B). A problem with kernel perceptrons is that on noisy data the number of support vectors tends to grow without bounds with the number of training examples. To reduce the strain at computational resources, budget kernel perceptrons have been developed by upper bounding the number of support vectors. In this work, we propose a new budget algorithm that upper bounds the number of bits needed to store kernel perceptron. Setting the bitlength constraint could facilitate development of hardware and software implementations of kernel perceptrons on resource-limited devices such as microcontrollers. The proposed compressed kernel perceptron algorithm decides on the optimal tradeoff between number of support vectors and their bit precision. The algorithm was evaluated on several benchmark data sets and the results indicate that it can train highly accurate classifiers even when the available memory budget is below 1Kbit. This promising result points to a possibility of implementing powerful learning algorithms even on the most resource-constrained computational devices.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4976459/,2009 Data Compression Conference,16-18 March 2009,ieeexplore

Color information is an important feature for many computer vision applications. Color name as a descriptor finds it's applications in many real-world tasks such as Color Blind assistance, image retrieval and scene understanding. Color naming in images is a challenging problem due to shadows, view angles, illumination conditions and surface reflections. Manual labelling of color names for real-world images in applications like search engines, fashion parsing and tracking is a tedious task and time consuming. The proposed systems for color naming automates the process and avoids human labelling. These methods are based on superpixels in the CIELAB color space. We trained Random Forests classifier with color-chip dataset for pixel-wise color naming and for image-wise color naming it is trained on weakly color labelled image dataset. Both models are tested on real-world images for color name judgments. Experimental results shows that color names learned through these proposed systems have advantages in terms of implementation costs, speed of execution and can be used in real-time applications with lowcost hardware.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8971326/,2019 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP),7-9 June 2019,ieeexplore

This has been recognized in the research community and multiple solutions based on supervised learning approach have been proposed in the recent literature. However, these approaches need significant amount of labeled training data for use in real-life projects. In this paper, we propose to use Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) to carry out concept-based classification of software defect reports. We compute the ""semantic similarity"" between the defect type labels and the defect report in a concept space spanned by Wikipedia articles and then, assign the defect type which has the highest similarity with the defect report. This approach helps us to circumvent the problem of dependence on labeled training data.

10.1109/RTSS52674.2021.00026,Concurrent Order Dispatch for Instant Delivery with Time-Constrained Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Instant delivery has developed rapidly in recent years and significantly changed the lifestyle of people due to its timeliness and convenience. In instant delivery, the order dispatch process is concurrent. Couriers take new orders continuously and deliver multiple orders in a delivery trip (i.e., a batch). The delivery time of orders in a batch is often overlapped and interlinked with each other. The pickup and delivery sequence of the existing orders in a batch changes dynamically due to time constraints and real-time overdue possibility (i.e., the rate of deliveries that are not finished in promised time). Most of existing order dispatch mechanisms are designed for independent order dispatch or concurrent delivery without strict time constraints, hence are incapable of handling real-time concurrent dispatch with strict time constraints in on-demand instant delivery. To address the challenge, we propose a Time-Constrained Actor- Critic Reinforcement learning based concurrent dispatch system called TCAC-Dispatch to enhance the long-term overall revenue and reduce the overdue rate. Specifically, we design a deep matching network (DMN) with a variable action space, which integrates the state embedding (including route behaviors encoding) and actions embedding features into a long-term matching value. Then the Actor-Critic model tackles the concurrent order dispatch problem considering strict time constraints and stochastic demand-supply in instant delivery. An estimated time-based action pruning module is designed to ensure time constraints guarantee and accelerate the training as well as dispatching processes. We evaluate the TCAC-Dispatch with one-month data involved with 36.48 million orders and 42,000 couriers collected from one of the largest instant delivery companies in China, i.e., Eleme. Empirical experiments are conducted on a data-driven emulator deployed on the development environment of Eleme and results show that our method achieves 22% of the increase in total revenue and reduces the overdue rate by 21.6%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9622337/,2021 IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS),7-10 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

ML has many potential applications in the space domain. Next generation space instruments are producing data at rates that exceed the capabilities of current spacecraft to store or transmit to ground stations. Deployment of ML algorithms onboard future spacecraft could perform processing of sensor data as it is gathered, reducing data volume and providing a dramatic increase in throughput of meaningful data. ML techniques may also be used to enhance the autonomy of space missions. However ML techniques have not yet been widely deployed in space environments, primarily due to limitations on the computational capabilities of spaceflight hardware. The need to verify that high-performance computational hardware can reliably operate in this environment delays the adoption of these technologies. Nevertheless, the availability of advanced processing capabilities onboard spacecraft is increasing. These platforms may not provide the processing power of terrestrial equivalents, but they do provide the resources necessary for deploying real-time execution of ML algorithms. In this paper, we present results exploring the implementation of ML techniques on computationally-constrained, high-reliability spacecraft hardware.

Autotune is built on a suite of derivative-free optimization methods, and utilizes multi-level parallelism in a distributed computing environment for automatically training, scoring, and selecting good models. Incorporation of multiple objectives and constraints in the model exploration and selection process provides the flexibility needed to satisfy trade-offs necessary in practical machine learning applications. Experimental results from standard multi-objective optimization benchmark problems show that Autotune is very efficient in capturing Pareto fronts.

Subspace clustering is challenging since the search for the relevant features of each cluster and the detection of the final clusters are circular dependent and should be solved simultaneously. In this paper, we point out that feature correlation and distance divergence are important to subspace clustering, but both have not been considered in previous works. Feature correlation groups correlated features independently thus helps to reduce the search space for the relevant features search problem. Distance divergence distinguishes distances on different dimensions and helps to find the final clusters accurately. We tackle the two problems with the aid of a small amount domain knowledge in the form of must-links and cannot-links. We then devise a semi-supervised subspace clustering algorithm CDCDD. CDCDD integrates our solutions of the feature correlation and distance divergence problems, and uses an adaptive dimension voting scheme, which is derived from a previous unsupervised subspace clustering algorithm FINDIT. Experimental results on both synthetic data sets and real data sets show that the proposed CDCDD algorithm outperforms FINDIT in terms of accuracy, and outperforms the other constraint based algorithm SCMINER in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5694017/,2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining,13-17 Dec. 2010,ieeexplore

This paper discusses the engineering of reliable agents via the integration of deep RL with constraint-based augmentation models to guide the RL agent towards safe behavior. Within the constraints set, the RL agent is free to adapt and explore, such that its effectiveness to solve the given problem is not hindered. However, once the RL agent leaves the space defined by the constraints, the outside models can provide guidance to still work reliably.

Specifically, we designed a reinforcement learning-based decision engine to search for model transformation strategies in response to a combined objective of model accuracy and computation latency.

However, due to the low presence probability and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually hard to predict ARBs within a project. In this paper, we study whether and how ARBs can be located through cross-project prediction. We propose a transfer learning based aging related bug prediction approach (TLAP), which takes advantage of transfer learning to reduce the distribution difference between training sets and testing sets while preserving their data variance. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the severe class imbalance, class imbalance learning is conducted on the transferred latent space.

To find the best configuration of variables to minimize costs and maximize efficiency are typically used engineering software as CAD, CAE and CAM. In this context, Machine Learning can be used to automate and improve this type of application. This despite, those searches not seldomly evoke unreliable areas and suggest risky solutions. Because of inaccuracies, volatility, unfeasibility, and specificities of real environments, the easy incorporation of cultural practices (i.e. normative, situational, domain and historic knowledge) and as well as the production of multiple acceptable solutions for a problem is always welcome, especially in Engineering.

10.1109/ADFSP.1998.685683,D-FANNS (dynamical functional artificial neural networks)-a new avenue for intelligent analog signal processing,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only given. Intelligent signal processing may be defined as the process of mapping a signal x into a binary vector or matrix y, so that y enables the detection, classification, or interpretation of an event present in x. (In the case of an interpretation in an appropriate language, y would represent a digitally coded relational structure.) We denote by f the input-output map of such an intelligent signal processing filter. In a number of applications, it is possible to naturally implement the nonlinear filter map f by an artificial neural network (ANN). We consider the case in which x is an analog signal (waveform) belonging to L2(I), where I is an appropriate interval of the real line R1 (i.e., L2(I) is the space of square integrable functions on I), and propose the realization of f by an artificial neural network in which the synaptic weight actions of the first layer are implemented by a filter bank. We call such a network a dynamical functional artificial neural network (D-FANN) to distinguish it from a conventional functional artificial neural network (FANN), where a synaptic weight action is implemented by a scalar product (integration) in L2(I), between the incoming waveform x and a ""distributed"" functional weight. Compared with conventional FANNs, D-FANNs permit simple and meaningful causal realizations of intelligent analog signal processors.

10.23919/SpliTech.2019.8783027,DANN: Digital Audio Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Neural networks have been widely used in computer audio to deal with many synthesis and processing parameters. Experiments have also led to direct synthesis of audio using dynamic neural networks that exhibit oscillating behaviour, as they are clocked at audio rates. There is clearly great potential in convolutional networks as they directly implement complex resonances enabling acoustic interaction. It thus transpires that many different neural network types were used for direct audio synthesis and processing. The proposed innovation extends a fully-connected network of computational cells to facilitate long feedback delays (needed for waveguides) intertwined with zero delays (needed for polynomials). Another improvement is the network computing algorithm that allows for randomisation of delays by adjusting the order of calculations. The DANN model is a specification for network of cells and links that allows direct translation from digital audio synthesis and processing schemes. Taking basic examples such as exponential decay, logistic chaos and biquad filter it transpires that there are exact DANN equivalents to these basic building blocks. It is therefore suggested that complex DANN schemes can reproduce myriad synthesis and processing techniques in a transparent fashion. As a matter of proving the concept a simple snare drum synthesizer is translated to a DANN scheme in order to explore the parameter space in this domain. Thanks to the large amount of training schemes there is great potential be found in training networks for velocity sensitive synthesis to include complex physical interaction sensors.

10.1145/3240765.3240801,DNNBuilder: an Automated Tool for Building High-Performance DNN Hardware Accelerators for FPGAs,IEEE,Conferences,"Building a high-performance FPGA accelerator for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often requires RTL programming, hardware verification, and precise resource allocation, all of which can be time-consuming and challenging to perform even for seasoned FPGA developers. To bridge the gap between fast DNN construction in software (e.g., Caffe, TensorFlow) and slow hardware implementation, we propose DNNBuilder for building high-performance DNN hardware accelerators on FPGAs automatically. Novel techniques are developed to meet the throughput and latency requirements for both cloud- and edge-devices. A number of novel techniques including high-quality RTL neural network components, a fine-grained layer-based pipeline architecture, and a column-based cache scheme are developed to boost throughput, reduce latency, and save FPGA on-chip memory. To address the limited resource challenge, we design an automatic design space exploration tool to generate optimized parallelism guidelines by considering external memory access bandwidth, data reuse behaviors, FPGA resource availability, and DNN complexity. DNNBuilder is demonstrated on four DNNs (Alexnet, ZF, VGG16, and YOLO) on two FPGAs (XC7Z045 and KU115) corresponding to the edge- and cloud-computing, respectively. The fine-grained layer-based pipeline architecture and the column-based cache scheme contribute to 7.7x and 43x reduction of the latency and BRAM utilization compared to conventional designs. We achieve the best performance (up to 5.15x faster) and efficiency (up to 5.88x more efficient) compared to published FPGA-based classification-oriented DNN accelerators for both edge and cloud computing cases. We reach 4218 GOPS for running object detection DNN which is the highest throughput reported to the best of our knowledge. DNNBuilder can provide millisecond-scale real-time performance for processing HD video input and deliver higher efficiency (up to 4.35x) than the GPU-based solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8587697/,2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD),5-8 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

This enables Transformer-based large Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to be efficiently executed on resource-constrained mobile devices and reconfigured (i.e., switching models for dynamic hardware conditions) at run-time. Such reconfigurability is the key to save energy for battery-powered mobile devices, which widely use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique for hardware reconfiguration to prolong battery life. In this work, we creatively explore a hybrid block-structured pruning (BP) and pattern pruning (PP) for Transformer-based models and first attempt to combine hardware and software reconfiguration to maximally save energy for battery-powered mobile devices. Specifically, RT<sup>3</sup> integrates two-level optimizations: First, it utilizes an efficient BP as the first-step compression for resource-constrained mobile devices; then, RT<sup>3</sup> heuristically generates a shrunken search space based on the first level optimization and searches multiple pattern sets with diverse sparsity for PP via reinforcement learning to support lightweight software reconfiguration, which corresponds to available frequency levels of DVFS (i.e., hardware reconfiguration). At run-time, RT<sup>3</sup> can switch the lightweight pattern sets within 45ms to guarantee the required real-time constraint at different frequency levels.

Unsupervised machine learning offers techniques to cluster and to partition trajectories, extract highly frequented routes and points of interest, predict object movement and identify anomalous behaviour. On the other hand, transponder and broadcast systems provide additional attributes of the tracked trajectories. These labels pave the way for numerous supervised machine learning methods.

Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning presents one of the most important Bayesian machine learning approaches based on a particularly effective method for placing a prior distribution over the space of functions. Decoding was performed using Gaussian processes model which gives an efficient method for Bayesian inference when the firing rates and hand kinematics are nonlinear. Gaussian processes provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in noisy measurements. In off-line experiments, the Gaussian processes model reconstructions of hand trajectory were more accurate than previously reported results.

A main hindering factor for UGV navigation is the limited range of the on-board sensors that process only restricted areas of the environment at a time.

This restrains the exploration capability of the UGV especially in time-critical applications such as search and rescue.

Two major difficulties in such systems are the arbitrary source permutation and unknown number of sources in the mixture. We propose a novel deep learning framework for single channel speech separation by creating attractor points in high dimensional embedding space of the acoustic signals which pull together the time-frequency bins corresponding to each source. Attractor points in this study are created by finding the centroids of the sources in the embedding space, which are subsequently used to determine the similarity of each bin in the mixture to each source. The network is then trained to minimize the reconstruction error of each source by optimizing the embeddings. The proposed model is different from prior works in that it implements an end-to-end training, and it does not depend on the number of sources in the mixture. Two strategies are explored in the test time, K-means and fixed attractor points, where the latter requires no post-processing and can be implemented in real-time.

The CPS research community has been developing a large set of check blocks that can be integrated within the control loop to check signals against various types of attacks (e.g., false data injection attacks). Unfortunately, it is not possible to integrate all these “checks” within the control loop as the overhead introduced when checking signals may violate the delay constraints of the control loop. Moreover, these blocks do not completely operate in isolation of each other as dependencies exist among them in terms of their effectiveness against detecting a subset of attacks. Thus, it becomes a challenging and complex problem to assign the proper checks, especially with the presence of a rational adversary who can observe the check blocks assigned and optimizes her own attack strategies accordingly. This paper tackles the inherent state-action space explosion that arises in securing CPS through developing DeepBLOC (DB)-a framework in which Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms are utilized to provide optimal/sub-optimal assignments of check blocks to signals. The framework models stochastic games between the adversary and the CPS defender and derives mixed strategies for assigning check blocks to ensure the integrity of the propagated signals while abiding to the real-time constraints dictated by the control loop.

In this paper, we proposed a method to build a new kind of syn-agent which uses the TCP header reserved flag bits to notify the server a complete three-way TCP handshake. First the syn-agent instead of the real server answer the client with ACK after received a SYN packet from the client. Then if it is a syn-attack, there should be no further ACKs after this. After a given short period, the half-open TCP sock should be deleted from the agent. If it is a really connection request, after the third time handshake packet arrived, the agent set the reserved bit in the TCP header to be ‘1’ and route the packet to the real server. When the server received a packet with the reserved bits set to be ‘1’, it directly allocates memory for the connection and begins to communicate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4620589/,2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics,12-15 July 2008,ieeexplore
10.1109/AHS.2018.8541460,Delay Tolerant Network Routing as a Machine Learning Classification Problem,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper discusses a machine learning-based approach to routing for delay tolerant networks (DTNs) [1]. DTNs are networks which experience frequent disconnections between nodes, uncertainty of an end-to-end path, long one-way trip times, and may have high error rates and asymmetric links. Such networks exist in deep space satellite networks, very rural environments, disaster areas and underwater environments. In this work, we use machine learning classifiers to predict a set of neighboring nodes which are the most likely to deliver a message to a desired location based on message history delivery information. We use the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) [2] to emulate the DTN environment based on real-world location traces and collect network traffic statistics from the Bundle Protocol implementation IBR-DTN [3].

High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) can satisfy these requirements offering high bandwidth, low power and high-integration capacity features. However, it remains unclear whether the predictability and isolation properties of HBM are compatible with the requirements of critical embedded systems.

10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487691,Denoising auto-encoders for learning of objects and tools affordances in continuous space,IEEE,Conferences,"The concept of affordances facilitates the encoding of relations between actions and effects in an environment centered around the agent. Such an interpretation has important impacts on several cognitive capabilities and manifestations of intelligence, such as prediction and planning. In this paper, a new framework based on denoising Auto-encoders (dA) is proposed which allows an agent to explore its environment and actively learn the affordances of objects and tools by observing the consequences of acting on them. The dA serves as a unified framework to fuse multi-modal data and retrieve an entire missing modality or a feature within a modality given information about other modalities. This work has two major contributions. First, since training the dA is done in continuous space, there will be no need to discretize the dataset and higher accuracies in inference can be achieved with respect to approaches in which data discretization is required (e.g. Bayesian networks). Second, by fixing the structure of the dA, knowledge can be added incrementally making the architecture particularly useful in online learning scenarios.

Today, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) present the highest accuracy for the disparity map estimation [1]. However, CNNs require considerable computing capacity to process billions of floating-point operations in a real-time fashion. Besides, commercial stereo cameras produce huge size images (e.g., 10 Megapixels [2]), which impose a new computational cost to the system. The problem will be pronounced if we target resource-limited hardware for the implementation. In this paper, we propose DenseDisp, an automatic framework that designs a Siamese neural architecture for disparity map estimation in a reasonable time. DenseDisp leverages a meta-heuristic multi-objective exploration to discover hardware-friendly architectures by considering accuracy and network FLOPS as the optimization objectives. We explore the design space with four different fitness functions to improve the accuracy-FLOPS trade-off and convergency time of the DenseDisp.

Optimization of the growth rate via analytical and standard numerical techniques is intractable because of the high dimensionality of the design space and the existence of many local optima. Instead, the growth rate is optimized using a real-value evolutionary algorithm (EA), which performs mutation, selection, and recombination on a population of candidate design parameters. Practical application of EAs requires the availability of a computationally efficient model of design quality. Two models of the RKO are developed relating the growth rate of the microwave output power to the design parameters. Both models have computationally efficient implementations, and one of them generalizes easily to a novel multi-cavity class of RKO devices, which has significantly better growth rates than standard two-cavity RKOs. Many design optimization problems of interest involve physical constraints. The GENOCOP evolutionary algorithm includes features which support the incorporation of physical constraints in the problem specification through the maintenance of separate search and reference populations, where the latter consists entirely of feasible individuals. It provides ""blind"" operators to recombine individuals from the two populations to produce new reference population individuals. However, the use of these blind operators can result in unnecessary modification of the search individual, and domain specific recombination operators can result in improved effectiveness. As with any optimization technique, GENOCOP also allows the use of either the penalty function or repair method for evaluation of infeasible individuals.

10.1109/SAINT.2012.14,Detecting Malicious Websites by Learning IP Address Features,IEEE,Conferences,"Web-based malware attacks have become one of the most serious threats that need to be addressed urgently. Several approaches that have attracted attention as promising ways of detecting such malware include employing various blacklists. However, these conventional approaches often fail to detect new attacks owing to the versatility of malicious websites. Thus, it is difficult to maintain up-to-date blacklists with information regarding new malicious websites. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method for detecting malicious websites using the characteristics of IP addresses. Our approach leverages the empirical observation that IP addresses are more stable than other metrics such as URL and DNS. While the strings that form URLs or domain names are highly variable, IP addresses are less variable, i.e., IPv4 address space is mapped onto 4-bytes strings. We develop a lightweight and scalable detection scheme based on the machine learning technique. The aim of this study is not to provide a single solution that effectively detects web-based malware but to develop a technique that compensates the drawbacks of existing approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using real IP address data from existing blacklists and real traffic data on a campus network.

We propose to exploits the physical plant state information to enhance both reliability and security. Our approach, which monitors the controlled plant state trajectory, allows for tunable fault-tolerance as well as detection of malicious attacks, and it achieves these at a low overhead. The plant state space consists of safe and marginal state subspaces. In the safe subspace the CPS will continue its safe operation even if the worst case control signal is applied. In contrast, any erroneous control applied when the plant state is marginal, may lead to a catastrophic system failure. Such an erroneous control output may be due to either a benign fault or a malicious security attack. As most of the time the plant will be deep within its safe subspace, we can avoid using expensive redundancy techniques and thus, reduce the computational load while still guaranteeing safe operation. When a marginal state of the plant is detected, it will signal the potential presence of a “natural” fault or malicious attack. Our scheme will counter this by switching to a critical mode involving higher levels of redundancy to combat natural failures as well as alternative mechanisms to defeat malicious attacks. A major challenge in our approach is to determine, in real-time, whether the current state of the physical plant is deep within its safe sub-space or is marginal. We have used various machine learning techniques for classifying the state and our results indicate that with a reasonable number of entries in a lookup table and with a short execution time, the required classification can be performed efficiently.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8405951/,2018 7th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO),10-14 June 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/LCN.2008.4664303,Detection of anomalous network packets using lightweight stateless payload inspection,IEEE,Conferences,"A real-time packet-level anomaly detection approach for high-speed network intrusion prevention is described. The approach is suitable for small and fast hardware implementation and was designed to be embedded in network appliances. Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate.

Information about dangerous points (hazards) on roads is important for bicycle-riding safety. We proposed a method to detect road hazards using sensors attached to a bicycle in a prior conventional study. The conventional approach needs training data for machine learning, requiring the bicycle to travel over hazardous areas repeatedly. Not only is this is dangerous, it is also difficult to collect sufficiently large amounts of data. A bicycle simulator is a potential solution to this problem. Commercial bicycle simulators have been developed in Japan. However, the bicycle body is fixed, thus making the ride feel unnatural. This type of bicycle simulator is not suitable for gathering hazard data. We therefore propose a bicycle simulator capable of tilt angle control that runs in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual space. The built-in sensors send the speed and front-wheel angle information to the control unit. A new tilt angle is then calculated by the control unit and the information is sent to an AC servomotor to achieve this new tilt angle. Simultaneously, a 3D view of a virtual course is generated using the calculated results. By using our previously proposed rotation center tracking method, left and right steering actions can be observed by the system. This system allows for dangerous situations to be easily and repeatedly created with no danger to the rider.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8377866/,2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC),23-27 July 2018,ieeexplore

The novelty of this work is the introduction of probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to characterize the uncertain boundaries of each state. The 3D gestures are modeled as a sequence of states in a configuration space; the number of states and their spatial parameters are calculated by dynamic k-means clustering on the training data of the gesture without temporal information. Gesture recognition is performed using a simple Finite State Machine (FSM), where, each state transition depends only on the output of its corresponding PNN and optionally on its time restrictions (minimum and maximum time permitted in the state). If a recognizer reaches its final state, then it could be said that a gesture is recognized.

Unsupervised learning in training neural networks is a method, where network classification rules are self developed and which does not require any knowledge about the desired output. Only input data is presented to the ANN in the learning process of the network, in other words the input space of the unsupervised learning ANN is the diffusion tensor eigenvector data of each imaging matrix. The network then adjusts the weightings to determine patterns having similar characteristics and classification is done in that way. The resulting classification represents the principal diffusion direction and the weighted diffusion distribution tracked by the fibers. Verification of the application on synthetic data enabled the implementation of the method on real brain images. The aim of the proposed method is to accomplish brain fiber tracking based on learning algorithms according to the modeling studies accepted in artificial neural network literature.

The manifold is represented as a parametrized surface represented by a set of parameters that are defined on the input samples. The representation also provides a natural mapping from high to low dimensional space, and a concatenation of these two mappings induces a projection operator onto the manifold. The explicit projection operator allows for a clearly defined objective function in terms of projection distance and reconstruction error. A formulation of the mappings in terms of kernel regression permits a direct optimization of the objective function and the extremal points converge to principal surfaces as the number of data to learn from increases.

10.1109/3DIM.2005.33,Discrete pose space estimation to improve ICP-based tracking,IEEE,Conferences,"Iterative closest point (ICP)-based tracking works well when the interframe motion is within the ICP minimum well space. For large interframe motions resulting from a limited sensor acquisition rate relative to the speed of the object motion, it suffers from slow convergence and a tendency to be stalled by local minima. A novel method is proposed to improve the performance of ICP-based tracking. The method is based upon the bounded Hough transform (BHT) which estimates the object pose in a coarse discrete pose space. Given an initial pose estimate, and assuming that the interframe motion is bounded in all 6 pose dimensions, the BHT estimates the current frame's pose. On its own, the BHT is able to track an object's pose in sparse range data both efficiently and reliably, albeit with a limited precision. Experiments on both simulated and real data show the BHT to be more efficient than a number of variants of the ICP for a similar degree of reliability. A hybrid method has also been implemented wherein at each frame the BHT is followed by a few ICP iterations. This hybrid method is more efficient than the ICP, and is more reliable than either the BHT or ICP separately.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1443287/,Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05),13-16 June 2005,ieeexplore

The overall observation state probability is then computed as an aggregation of the partial probabilities and their objective relevance weights based on a linear combination. The minimum classification error (MCE) objective based on the gradient probabilistic descent (GPD) optimization algorithm is reformulated to derive the update equations for the relevance weights and the partial state probabilities.

10.1109/ICSE.2019.00112,Distance-Based Sampling of Software Configuration Spaces,IEEE,Conferences,"Configurable software systems provide a multitude of configuration options to adjust and optimize their functional and non-functional properties. For instance, to find the fastest configuration for a given setting, a brute-force strategy measures the performance of all configurations, which is typically intractable. Addressing this challenge, state-of-the-art strategies rely on machine learning, analyzing only a few configurations (i.e., a sample set) to predict the performance of other configurations. However, to obtain accurate performance predictions, a representative sample set of configurations is required. Addressing this task, different sampling strategies have been proposed, which come with different advantages (e.g., covering the configuration space systematically) and disadvantages (e.g., the need to enumerate all configurations). In our experiments, we found that most sampling strategies do not achieve a good coverage of the configuration space with respect to covering relevant performance values. That is, they miss important configurations with distinct performance behavior. Based on this observation, we devise a new sampling strategy, called distance-based sampling, that is based on a distance metric and a probability distribution to spread the configurations of the sample set according to a given probability distribution across the configuration space. This way, we cover different kinds of interactions among configuration options in the sample set. To demonstrate the merits of distance-based sampling, we compare it to state-of-the-art sampling strategies, such as t-wise sampling, on 10 real-world configurable software systems.

While using online services any mobile device can suffice for an accurate identification, in the offline scenario, implemented on a wearable mobile hardware, it is difficult to achieve both real-time responsiveness and high accuracy. In this paper we present a solution to replace a large open source face recognizer network (provided as part of the dlib libraries), distilling its learned knowledge into a less demanding CNN. The former is used as an expert oracle that provides the targets, while the latter is trained on the same input image, following a regression approach. In addition to lightness, our CNN is trained to use smaller input images, naturally allowing the recognition of identities in a wider distance range and with a reduced amount of computation. This eventually permits the porting of the network into a dedicated mobile accelerating hardware. The hypothesis we want to demonstrate is that since the feature space topology has been deeply explored during the training of the expert network, and due to the fact that no information is created during the up sampling of a tiny face to the input size of the expert oracle, the smaller network can provide the same accuracy at a reduced computational cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8756937/,"2019 42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)",20-24 May 2019,ieeexplore

Thanks to the increasing availability of high-quality data and the success of deep learning algorithms, machine learning (ML)-based detection and classification have been increasingly effective and adopted against sophisticated attacks. However, many of these techniques rely on the assumptions that the training and testing datasets share the same distribution and the same class labels in a stationary environment. As such assumptions may fail to hold when the system dynamics shift and new threat variants emerge in a non-stationary environment, the capability of trained ML models to adapt in complex operating scenarios will be critical to their deployment in real-world smart grid communications. To this aim, this paper proposes a domain-adversarial transfer learning framework for robust intrusion detection against smart grid attacks.

10.1109/SCCC.2001.972633,Domain-dependent option policies in autonomous robot learning,IEEE,Conferences,"In control-related applications such as robotics, determination of optimal solutions is made very difficult for many reasons. Among these stands the difficulty in finding out an appropriate model of the domain, as defined by the control agent (robot), environment where it acts and their interaction. Reinforcement learning is a theory which defines a collection of algorithms for determination of control actions under model-free assumptions, which allows control agents to learn optimal actions in an autonomous way. In reinforcement learning, a cost functional to be optimised is determined in advance. The agent then learns how to perform this optimisation via trial and error on its environment. A trial corresponds to execution of actions chosen by the agent, and the error is the immediate result (a real-valued reinforcement) of this action. In the work reported, we consider trials by a learning robotic agent which are not based on low level actions, but instead on sequences of actions (options or macro-operators). We analysed the performance both in terms of learning speed and quality of learned control-for options that correspond to mappings from states to action policies (O/sub /spl Pi// options). Experimental results show that careful (domain-dependent) selection of options (via methods such as discretised potential fields) produce much faster learning for option-based robots when compared to their action-based counterparts. Of critical importance, however, is the option mapping in regions of the state space where the options are not assumed to be necessary: as performance of reinforcement learning algorithms is strongly dependent on sufficient exploration of the state space, even in such regions a careful, ad-hoc selection of actions is of foremost importance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/972633/,SCCC 2001. 21st International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society,9-9 Nov. 2001,ieeexplore

In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we first extract a set of features from the Android applications (apps) and represent them as binary feature vectors; with these inputs, we then explore the security of a generic learning-based classifier for Android malware detection in the presence of adversaries. To harden the evasion, we first present count featurization to transform the binary feature space into continuous probabilities encoding the distribution in each class (either benign or malicious). To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further introduce softmax function with adversarial parameter to find the best trade-off between security and accuracy for the classifier. Accordingly, we develop a system named DroidEye which integrates our proposed method for Android malware detection.

Dynamic reconfiguration in such platforms can help in run-time optimization to meet the design goals. The required optimal platform configuration can be achieved by a flexible design space exploration and appropriate task partitioning obtained through profiling computation and communication of processes in application code. This paper focuses on profiling, it being the key to the success of obtaining optimal platform configurations. It points to existing profiling techniques, their pros and cons vis-à-vis dynamic reconfigurable architectures, and the challenges in their design for obtaining optimal profiling performance.

This paper studies the benefits of random linear network coding to exploit multiple commercially available cloud storage providers simultaneously with the possibility to constantly adapt to changing cloud performance in order to optimize data retrieval times. The main contribution of this paper is a new data distribution mechanisms that cleverly stores and moves data among different clouds in order to optimize performance. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-offs among storage space, reliability and data retrieval speed for our proposed scheme.

Such multiple datasets need to be fused together in some ways for further analysis. Data fusion at feature level requires domain knowledge and can be time-consuming and ineffective, but it could be avoided if decision-level fusion is applied properly. Ensemble methods appear to be an appropriate paradigm to do just that as each subset of heterogeneous data sources can be separately used to induce models independently and their decisions are then aggregated by a decision fusion function in an ensemble. This study investigates how heterogeneous data can be used to generate more diverse classifiers to build more accurate ensembles. A Dynamic Ensemble Selection Optimisation (DESO) framework is proposed, using the local feature space of heterogeneous data to increase diversity among classifiers and Simulated Annealing for optimisation. An implementation example of DESO - BaggingDES is provided with Bagging as a base platform of DESO, to test its performance and also explore the relationship between diversity and accuracy. Experiments are carried out with some heterogeneous datasets derived from real-world benchmark datasets.

Accurate visual registration between real and computer-generated objects in combined images is critically important for conveying the perception that both types of object occupy the same 3-dimensional (3D) space. To date, augmented-reality systems have concentrated on simply improving 3D coordinate system registration in order to improve apparent (image) registration error. This paper introduces the idea of dynamically measuring registration error in combined images (2D error) and using that information to correct 3D coordinate system registration error which in turn improves registration in the combined images. Registration can be made exact in every combined image if a small video delay can be tolerated. Our experimental augmented-reality system achieves improved image registration, stability, and error tolerance from tracking system drift and jitter over current augmented-reality systems. No additional tracking hardware or other devices are needed on the user's head-mounted display. Computer-generated objects can be ""nailed"" to real-world reference points in every image the user sees with an easily-implemented algorithm.

10.1109/CSNet47905.2019.9108976,Dynamic security management driven by situations: An exploratory analysis of logs for the identification of security situations,IEEE,Conferences,"Situation awareness consists of ""the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future"". Being aware of the security situation is then mandatory to launch proper security reactions in response to cybersecurity attacks. Security Incident and Event Management solutions are deployed within Security Operation Centers. Some vendors propose machine learning based approaches to detect intrusions by analysing networks behaviours. But cyberattacks like Wannacry and NotPetya, which shut down hundreds of thousands of computers, demonstrated that networks monitoring and surveillance solutions remain insufficient. Detecting these complex attacks (a.k.a. Advanced Persistent Threats) requires security administrators to retain a large number of logs just in case problems are detected and involve the investigation of past security events. This approach generates massive data that have to be analysed at the right time in order to detect any accidental or caused incident. In the same time, security administrators are not yet seasoned to such a task and lack the desired skills in data science. As a consequence, a large amount of data is available and still remains unexplored which leaves number of indicators of compromise under the radar. Building on the concept of situation awareness, we developed a situation-driven framework, called dynSMAUG, for dynamic security management. This approach simplifies the security management of dynamic systems and allows the specification of security policies at a high-level of abstraction (close to security requirements). This invited paper aims at exposing real security situations elicitation, coming from networks security experts, and showing the results of exploratory analysis techniques using complex event processing techniques to identify and extract security situations from a large volume of logs.

A dynamic navigation mesh can represent the traversable space of such environments. The A* algorithm computes optimal paths through the dual graph of this mesh. When an obstacle is inserted or deleted, the mesh changes and agents should re-plan their paths. Many existing re-planning algorithms are too memory-intensive for crowds, or they cannot easily be used on graphs where vertices and edges are added or removed. In this paper, we present Dynamically Pruned A* (DPA*), an extension of A* for re-planning optimal paths in dynamic navigation meshes. DPA* has similarities to adaptive algorithms that make the A* heuristic more informed based on previous queries. However, DPA* prunes the search using only the previous path and its relation to the dynamic event. We describe the four re-planning scenarios that can occur; DPA* uses different rules in each scenario. Our algorithm is memory-friendly and robust against structural changes in the graph, which makes it suitable for crowds in dynamic navigation meshes. Experiments show that DPA* performs particularly well in complex environments and when the dynamic event is visible to the agent.

This paper presents the design and implementation of an industrial wireless camera system, namely, EFCam, which uses low-power wireless communications and edge-fog computing to achieve cordless and energy-efficient visual sensing. The camera performs image pre-processing (i.e., compression or feature extraction) and transmits the data to a resourceful fog node for advanced processing using deep models. EFCam admits dynamic configurations of several parameters that form a configuration space. It aims to adapt the configuration to maintain desired visual sensing performance of the deep model at the fog node with minimum energy consumption of the camera in image capture, pre-processing, and data communications, under dynamic variations of application requirement and wireless channel conditions. However, the adaptation is challenging due primarily to the complex relationships among the involved factors. To address the complexity, we apply deep reinforcement learning to learn the optimal adaptation policy.

We designed a low cost tool, called EMI Spy, and a software environment for rapid deployment and evaluation of ambient EMI-based interactive infrastructure. EMI Spy captures electromagnetic interference and delivers the signal to a user's mobile device or PC through either the device's wired audio input or wirelessly using Bluetooth. The wireless version can be worn on the wrist, communicating with the user;s mobile device in their pocket. Users are able to train the system in less than 1 second to uniquely identify displays in a 2-m radius around them, as well as to detect pointing at a distance and touching gestures on the displays in real-time. The combination of a low cost EMI logger and an open source machine learning tool kit allows developers to quickly prototype proxemic, touch-to-connect, and gestural interaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of mobile, EMI-based device and gesture recognition with preliminary user studies in 3 scenarios, achieving 96% classification accuracy at close range for 6 digital signage displays distributed throughout a building, and 90% accuracy in classifying pointing gestures at neighboring desktop LCD displays. We were able to distinguish 1- and 2-finger touching with perfect accuracy and show indications of a way to determine power consumption of a device via touch.

10.1109/IPCCC50635.2020.9391551,Efficient Architecture Paradigm for Deep Learning Inference as a Service,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep learning (DL) inference has been broadly used and shown excellent performance in many intelligent applications. Unfortunately, the high resource consumption and training efforts of sophisticated models present obstacles for regular users to enjoy it. Thus, Deep Learning Inference as a Service (DIaaS), offering online inference services on cloud, has earned great popularity among cloud tenants who can send their DIaaS inputs via RPCs across the internal network. However, such detached architecture paradigm is inappropriate to DIaaS because the high-dimensional inputs of DIaaS consume a lot of precious internal bandwidth and the service latency of DIaaS has to be low and stable. We therefore propose a novel architecture paradigm on cloud for DIaaS in order to address the above two problems without giving up the security and maintenance benefits. We first leverage the SGX technology, a strongly-protected user space enclave, to bring DIaaS computation to its input source as close as possible, i.e. co-locating a cloud tenant and its subscribed DIaaS in the same virtual machine. When the GPU acceleration is needed, we migrate this virtual machine to any available GPU host and transparently utilize the GPU via our backend computing stack installed on it. In this way the majority of internal bandwidth is saved compared to traditional paradigm. Furthermore, we greatly improve the efficiency of the proposed architecture paradigm, from the computation and I/O perspectives, by making the entire data flow more DL-oriented. Finally, we implement a prototype system and evaluate it in real-world scenarios. The experiments show that our locality-aware architecture achieves the average single CPU (GPU) based deep learning inference time 2.84X (4.87X) less than the traditional detached architecture on average.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9391551/,2020 IEEE 39th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC),6-8 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can cause fateful consequences in real-world face recognition applications with security-sensitive purposes. Adversarial attacks are widely studied as they can identify the vulnerability of the models before they are deployed. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art face recognition models in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but can only acquire hard-label predictions by sending queries to the target model. This attack setting is more practical in real-world face recognition systems. To improve the efficiency of previous methods, we propose an evolutionary attack algorithm, which can model the local geometry of the search directions and reduce the dimension of the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that induces a minimum perturbation to an input face image with fewer queries.

As an alternative, link-signature-based (LSB) secret key extraction techniques have received many interests in recent years. It is believed that these mechanisms are secure, based on the fundamental assumption that wireless signals received at two locations separated by more than half a wavelength apart are uncorrelated. However, recently it has been observed that in some circumstances this assumption does not hold, rendering LSB key extraction mechanisms vulnerable to attacks. This paper studies empirical statistical inference attacks (SIA) to LSB key extraction, whereby an attacker infers the signature of a target link, and henceforce recovers the secret key extracted from that signature, by observing the surrounding links. Different from prior work that assumes a theoretical link-correlation model for the inference, our study does not make any assumption on link correlation. Instead, ours is taking a machine learning method for link inference based on empirically measured link data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are developed to launch SIA under various realistic scenarios. Our experiment results show that even without making assumptions on link correlation, the proposed inference algorithms are still quite effective, and can reduce the key search space by many orders of magnitudes compared to brutal force search.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8170755/,MILCOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM),23-25 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

But word vectors cannot obtain the global knowledge of an image category sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a new encyclopedia enhanced semantic embedding model to promote the discriminative capability of word vector prototypes with the global knowledge of each image category. The proposed model extracts the TF-IDF key words from encyclopedia articles to acquire the global knowledge of each category. The convex combination of the key words' word vectors acts as the prototypes of the object categories. The prototypes of seen and unseen classes build up the embedding space where the nearest neighbour search is implemented to recognize the unseen images. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging ImageNet Fall 2011 1k2hop dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8296489/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),17-20 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

To benefit from the joint training, we introducea divergence-based clustering objective that not only encourages the separation and compactness of the clusters but also enjoy a clear cluster structure by embedding the simplex geometry of the output space into the loss. The proposed network consists of modality-specific feature learning, modality fusion and cluster assignment three modules.

MLNs are a state-of-the-art representation formalism that integrates first-order logic and probability. Learning MLNs structure is hard due to the combinatorial space of candidates caused by the expressive power of first-order logic. We present current work on the development of algorithms for learning MLNs, based on the Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic. Experiments in real-world domains show that the proposed approach improves accuracy and learning time over the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, MAP and conditional inference in MLNs are hard computational tasks too. This paper presents two algorithms for these tasks based on the Iterated Robust Tabu Search (IRoTS) schema. The first algorithm performs MAP inference by performing a RoTS search within a ILS iteration. Extensive experiments show that it improves over the state-of the-art algorithm in terms of solution quality and inference times. The second algorithm combines IRoTS with simulated annealing for conditional inference and we show through experiments that it is faster than the current state-of-the-art algorithm maintaining the same inference quality.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5989060/,"2011 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems",30 June-2 July 2011,ieeexplore

A linear index structure based on the D-tree is used to support location dependent queries, which is reduced to planar point queries. In this paper, we propose a modified D-tree index structure for processing location dependent information focusing on window queries via wireless data broadcast in a mobile environment. Hilbert curve is used to reduce the data regions that have to be searched from the whole space. Filtering mechanisms are used to find the real answer set.

This scenario is challenging for data mining techniques which are not arrogated to the new space and time requirements. In many of the real world applications, classification of imbalanced data-sets is the point of attraction. Most of the classification methods focused on two-class imbalanced problem. So, it is necessary to solve multi-class imbalanced problem, which exist in real-world domains. In the proposed work, we introduced a methodology for classification of multi-class imbalanced data. This methodology consists of two steps: In first step we used Binarization techniques (OVA and OVO) for decomposing original dataset into subsets of binary classes. In second step, the SMOTE algorithm is applied against each subset of imbalanced binary class in order to get balanced data. Finally, to achieve classification goal Random Forest (RF) classifier is used. Specifically, oversampling technique is adapted to big data using MapReduce so that this technique is able to handle as large data-set as needed.

Practically, this method estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher dimensional space where they are linear. Efficient Model Predictive Control methods can then be applied to the lifted model.

In principle, the detection process seeks to simultaneously maximize clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimize the clustering drift between two successive time steps. Several evolutionary clustering methods have been developed in an attempt to find the best trade-off between clustering accuracy and temporal smoothness, but the classic genetic operators in these methods do not make the best of the inter- and intra-connected relationships between nodes, which limits their effectiveness. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel migration operator to work in tandem with classic genetic operators to improve the discovery of evolving community structures. The operator is implemented within an existing genetic algorithm which relies on a genome representation under a decomposition framework that formulates evolutionary community detection as a multiobjective optimization problem. Moreover, we present a new method of calculating modularity directly from a genome matrix as the objective for measuring the snapshot quality, which results in a wider search space for finding the optimal solution. Experimental results over several synthetic networks and one real-world dynamic social network suggest that our method is superior to two other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and smoothness in discovering evolving community structures in dynamic social networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8852006/,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 July 2019,ieeexplore

Such autonomous mobile robots can be incorporated into a variety of applications, ranging from logistics and maintenance, to intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). One such example is that of a tele-operator using the robot to generate a map of the inside of a building while discovering and tagging the objects of interest. During this process, the tele-operator can also assign an area for the robot to navigate autonomously or return to a previously marked area/object of interest. Search and rescue and ISR abilities could be immensely improved with such capabilities. The goal of this research is to prototype and demonstrate the above autonomous capabilities in a mobile ground robot called Explorer51. Objectives include: (i) enabling an operator to drive the robot non-line of sight to explore a space by incorporating a first-person view (FPV) system to stream data from the robot to the base station; (ii) implementing automatic collision avoidance to prevent the operator from running the robot into obstacles; (iii) creating and saving 2D and 3D maps of the space in real time by using a 2D laser scanner, tracking, and depth/RGB cameras; (iv) locating and tagging objects of interest as waypoints within the map; (v) autonomously navigate within the map to reach a chosen waypoint.To accomplish these goals, we are using the AION Robotics R1 Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) rover as the platform for Explorer51 to demonstrate the autonomous features.

It is an important activity for data preprocessing used in software quality modeling and other data mining problems. Feature selection algorithms can be divided into two categories, feature ranking and feature subset selection. Feature ranking orders the features by a criterion and a user selects some of the features that are appropriate for a given scenario. Feature subset selection techniques search the space of possible feature subsets and evaluate the suitability of each. This paper investigates performance metric based feature ranking techniques by using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) learner with nine different performance metrics. The nine performance metrics include overall accuracy (OA), default F-measure (DFM), default geometric mean (DGM), default arithmetic mean (DAM), area under ROC (AUC), area under PRC (PRC), best F-measure (BFM), best geometric mean (BGM) and best arithmetic mean (BAM). The goal of the paper is to study the effect of the different performance metrics on the feature ranking results, which in turn influences the classification performance. We assessed the performance of the classification models constructed on those selected feature subsets through an empirical case study that was carried out on six data sets of real-world software systems. The results demonstrate that AUC, PRC, BFM, BGM and BAM as performance metrics for feature ranking outperformed the other performance metrics, OA, DFM, DGMand DAM, unanimously across all the data sets and therefore are recommended based on this study.

In this work, we first implement SpArSe and modify it to reduce search time, obtaining similar results regarding accuracy, model size, and maximum working memory but in less optimization time. Moreover, we extend the search space to include recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and add an inference latency objective for time-constrained tasks. Finally, we test our implementation in a gesture recognition task obtaining better results than previous manually tuned approaches for size and performance metrics, which validates the approach and its utility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9356164/,2020 19th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),14-17 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/SOCA.2009.5410453,Extending service model to build an effective service composition framework for cyber-physical systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are combinations of physical entities controlled by software systems to accomplish specified tasks under stringent real-time and physical entity constraints. As more and more physical entities are equipped with embedded computers, they are becoming more and more intelligent. However, the problem of effectively composing the services provided by cyber and physical entities to achieve specific goals still remains a challenge. Traditional service-oriented models and composition techniques are insufficient for CPS. In this paper, we present a novel Physical-Entity (PE) service-oriented model to address the problem, including the concepts of PE-ontology and PE-SOA specifications. Based on the model, we develop a two-level compositional reasoning approach, which divides the process into abstract and physical levels to expedite the composition process. With the assistance of the PE-ontology and PE-SOA, abstract level reasoning is performed by hiding the physical level details. This separation greatly reduces the search space for both levels through a divide-and-conquer technique. The model and the composition approach are illustrated using a simplified emergency response case study system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5410453/,2009 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA),14-15 Jan. 2009,ieeexplore
10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483745,Extensions and Application of the Robust Shared Response Model to Electroencephalography Data for Enhancing Brain-Computer Interface Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) decode electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from the human brain to predict subsequent behavior. While this technology has promising applications, successfully implementing a model is challenging. The typical BCI control application requires many hours of training data from each individual to make predictions of intended activity specific to that individual. Moreover, there are individual differences in the organization of brain activity and low signal-to-noise ratios in noninvasive measurement techniques such as EEG. There is a fundamental bias-variance trade-off between developing a single model for all human brains vs. an individual model for each specific human brain. The Robust Shared Response Model (RSRM) attempts to resolve this tradeoff by leveraging both the homogeneity and heterogeneity of brain signals across people. RSRM extracts components that are common and shared across individual brains, while simultaneously learning unique representations between individual brains. By learning a latent shared space in conjunction with subject-specific representations, RSRM tends to result in better predictive performance on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data relative to other common dimension reduction techniques. To our knowledge, we are the first research team attempting to expand the domain of RSRM by applying this technique to controlled experimental EEG data in a BCI setting. Using the openly available Motor Movement/ Imagery dataset, the decoding accuracy of RSRM exceeded models whose input was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and subject-specific PCA. The results of our experiments suggest that RSRM can recover distributed latent brain signals and improve decoding accuracy of BCI tasks when dimension reduction is implemented as a feature engineering step. Future directions of this work include augmenting state-of-the art BCI with efficient reduced representations extracted by RSRM. This could enhance the utility of BCI technology in the real world. Furthermore, RSRM could have wide-ranging applications across other machine-learning applications that require classification of naturalistic data using reduced representations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9483745/,2021 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS),29-30 April 2021,ieeexplore

An accurate gender recognition system can be used to reduce the search space in face recognition system for about half. However, since there is no definitive features of sexual dimorphism on human face that can be applied to all kind of face shapes from any race and age, it needs more studies to optimize the recognition system. Thus, this research investigates the implementation of complex-valued neural network as a classifier to recognize human gender which is based on face image. The experiment is also aimed to study the comparison between complex-valued and real-valued neural network. The methods proposed in this paper include image processing, feature extraction, and classification. After the face image processed by using local binary pattern to accentuate face texture and gradient filter to define face outline, the features of the face image is extracted by using histogram of oriented gradient. Then, the dimension of the resulted vectors is reduced by using principal component analysis. The final feature vectors is then used in neural network training and neural network testing processes. This paper shows investigation results in implementing the methods for some measurement parameters. The accuracy level of real-valued neural network system is a bit lower than the average accuracy level of complex-valued one, with 78.2% and 80.2% average accuracy rate, respectively.

Next, an optimal feature subset is selected from the extracted features through an improved quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm. Lastly, the elicited features are considered to perform the classification. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available manually created fake-face image dataset, namely Real and Fake Face Detection by Yonsei University.

Recent advances in deep graph learning have inspired various auspicious approaches for tackling the NA problem. However, most of the existing works suffer from efficiency and generalization, due to complexities and redundant computations.We approach the NA from a different perspective, tackling it via meta-learning in a semi-supervised manner, and propose an effective and efficient approach called Meta-NA - a novel, conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework. Specifically, we reformulate NA as a one-shot classification problem and address it with a graph meta-learning framework. Meta-NA exploits the meta-metric learning from known anchor nodes to obtain latent priors for linking unknown anchor nodes. It contains multiple sub-networks corresponding to multiple graphs, learning a unified metric space, where one can easily link entities across different graphs. In addition to the performance lift, Meta-NA greatly improves the anchor linking generalization, significantly reduces the computational overheads, and is easily extendable to multi-network alignment scenarios.

Experiments are conducted on five benchmark corpora using cross-validation to evaluate the proposed TSP approach. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that the TSP approach far outperforms the traditional and most widely used feature construction approach in spam filtering, which is named bag-of-words, in both performance and efficiency.

Most existing graph embedding approaches either embed the topological information and node features separately or learn one regularized embedding with both sources of information, however, they mostly overlook the interdependency between structural characteristics and node features when processing the graph data into the models. Moreover, existing methods only reconstruct the structural characteristics, which are unable to fully leverage the interaction between the topology and the features associated with its nodes during the encoding-decoding procedure. To address the problem, we propose a framework using autoencoder for graph embedding (GED) and its variational version (VEGD). The contribution of our work is two-fold: 1) the proposed frameworks exploit a feature-dependent graph matrix (FGM) to naturally merge the structural characteristics and node features according to their interdependency; and 2) the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) decoder of the proposed framework reconstructs both structural characteristics and node features, which naturally possesses the interaction between these two sources of information while learning the embedding.

Agents move onto the space for a fixed time and, when they encounter other agents into a predefined visibility range, they can decide to form a flock if they are similar. Flocks can join to form swarms of similar groups.

10.1109/R10-HTC.2018.8629835,Foody - Smart Restaurant Management and Ordering System,IEEE,Conferences,"Customers play a vital role in the contemporary food industry when determining the quality of the restaurant and its food. Restaurants give considerable attention to customers’ feedback about their service, since the reputation of the business depends on it. Key factors of evaluating customer satisfaction are, being able to deliver the services effectively to lessen the time of consumption, as well as maintaining a high quality of service. In most cases of selecting a prominent restaurant, customers focus on their choice of favorite food in addition to available seating and space options. Long waiting times and serving the wrong order is a common mistake that happens in every restaurant that eventually leads to customer dissatisfaction. Objectives of this online application “Foody” is to address these deficiencies and provide efficient and accurate services to the customer, by providing unique menus to each customer considering their taste. This concept is implemented as a mobile application using latest IT concepts such as Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Predictive Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. This includes graphics and 3D modeling that provide existent physical information related to food such as colors, sizes and further user can view the ingredients of the meal as well as the available tables. In addition, the app shows the real-time map to the restaurant. Current table reservation status is indicated by the color change of the table. Unique food recommendation and it’s order for each customer is generated by analyzing their social media information and the system notifies the customer the wait time by calculating it. Preparation of food and allocation is done subjectively. The expected outcome of the research is to develop a fully automated restaurant management system with the mentioned features as well as to avoid confusions between orders, provide better view of food and allow the customer to choose the menu according to their taste in a minimum time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8629835/,2018 IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC),6-8 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2014.7041373,Footstep planning on uneven terrain with mixed-integer convex optimization,IEEE,Conferences,"We present a new method for planning footstep placements for a robot walking on uneven terrain with obstacles, using a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware.

Existing vision based crowd counting schemes require favorable lighting conditions and also raise privacy concerns. RF based approaches rely on specialized sensors and require users to carry RF devices. Thus, an accurate, reliable and non-intrusive crowd counting scheme is still desired. In this paper, we propose FreeCount, a device-free crowd counting scheme that is able to precisely estimate the number of people within a region using only commodity WiFi routers. To this end, the channel state information (CSI) data in PHY layer is obtained directly by upgrading the router's software. We propose an information theory based feature selection scheme to select the most representative features that are sensitive to human motion. To build a classifier that is robust to temporal and environmental disparities, we adopt transfer kernel learning, which minimizes the difference between the source and target distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, is adopted to process the real-time CSI feature data.

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921432,From information revolution to intelligence revolution: Big data science vs. intelligence science,IEEE,Conferences,"The hierarchy of human knowledge is categorized at the levels of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence. For instance, given an AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy. At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 2<sup>1,000</sup> state space, known as `big data' in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000 bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero. Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world. Although data and information processing have been relatively well studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial, computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence. The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human knowledge and wisdom. Highly professional systems may help people to solve typical everyday problems. Towards these objectives, the latest advances in abstract intelligence and intelligence science investigated in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing are well positioned at the center of intelligence revolution.

The methodology of classical PCA is based on orthogonal projection defined in convex vector space. Thus, a norm between two projected vectors is unavoidably smaller than the norm between any two objects before implementation of PCA. Due to this, in some cases when the PCA cannot capture the data structure, its implementation does not necessarily confirm the real similarity of data in the higher dimensional space, making the results unacceptable. In order to avoid this problem for the purposes of high dimensional data clustering, we propose new Fuzzy PCA (FPCA) algorithm. The novelty is in the extracted similarity structures of objects in high-dimensional space and dissimilarities between objects based on their cluster structure and dimension when the algorithm is implemented in conjunction with known fuzzy clustering algorithms as FCM, GK or GG algorithms. This is done by using the fuzzy membership functions and modification of the classical PCA approach by considering the similarity structures during the construction of projections in smaller dimensional space. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested on several benchmark data sets.

The GPS data is extracted online to get the latitude and longitude information of a particular location. In the training phase, a 2-D axis transformation is used to relate local robot frame with the robot world coordinates and then the actual world coordinates are mapped from the GPS data using a RBFN (radial basis function network) based Neural Network. In the second phase, direct GPS data is used to get the mapping into the world coordinates of mobile robot using the trained network and the motion commands are generated accordingly. The physical placement of sonar devices, their ranging limits and beam opening angles are considered during navigation for possible collision detection and obstacle avoidance.

Second, the process selects a level from the set of hierachical geometric models depending on the value of visual acuity.

Then, the selected graphic models are rendered on the display.

Security practitioners need IoT network traffic data to develop and assess network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Emulating realistic network traffic will avoid the costly physical deployment of thousands of smart devices. From an attacker's perspective, generating network traffic that mimics the legitimate behavior of a device can be useful to evade NIDS. As network traffic data consist of sequences of packets, the problem is similar to the generation of sequences of categorical data, like word by word text generation. Many solutions in the field of natural language processing have been proposed to adapt a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate sequences of categorical data. In this paper, we propose to combine an autoencoder with a GAN to generate sequences of packet sizes that correspond to bidirectional flows. First, the autoencoder is trained to learn a latent representation of the real sequences of packet sizes. A GAN is then trained on the latent space, to learn to generate latent vectors that can be decoded into realistic sequences. For experimental purposes, bidirectional flows produced by a Google Home Mini are used, and the autoencoder is combined with a Wassertein GAN. Comparison of different network characteristics shows that our proposed approach is able to generate sequences of packet sizes that behave closely to real bidirectional flows.

Machine learning (ML) models have been proposed as popular alternatives that enable fast exploratory studies. The accuracy of any ML model depends heavily on the re-presentativeness of applications used for training the predictive models. While prior studies have used standard benchmarks or hand-tuned micro-benchmarks to train their predictive models, in this paper, we argue that it is often sub-optimal because of their limited coverage of the program state-space and their inability to be representative of the larger suite of real-world applications. In order to overcome challenges in creating representative training sets, we propose Genesys, an automatic workload generation methodology and framework, which builds upon key low-level application characteristics and enables systematic generation of applications covering a broad range of program behavior state-space without increasing the training time.

However, most existing non-local attention restorers are implemented based on pixels, which tend to be biased due to image degeneration. Furthermore, most non-local methods for image restoration are restricted to construct fully-connected correlations in a regular Euclidean space so that all features within the search region have to participate in the feature aggregation process, no matter how similar the key feature is to the query feature. To rectify these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a novel graph attention network for image restoration, dubbed GATIR, which establishes the non-local attention based on feature patches and utilizes the graph convolution to perform feature aggregation selectively in a non-Euclidean space. Experimental results demonstrate that our GATIR can achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic image denoising, real image denoising, image demosaicing, and compression artifact reduction tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9428448/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME),5-9 July 2021,ieeexplore

We propose a centralized graph kernel least mean squares (GKLMS) approach for identifying the nonlinear graph filters. The principles of coherence-check and random Fourier features (RFF) are used to reduce the dictionary size. Additionally, we leverage the graph structure to derive the graph diffusion KLMS (GDKLMS). The proposed GDKLMS requires only single-hop communication during successive time instants, making it viable for real-time network-based applications. In the distributed implementation, usage of RFF avoids the requirement of a centralized pre-trained dictionary in the case of coherence-check. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in modeling a nonlinear graph filter via numerical examples. The results show that centralized and distributed implementations effectively model the nonlinear graph filters, whereas the random-feature-based solutions are shown to outperform coherence-check based solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9443359/,"2020 54th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers",1-4 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

Fixed air quality stations as well as mobile gas sensors have been deployed for air quality monitoring but with sparse observations over the entire temporal-spatial space. Therefore, an inference algorithm is essential for comprehensive fine-grained air pollution sensing. Conventional physically-based models can hardly be applied to all the scenarios, while pure data-driven methods suffer from sampling bias and overfitting problems. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm for air pollution inference by guiding the data learning process with physical model. The quantitative combination of knowledge from observed dataset and a discretized convective-diffusion model is performed within a multi-task learning scheme. Evaluations show that, benefited from physical guidance, our hybrid method obtains higher extrapolation ability and more robustness, achieving the same performance with 1/8 sample amount and obtaining 31.9% less error in noisy synthesized environment.

However, it is still challenging to foresee the correlation between power consumption and HLS-based applications at an early design stage. To overcome this problem, we introduce HL-Pow, a power modeling framework for FPGA HLS based on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. HL-Pow incorporates an automated feature construction flow to efficiently identify and extract features that exert a major influence on power consumption, simply based upon HLS results, and a modeling flow that can build an accurate and generic power model applicable to a variety of designs with HLS. By using HL-Pow, the power evaluation process for FPGA designs can be significantly expedited because the power inference of HL-Pow is established on HLS instead of the time-consuming register-transfer level (RTL) implementation flow. Experimental results demonstrate that HL-Pow can achieve accurate power modeling that is only 4.67% (24.02 mW) away from onboard power measurement. To further facilitate power-oriented optimizations, we describe a novel design space exploration (DSE) algorithm built on top of HL-Pow to trade off between latency and power consumption. This algorithm can reach a close approximation of the real Pareto frontier while only requiring running HLS flow for 20% of design points in the entire design space.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9045442/,2020 25th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC),13-16 Jan. 2020,ieeexplore

Third, when dealing with large data sets, we let HOCT instead of operating system to manage swapping operations.

The hFP format is used successfully in computer graphics and video games for storage and data transfer. The IEEE 754-2008 standard settles that arithmetic operations must occur at least on single-precision floating-point format (sFP). This means that it is necessary to convert hFP to sFP for arithmetical operations and reconvert the results to hFP before storing it. The influence of successive conversions when simulating SNN is the main concern of this article. Three methods were used to evaluate the impact of hFP on SNNs: (i) F-I curve, (ii) subthreshold regime, and (iii) the time for the next spike. We have tested the leaky integrate-and-fire and the Izhikevich's neuron model; both presented similar results. The data show that SNNs simulated with sFP present equivalent results when compared to the ones simulated with hFP with identical topology. Such results are important because hFP requires half of the memory space, simpler buses, and lower bandwidth for transferring data. We may infer they require lower clock frequency consequently lower power consumption. These are essential factors for real-time simulation of SNN on embedded electronics. The sFP to hFP conversion circuits, and vice versa, may be implemented using few logical blocks in a field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) with no relevant Iatency. We conclude that data in the hFP format are suitable for SNNs synthesized in FPGAs, even though such implementations require conversion circuits.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489438/,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),8-13 July 2018,ieeexplore

Heterogeneous information network embedding is an effective HIN analysis method, it aims at projecting network elements into a lower-dimensional vector space for further machine learning related evaluations, such as node classification, node clustering, and so on. However, existing HIN embedding methods mainly focus on extracting the semantic-related information or close neighboring relations, while the high-level proximity of the network is also important but not preserved. To address the problem, in this paper we propose CGAT, a semi-supervised heterogeneous information network embedding method. We optimize the graph attention network by adding additional convolution layers, thereby we can extract multiple types of semantics and preserve high-level information in HIN embedding at the same time.

This problem has been traditionally addressed through the textual query. In other words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the textual similarity between queries and textual representation of software artifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers, and descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic information, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves. These source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing the efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we develop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method can capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic information hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source codes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which allows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent semantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by exploiting the joint power of both code and text features.

10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00146,Heterogeneous Transfer Clustering for Partial Co-occurrence Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Heterogeneous transfer clustering can translate knowledge from some related heterogeneous source domains to the target domain without any supervision. Existing works usually use a large amount of complete co-occurrence data to learn the projection functions mapping heterogeneous data to a common latent feature subspace. However, in many real applications, it is not practical to collect abundant co-occurrence data, while the available co-occurrence data are always incomplete. Another commonly encountered problem is that the complex structure of real heterogeneous data may result in substantial degeneration in clustering performance. To address these issues, we propose a heterogeneous transfer clustering method specifically designed for partial co-occurrence data (HTCPC). It is superior to the existing methods in three facets. First, HTCPC fully uses the partial co-occurrence data in both source and target domains to learn a latent space, maximally extracting useful knowledge for clustering from limited information. Second, it incorporates multi-layer hidden representations, accurately preserving the complex hierarchical structure of data. Third, it enforces approximately orthogonal constraint in representations, effectively characterizing the latent subspace with minimal redundancy. An efficient algorithm has been derived and implemented to realize the proposed HTCPC.

This paper proposes a novel approach that exploits deep latent correlation between visual and textual modalities. In our proposed method, we build a latent embedding space for symmetric heterogeneous feature transfer. The latent space is able to generate domain-specific and maximally correlative cross-domain features which are regarded as the semantic-intensive visual feature representation and used to train sentiment polarity classifiers.

The prediction performance further decreases when the size of the state space increases. We proposed a hierarchical context-dependent RL control framework that dynamically exerted control weights on model-based (MB) and multiple model-free (MF) RL strategies associated with different task goals. To properly assess the validity of the proposed method, we considered a two-stage Markov decision task (MDT) in which the three different types of context changed over time. We trained 57 different RL control models on a Caltech MDT data set; then, we assessed their prediction performance using a Bayesian model comparison.

Discovering and recognizing spatiotemporal objects (e.g., events) in such data is of paramount importance to the security and safety of facilities and individuals. What kind of computational model is necessary for discovering spatiotemporal objects at the level of abstraction they occur? Hierarchical invariant feature learning is the crux to the problems of discovery and recognition in Big Data. We present a multilayered convergent neural architecture for storing repeating spatially and temporally coincident patterns in data at multiple levels of abstraction. A node is the canonical computational unit consisting of neurons. Neurons are connected in and across nodes via bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections. The bottom-up weights are learned to encode a hierarchy of overcomplete and sparse feature dictionaries from space- and time-varying sensorial data by recursive layer-by-layer spherical clustering. The model scales to full-sized high-dimensional input data and also to an arbitrary number of layers thereby having the capability to capture features at any level of abstraction. The model is fully-learnable with only two manually tunable parameters. The model is generalpurpose (i.e., there is no modality-specific assumption for any spatiotemporal data), unsupervised and online. We use the learning algorithm, without any alteration, to learn meaningful feature hierarchies from images and videos which can then be used for recognition.

This is an autonomous decision support tool that reasons like humans and enables enhanced agent-based decision-making. It has applications in a large variety of domains including autonomous systems, operations research, intelligence analysis, and data mining. One of the most time consuming and key components of CECEP is the mining of knowledge from a repository described as a Cognitive Domain Ontology (CDO). One problem that is often tasked to CDOs is asset allocation. Given the number of possible solutions in this allocation problem, determining the optimal solution via CDO can be very time and energy consuming. A grid of isolated spiking neurons is capable of generating solutions to this problem very quickly, although some degree approximation is required to achieve the speedup. The approximate spiking approach presented in this work was able to complete nearly all allocation simulations with greater than 98% accuracy. Our results in this work show that constraining the possible solution space by creating specific rules for a scenario can alter the quality of the allocation result.

As per all SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) it is advisable to restrict number of visitors inside these enclosed spaces which are most likely to be weather controlled. Automatic safety compliance thus becomes imperative in such situations. Even though absolute compliance and alert signalling will require scrutiny and cross-checking at several levels, a beginning towards automation of compliance monitoring seems mandatory in the neo-normal era. Hence In this project we have designed a low cost rapidly implementable design to monitor the number of visitors inside the self-contained hall. The system will give signal once the maximum permissible visitor population is reached at a given time. Monitoring the optimal population and the density and enforcing visitor to wear mask even within the space manually is tantamount to imposing health hazards to the person who will physically have to monitor and it may as well render the visitors vulnerable.

For efficient resource controller design, tracking the right metrics in real-time (analytics) and making realistic predictions (deep learning) will play an important role to increase its efficiency. This factor becomes particularly critical as radio environments are generally dynamic, and the data sets collected may exhibit shift in distribution over time and/or space.

Quantifying the effect of various observational capabilities on long-range situational awareness in multi-robot teams,IEEE,Conferences,"In our previous work, we showed that individual robots within a multi-robot team can gain long-distance situational awareness from passive observations of a single nearby neighbor without any explicit robot-to-robot communication. However, that prior work was developed only in simulation, and performance was not measured for real robot teams in physical space with realistic hardware limitations. Toward this end, we studied the performance of these methods in real robot scenarios with methods using more sophisticated techniques in machine learning to mitigate practical implementation problems. In this study, we further extend that work by characterizing the effects of changing history length and sensor range. Rather than finding that increasing history length and sensor range always yield better estimation performance, we find that the optimal history length and sensor range varies depending on the distance between the estimating robot and the robot being estimated. For estimation problems where the estimation target is nearby, longer histories actually degrade performance, and so sensor ranges could be increased instead. Conversely, for farther targets, history length is as valuable or more valuable than sensor range. Thus, just as optimal shutter speed varies with light availability and speed of the subject, passive situational awareness in multi-robot teams is best achieved with different strategies depending on proximity to locations of interest.

10.1109/ICCSE.2018.8468759,How to Enhance Chinese Word Segmentation Using Knowledge Graphs,IEEE,Conferences,"Chinese word segmentation is a very important problem for Chinese information processing. Chinese word segmentation results are the basis for computers to understand natural language. However, unlike most Western languages, Chinese words do not have fixed symbols like white space as word segmentation marks. Moreover, Chinese has a very complex grammar, and the word segmentation criteria are varied with the contexts. Therefore, Chinese word segmentation is a very difficult task. Many existing works have proposed many algorithms to solve this problem. However, to our best knowledge, none of them could outperform all the other methods. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm based on semantics and contexts. We propose a semantic-based word similarity measure using the concept hierarchy in knowledge graphs, and use this measure to prune the different results which are generated by several state-of-the-art Chinese word segmentation methods. The idea is to respectively compute the concept similarity of these words to other words in the text, and choose the word with the highest concept similarity score. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct a series of experiment on two real datasets. The results show that our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms by filtering out wrong results and retaining correct ones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8468759/,2018 13th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE),8-11 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/IoTDI.2015.19,"Human SLAM, Indoor Localisation of Devices and Users",IEEE,Conferences,"The indoor localisation problem is more complex than just finding whereabouts of users. Finding positions of users relative to the devices of a smart space is even more important. Unfortunately, configuring such systems manually is a tedious process, requires expert knowledge, and is sensitive to changes in the environment. Moreover, many existing solutions do not take user privacy into account. We propose a new system, called Simultaneous Localisation and Configuration (SLAC), to address the problem of locating devices and users relative to those devices, and combine this problem into a single estimation problem. The SLAC algorithm, based on FastSLAM, is able to locate devices using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of devices and motion data from users. Simulations have been used to show the performance in a controlled environment and the effect of the amount of RSSI updates on the localisation error. Live tests in non-trivial environments showed that we can achieve room level accuracy and that the localisation can be performed in real time. This is all done locally, i.e. running on a user's device, with respect for privacy and without using any prior information of the environment or device locations. Although promising, more work is required to increase accuracy in larger environments and to make the algorithm more robust for environment noise caused by walls and other objects.

First, the upper body poses of standing persons are classified into seven categories of views. For each category, a mean template, variance template, and percentage template are generated. Then, the template region is divided into positive and negative regions, corresponding to the region of bodies and surrounding open space. A weak classifier is designed for each pixel in the template. A new EM-like Adaboost learning algorithm is designed to learn the Adaboost template. Different from existing Adaboost classifiers, we show that the Adaboost template can be used not only for recognition but also for adaptive top-down segmentation. By using Adaboost template, only a few positive samples for each category are required for learning. Comparison with conventional template matching techniques has been made. Experimental results show that significant improvements can be achieved in both cases.

ANFIS is an intelligence method which combines both fuzzy inference system and neural networks. The basis of the method is the representation of each action as a bivariate histogram that is computed from skeleton history image in one action duration. Skeleton image is extracted from the human silhouette in each frame then these images gather to generate skeleton history image. This approach automatically performs segmentation on the feature space with RANSAC algorithm to select some features yielded better results. Also some actions, which are similar in spatial features such as 'sit down' and 'stand up' but they are inverse in temporal domain, are discriminated with temporal window implemented in the first half duration.

A layered representation of the human figure is adopted. Skeletal posture is determined from magnetic sensors on the body, using heuristics and inverse kinematics. This paper describes the use of implicit function techniques in the synthesis and animation of a polymesh geometric skin over the skeletal structure. Implicit functions perform detection and handling of collisions with an optimal worst case time complexity that is linear in the number polymesh vertices. Body deformations resulting from auto-collisions are handled elegantly and homogeneously as part of the environment.

These advancements are due to the extensive application of mobile robots for autonomous exploration. Mobile robots are being popularly used for applications in space, underwater explorations, underground coal mines monitoring, inspection in chemical/toxic/ nuclear factories etc. But if these environments are unknown/unpredictable, conventional/ classical robotics may not serve the purpose. In such cases robot learning is the best option. Learning from the past experiences, is one such way for real time application of robots for completely unknown environments. Reinforcement learning is one of the best learning methods for robots using a constant system-environment interaction.

The tracking data is given as time series data, from which the characteristic states are extracted. Each human motion has a specific state transition pattern that consists of characteristic states. To recognize these motions, the specific state transition patterns of the motions are defined as fuzzy rules and these fuzzy rules are implemented in a fuzzy associative memory system. This method is independent of the person being measured and the speed of the motion. In real time experiments, this method was able to recognize three basic tennis motions (forehand stroke, backhand stroke, and smash) for six unspecified people.

To build an accurate machine learning model for quality prediction, it is necessary to find major input parameters which have a big influence in quality prediction. The procedure of identifying major factors out of original high-dimensional input parameters is called to be feature selection. This paper proposes a hybrid method for feature selection, which effectively reduces the searching space by leveraging feature subset chosen by Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF) and Relief-based feature selection. The computational complexity is proved to be quadratic in feature number, while most of the existing methods suffer from exponential computation complexity. This improvement is crucial especially when we deal with high-dimensional input parameters because it dramatically reduces the computational time.

10.1109/TAI.1998.744843,IBHYS: a new approach to learn users habits,IEEE,Conferences,"Learning interface agents search regularities in the user behavior and use them to predict user's actions. We propose a new inductive concept learning approach, called IBHYS, to learn such regularities. This approach limits the hypothesis search to a small portion of the hypothesis space by letting each training example build a local approximation of the global target function. It allows to simultaneously search several hypothesis spaces and to simultaneously handle hypotheses described in different languages. This approach is particularly suited for learning interface agents because it provides an incremental algorithm with low training time and decision time, which does not require the designer of the interface agent to describe in advance and quite carefully the repetitive patterns searched. We illustrate our approach with two autonomous software agents, the Apprentice and the Assistant, devoted to assist users of interactive programming environments and implemented in Objectworks Smalltalk-80. The Apprentice learns user's work habits using an IBHYS algorithm and the Assistant, based on what has been learnt, proposes to the programmer sequences of actions the user might want to redo.

10.1109/CSCN.2015.7390444,IEEE 1900.6b: Sensing support for spectrum databases,IEEE,Conferences,"A number of key examples of spectrum databases in wireless communications either persist or are in the process of being instantiated. Perhaps one of the most notable recent developments in this area is the spectrum databases that enable secondary usage of TV White Space (TVWS), authorized by regulators such as the FCC in the US, Ofcom in the UK, and various others internationally. Such developments have moved away from spectrum sensing for detection and secondary usage of TV band spectrum opportunities. However, it is clear that spectrum sensing might still viably assist opportunistic spectrum usage, even from a regulatory point of view, both in TVWS and in other forms of spectrum sharing. This also might be the case in wireless communications in general (e.g., in the context of self-organizing networks), particularly when spectrum sensing methods are employed to enhance or verify the operation of spectrum databases. To this end, the IEEE 1900.6 working group is undertaking an amendment standard project, IEEE 1900.6b, on spectrum sensing support for spectrum databases. This paper addresses the IEEE 1900.6 background, and reasoning for the 1900.6b amendment standard, as well as the use cases for the amendment standard and the deployment scenarios and benefits for such standardized spectrum sensing support for spectrum databases. It also provides qualitative arguments of the benefits of the approach using real information from an operational TVWS spectrum database compared with measurements at the same location. It is shown that spectrum sensing to support such a database might viably increase the amount of TV band spectrum available at that location for opportunistic usage, with 4 Watts EIRP, from around 24 MHz to around 240 MHz.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7390444/,2015 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN),28-30 Oct. 2015,ieeexplore

It is particularly true in nowadays urban cities with a large number of high buildings. One of the key tasks is to infer the location height of mobile devices, e.g., the floor within a high building where mobile devices are located. However, precise height estimation is challenging due to complex Telco signal propagation within an indoor 3D space, sparse cell tower deployment and scarce training samples. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose an indoor MR height estimation framework, namely IFLoc, via a machine learning model. IFLoc first builds a training MR database via a pre-processing step to comfortably tag raw MR samples by precisely inferred height from auxiliary data such as GPS and barometer readings. Next, IFLoc trains a regression model for height estimation by a set of developed techniques including 3D space division, post-processing techniques, feature augmentation and an improved SVR (Supported Vector Regression) model. Our evaluation on eight real datasets collected within five representative high buildings in Shanghai validates that IFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in particularly with scarce training data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162333/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

While systems have been developed to enable visibility into parking space vacancies for drivers, most rely on costly, dedicated sensor devices that require high installation costs. The proliferation of inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) devices enables the use of compute platforms with integrated cameras that could be used to monitor parking space occupancy. However, even with camera-captured images, manual specification of parking space locations is required before such devices can be used by drivers after device installation.

They have achieved great success in this field but the main obstacles for deploying a DNN model into an Autonomous Driver Assisted System (ADAS) platform are limited memory, constrained resources, and limited power. MobileNet is a very efficient and light DNN model which was developed mainly for embedded and computer vision applications, but researchers still faced many constraints and challenges to deploy the model into resource-constrained microprocessor units. Design Space Exploration of such CNN models can make them more memory efficient and less computationally intensive. We have used the Design Space Exploration technique to modify the baseline MobileNet V1 model and develop an improved version of it. This paper proposes seven modifications on the existing baseline architecture to develop a new and more efficient model. We use Separable Convolution layers, the width multiplier hyperparamater, alter the channel depth and eliminate the layers with the same output shape to reduce the size of the model. We achieve a good overall accuracy by using the Swish activation function, Random Erasing technique and a choosing good optimizer. We call the new model as Ultra-thin MobileNet which has a much smaller size, lesser number of parameters, less average computation time per epoch and negligible overfitting, with a little higher accuracy as compared to the baseline MobileNet V1. Generally, when an attempt is made to make an existing model more compact, the accuracy decreases. But here, there is no trade off between the accuracy and the model size. The proposed model is developed with the intent to make it deployable in a realtime autonomous development platform with limited memory and power and, keeping the size of the model within 5 MB. It could be successfully deployed into NXP i.MX RT1060 ADAS platform due to its small model size of 3.9 MB.

The Generative Adversary Network (GAN) problem of not being steady and challenging to train was overwhelmed by utilizing latent space representation. The dimension is reduced compared to the distorted or corrupted image in training the GAN. Then reinforcement learning was deployed to pick the correct GAN input to get the image’s latent space representation that is most suitable for the current input of the missing or distorted image region.

In this paper three architectures for the recognition of dynamic gestures using the above mentioned techniques or a hybrid combination of them are presented and compared. For all architectures a common preprocessor receives as input a sequence of color images, and produces as output a sequence of feature vectors of continuous parameters. The first two systems are hybrid architectures consisting of a combination of neural networks and hidden Markov models (HMM). NNs are used for the classification of single feature vectors while HMMs for the modeling of sequences of them with the aim to exploit the properties of both these tools.

Three issues are dealt with in this paper - finding a feasible inverse kinematic solution without using any orientation information, resolving redundancy at position level and finally maintaining the fidelity of information during clustering process thereby increasing accuracy of inverse kinematic solution. A 3-dimensional KSOM lattice is used to locally linearize the inverse kinematic relationship. The joint angle vector is divided into two groups and their effect on end-effector position is decoupled using a concept called function decomposition. It is shown that function decomposition leads to significant improvement in accuracy of inverse kinematic solution. However, this method yields a unique inverse kinematic solution for a given target point. A concept called sub-clustering in configuration space is suggested to preserve redundancy during learning process and redundancy is resolved at position level using several criteria.

We describe an FPGA implementation of Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) networks with online learning that outperforms mobile GPU implementations by an order of magnitude or more. Specifically, we provide an embedded Python-capable PYNQ FPGA implementation supported with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) workflow that allows sub-millisecond implementation of adaptive neural networks with low-latency, direct I/O access to the physical world. We tune the precision of the different intermediate variables in the code to achieve competitive absolute accuracy against slower and larger floating-point reference designs. The online learning component of the neural network exploits immediate feedback to adjust the network weights to best support a given arithmetic precision. As the space of possible design configurations of such networks is vast and is subject to a target accuracy constraint, we use the Hyperopt hyper-parameter tuning tool instead of manual search to find Pareto optimal designs. Specifically, we are able to generate the optimized designs in under 500 iterations of Vivado HLS before running the complete Vivado place-and-route phase on that subset. For neural network populations of 64-4096 neurons and 1-8 representational dimensions our optimized FPGA implementation generated by Hyperopt has a speedup of 10-484× over a competing cuBLAS implementation on the Jetson TX1 GPU while using 2.4-9.5× less power.

However, in large or correlated data sets, association rule mining may yield huge rule sets. Hence several pruning techniques have been proposed to select a small subset of high-quality rules. Since the availability of a ldquorichrdquo rule set may improve the accuracy of the classifier, we argue that rule pruning should be reduced to a minimum. A small subset of high-quality rules is first considered. When this set is not able to classify the data, a larger rule set is exploited. This second set includes rules usually discarded by previous approaches. To cope with the need of mining large rule sets and to efficiently use them for classification, a compact form is proposed to represent a complete rule set in a space-efficient way and without information loss.

To the best of our knowledge, most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework which encodes the code into a hidden space and then decode it into natural language space, suffering from two major drawbacks: a) Their encoders only consider the sequential content of code, ignoring the tree structure which is also critical for the task of code summarization; b) Their decoders are typically trained to predict the next word by maximizing the likelihood of next ground-truth word with previous ground-truth word given. However, it is expected to generate the entire sequence from scratch at test time. This discrepancy can cause an exposure bias issue, making the learnt decoder suboptimal. In this paper, we incorporate an abstract syntax tree structure as well as sequential content of code snippets into a deep reinforcement learning framework (i.e., actor-critic network). The actor network provides the confidence of predicting the next word according to current state. On the other hand, the critic network evaluates the reward value of all possible extensions of the current state and can provide global guidance for explorations.

Our analysis of a real workload file (LANL CM 5) revealed differences of up to two orders of magnitude between requested memory capacity and actual memory usage. The problem of over-provisioning has received very little attention so far. We discuss different approaches for applying machine learning methods to estimate the actual resource capacities used by jobs.

The deluge of IoT data creates enormous opportunities for us to explore the physical world, especially with the help of deep learning techniques. Traditionally, the Cloud is the option for deploying deep learning based applications. However, the challenges of Cloud-centric IoT systems are increasing due to significant data movement overhead, escalating energy needs, and privacy issues. Rather than constantly moving a tremendous amount of raw data to the Cloud, it would be beneficial to leverage the emerging powerful IoT devices to perform the inference task. Nevertheless, the statically trained model could not efficiently handle the dynamic data in the real in-situ environments, which leads to low accuracy. Moreover, the big raw IoT data challenges the traditional supervised training method in the Cloud. To tackle the above challenges, we propose In-situ AI, the first Autonomous and Incremental computing framework and architecture for deep learning based IoT applications. We equip deep learning based IoT system with autonomous IoT data diagnosis (minimize data movement), and incremental and unsupervised training method (tackle the big raw IoT data generated in ever-changing in-situ environments). To provide efficient architectural support for this new computing paradigm, we first characterize the two In-situ AI tasks (i.e. inference and diagnosis tasks) on two popular IoT devices (i.e. mobile GPU and FPGA) and explore the design space and tradeoffs. Based on the characterization results, we propose two working modes for the In-situ AI tasks, including Single-running and Co-running modes. Moreover, we craft analytical models for these two modes to guide the best configuration selection. We also develop a novel two-level weight shared In-situ AI architecture to efficiently deploy In-situ tasks to IoT node.

10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958856,Inferring clinical depression from speech and spoken utterances,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting depression from recordings of subjects' speech using speech processing and machine learning. There has been considerable interest in this problem in recent years due to the potential for developing objective assessments from real-world behaviors, which may provide valuable supplementary clinical information or may be useful in screening. The cues for depression may be present in “what is said” (content) and “how it is said” (prosody). Given the limited amounts of text data, even in this relatively large study, it is difficult to employ standard method of learning models from n-gram features. Instead, we learn models using word representations in an alternative feature space of valence and arousal. This is akin to embedding words into a real vector space albeit with manual ratings instead of those learned with deep neural networks [1]. For extracting prosody, we employ standard feature extractors such as those implemented in openSMILE and compare them with features extracted from harmonic models that we have been developing in recent years. Our experiments show that our features from harmonic model improve the performance of detecting depression from spoken utterances than other alternatives. The context features provide additional improvements to achieve an accuracy of about 74%, sufficient to be useful in screening applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6958856/,2014 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP),21-24 Sept. 2014,ieeexplore

10.1109/SPW53761.2021.00016,Innocent Until Proven Guilty (IUPG): Building Deep Learning Models with Embedded Robustness to Out-Of-Distribution Content,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep Neural Network classifiers trained with the conventional Categorical Cross-Entropy loss face problems in real-world environments such as a tendency to produce overly confident posterior distributions on out-of-distribution inputs, sensitivity to adversarial noise, and lost performance due to distributional shift. We hypothesize that a central shortcoming -an inability to effectively process out-of-distribution content within inputs-exacerbates each of these setbacks. In response, we propose a novel learning framework called Innocent Until Proven Guilty which prototypes training data clusters or classes within the input space while uniquely leveraging noise and inherently random classes to discover noise-resistant, uniquely identifiable features of the modeled classes. In evaluation, we leverage both academic computer vision datasets and realworld JavaScript and URL datasets for malware classification. Across these interdisciplinary settings, we observe favorable classification performance on test data, decreased loss of performance due to recency bias, decreased false-positive responses on noise samples, and decreased vulnerability in several noisebased attack simulations when compared to a baseline network of equal topology trained with Categorical Cross-Entropy. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that demonstrates significantly decreased vulnerability to blackbox append attacks on malware. By applying the well-known FastGradient Sign Method, we show the potential to combine our framework with existing adversarial learning techniques and discover favorable performance by a significant margin. Our framework is general enough for use with any network topology that could otherwise be trained with Categorical Cross-Entropy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474279/,2021 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW),27-27 May 2021,ieeexplore

In addition, we have extended a conventional algorithm for incremental feature update for developing a dynamic feature space in operational environment.

10.1109/SP40000.2020.00073,Intriguing Properties of Adversarial ML Attacks in the Problem Space,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent research efforts on adversarial ML have investigated problem-space attacks, focusing on the generation of real evasive objects in domains where, unlike images, there is no clear inverse mapping to the feature space (e.g., software). However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of problem-space attacks remain underexplored.This paper makes two major contributions. First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved semantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility. We shed light on the relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the concept of side-effect features as the byproduct of the inverse feature-mapping problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe several attacks from related literature across different domains.Second, building on our formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack on Android malware that overcomes past limitations. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android apps from 2017 and 2018 show the practical feasibility of evading a state-of-the-art malware classifier along with its hardened version. Our results demonstrate that ""adversarial-malware as a service"" is a realistic threat, as we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous adversarial applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes to generate an adversarial app. Yet, out of the 1600+ papers on adversarial ML published in the past six years, roughly 40 focus on malware [15]-and many remain only in the feature space.Our formalization of problem-space attacks paves the way to more principled research in this domain.

10.1109/SAHCN.2015.7338346,JICE: Joint data compression and encryption for wireless energy auditing networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Fine-grained real-time metering is a fundamental service of wireless energy auditing networks, where metering data is transmitted from embedded power meters to gateways for centralized processing, storage, and forwarding. Due to limited meter capability and wireless bandwidth, the increasing sampling rates and network scales needed to support new energy auditing applications pose significant challenges to metering data fidelity and secrecy. This paper exploits the compression and encryption properties of compressive sensing (CS) to design a joint data compression and encryption (JICE) approach that addresses these two challenges simultaneously. Compared with a conventional signal processing pipeline that compresses and encrypts data sequentially, JICE reduces computation and storage complexities due to its simple design. It thus leaves more processor time and available buffer space for handling lossy wireless transmissions. Moreover, JICE features a machine-learning-based reconfiguration mechanism that adapts its signal representation basis to changing power patterns autonomously. On a smart plug platform, we implemented JICE and several baseline approaches including downsampling, lossless compression, and the pipeline approach. Extensive testbed experiments show that JICE achieves higher data delivery ratios and lower recovery distortions under a range of realistic settings. In particular, JICE increases the number of meters supported by a gateway by 50%, compared with the pipeline approach, while keeping a distortion rate lower than 5%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7338346/,"2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)",22-25 June 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00037,Joint Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Resilient WiFi-Enabled Device-Free Gesture Recognition,IEEE,Conferences,"Human gesture recognition plays a critical role in numerous applications of human-computer interaction. By analyzing how gesture alters the WiFi propagation among WiFi-enabled IoT devices to identify the gestures in a device-free manner could be a promising solution. However, existing methods require tedious data collection and labeling process each time being implemented in a new environment. The classifier constructed by SVM or random forest is vulnerable to spatial dynamics. In this paper, we proposed JADA, a novel unsupervised Joint adversarial domain adaptation (JADA) scheme that realizes accurate and resilient WiFi-enabled device-free gesture recognition without collecting and labeling training data in new environments. After constructing a source encoder and a source classifier in the source domain by convolutional neural network, JADA trains a target encoder and also fine-tunes the source encoder through adversarial learning to map both unlabeled target data and labeled source data to a domain-invariant feature space such that a domain discriminator cannot distinguish the domain labels of the data. After training a shared classifier with the labeled source data while fixing the parameters of the source encoder, we employ the trained target encoder to embed the test target samples into the domain-invariant feature space and infer its class using the shared classifier. We develop a novel Channel State Information (CSI) enabled IoT platform that could obtain fine-grained CSI time series data directly from IoT devices and transform them into CSI frames. Real-world experiments with COTS WiFi routers were conducted in 2 indoor environments. The experimental results demonstrate that JADA achieves 98.75% gesture recognition accuracy in the original environment. Moreover, when the environmental scenario is altered, it is able to reduce the domain discrepancy across domains without collecting any labeled data in the new context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614062/,2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),17-20 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9431114,Keynote: Explainable-by-design Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"MACHINE and AI justifiably attract the attention and interest not only of the wider scientific community and industry, but also society and policy makers. However, even the most powerful (in terms of accuracy) algorithms such as deep learning (DL) can give a wrong output, which may be fatal. Due to the opaque and cumbersome model structure used by DL, some authors started to talk about a dystopian “black box” society. Despite the success in this area, the way computers learn is still principally different from the way people acquire new knowledge, recognise objects and make decisions. People do not need a huge amount of annotated data. They learn by example, using similarities to previously acquired prototypes, not by using parametric analytical models. Current ML approaches are focused primarily on accuracy and overlook explainability, the semantic meaning of the internal model representation, reasoning and its link with the problem domain. They also overlook the efforts to collect and label training data and rely on assumptions about the data distribution that are often not satisfied. The ability to detect the unseen and unexpected and start learning this new class/es in real time with no or very little supervision is critically important and is something that no currently existing classifier can offer. The challenge is to fill this gap between high level of accuracy and the semantically meaningful solutions. The most efficient algorithms that have fuelled interest towards ML and AI recently are also computationally very hungry - they require specific hardware accelerators such as GPU, huge amounts of labeled data and time. They produce parametrised models with hundreds of millions of coefficients, which are also impossible to interpret or be manipulated by a human. Once trained, such models are inflexible to new knowledge. They cannot dynamically evolve their internal structure to start recognising new classes. They are good only for what they were originally trained for. They also lack robustness, formal guarantees about their behaviour and explanatory and normative transparency. This makes problematic use of such algorithms in high stake complex problems such as aviation, health, bailing from jail, etc. where the clear rationale for a particular decision is very important and the errors are very costly. All these challenges and identified gaps require a dramatic paradigm shift and a radical new approach. In this talk the speaker will present such a new approach towards the next generation of computationally lean ML and AI algorithms that can learn in real-time using normal CPUs on computers, laptops, smartphones or even be implemented on chip that will change dramatically the way these new technologies are being applied. It is explainable-by-design. It focuses on addressing the open research challenge of developing highly efficient, accurate ML algorithms and AI models that are transparent, interpretable, explainable and fair by design.

This is often the case in computer vision and medical diagnosis applications. A novel conic section classifier (CSC) was recently introduced in the literature to handle such datasets, wherein each class was represented by a conic section parameterized by its focus, directrix and eccentricity. The discriminant boundary was the locus of all points that are equi-eccentric relative to each class-representative conic section. Simpler boundaries were preferred for the sake of generalizability. In this paper, we improve the performance of the two-class classifier via a large margin pursuit. When formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, the margin computation is demonstrated to be hard, especially due to the high dimensionality of the data. Instead, we present a geometric algorithm to compute the distance of a point to the non-linear discriminant boundary generated by the CSC in the input space.

In this paper we introduce an original technique named ""Latent Replay"" where, instead of storing a portion of past data in the input space, we store activations volumes at some intermediate layer. This can significantly reduce the computation and storage required by native rehearsal. To keep the representation stable and the stored activations valid we propose to slow-down learning at all the layers below the latent replay one, leaving the layers above free to learn at full pace. In our experiments we show that Latent Replay, combined with existing continual learning techniques, achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex video benchmarks such as CORe50 NICv2 (with nearly 400 small and highly non-i.i.d. batches) and OpenLORIS. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of nearly real-time continual learning on the edge through the deployment of the proposed technique on a smartphone device.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341460/,2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),24 Oct.-24 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/WACV51458.2022.00373,Latent to Latent: A Learned Mapper for Identity Preserving Editing of Multiple Face Attributes in StyleGAN-generated Images,IEEE,Conferences,"Several recent papers introduced techniques to adjust the attributes of human faces generated by unconditional GANs such as StyleGAN. Despite efforts to disentangle the attributes, a request to change one attribute often triggers unwanted changes to other attributes as well. More importantly, in some cases, a human observer would not recognize the edited face to belong to the same person. We propose an approach where a neural network takes as input the latent encoding of a face and the desired attribute changes and outputs the latent space encoding of the edited image. The network is trained offline using unsupervised data, with training labels generated by an off-the-shelf attribute classifier. The desired attribute changes and conservation laws, such as identity maintenance, are encoded in the training loss. The number of attributes the mapper can simultaneously modify is only limited by the attributes available to the classifier – we trained a network that handles 35 attributes, more than any previous approach. As no optimization is performed at deployment time, the computation time is negligible, allowing real-time attribute editing. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the current state-of-the-art show our method is better at conserving the identity of the face and restricting changes to the requested attributes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9706683/,2022 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV),3-8 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore

The DFNN is based on extended Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks, which are functionally equivalent to Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems. The algorithm comprises 4 parts: (1) Criteria of rules generation; (2) Allocation of premise parameters; (3) Determination of consequent parameters and (4) Pruning technology. The salient characteristics of the approach are: (1) A hierarchical on-line self-organizing learning paradigm is employed so that not only parameters can be adjusted, but also the determination of structure can be self-adaptive without partitioning the input space a priori; (2) Fast learning speed can be achieved so that the system can be implemented in real time. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated in application to a demanding, highly nonlinear, missile control design task. Scheduling on instantaneous incidence (a rapidly varying quantity) is well known to lead to considerable difficulties with classical gain-scheduling methods. It is shown that the methods proposed here can, however, be used to successfully design an effective intelligent controller.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7076545/,2001 European Control Conference (ECC),4-7 Sept. 2001,ieeexplore

As technology sustainably enhances the quality of life, intelligent systems continue to contribute solutions to some of the biggest challenges faced by humans. Autonomous vehicles offer humans the opportunity to increase transportation safety by reducing human errors on the road, preventing accidents, improving human productivity by reducing commuting time, and possibly mitigating air pollution. There is a critical shortage of educational and training programs in autonomous vehicles due to the high cost of full-size vehicles, computing and sensor equipment, and big lab space needed. To address this problem, we develop a 1/10-scale autonomous vehicle powered by pre-collision detection, lane tracking, and road sign recognition systems. The pre-collision system is built using ultrasonic sensors, and the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is implemented to manipulate the vehicle's safety response. The Open-Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) is exploited to detect and process real-time on-road streaming video to enable lane-tracking and road sign recognition. AI techniques are utilized for the model training. Preliminary results of this work are presented and analyzed.

The ability to correct the trajectory in response to haptic feedback and accomplish the task despite location uncertainties is an important skill. We hypothesize that this skill would facilitate generalization and support direct transfer from simulations to real world. To reduce sample complexity, we propose to learn a residual admittance policy (RAP). RAP is learned to correct the movements generated by a baseline policy in the framework of dynamic movement primitives. Given the reference trajectories generated by the baseline policy, the action space of RAP is limited to the admittance parameters. Using deep reinforcement learning, a deep neural network is trained to map task specifications to proper admittance parameters. We demonstrate that RAP handles uncertainties in board location, generalizes well over space, size and shape, and facilitates quick transfer learning. Most impressively, we demonstrate that the policy learned in simulations achieves similar robustness to uncertainties, generalization and performance when deployed on an industrial robot (UR5e) without further training.

The specificity of our work is to learn a film restorer's expertise from a pair of sequences, composed of a movie with defects, and the same movie which was semiautomatically restored with the help of a specialized software. In order to detect those defects with minimal human interaction and further reduce the time spent for a restoration, we feed a U-Net with consecutive defective frames as input to detect the unexpected variations of pixel intensity over space and time. Since the output of the network is a mask of defect location, we first have to create the dataset of mask frames on the basis of restored frames from the software used by the film restorer, instead of classical synthetic ground truth, which is not available. These masks are estimated by computing the absolute difference between restored frames and defectuous frames, combined with thresholding and morphological closing.

10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0048,Learning User Embedding Representation for Gender Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Predicting the gender of users in social media has aroused great interests in recent years. Almost all existing studies rely on the the content features extracted from the main texts like tweets or reviews. It is sometimes difficult to extract content information since many users do not write any posts at all. In this paper, we present a novel framework which uses only the users' ids and their social contexts for gender prediction. The key idea is to represent users in the embedding connection space. A user often has the social context of family members, schoolmates, colleagues, and friends. This is similar to a word and its contexts in documents, which motivates our study. However, when modifying the word embedding technique for user embedding, there are two major challenges. First, unlike the syntax in language, no rule is responsible for the composition of the social contexts. Second, new users were not seen when learning the representations and thus they do not have embedding vectors. Two strategies circular ordering and incremental updating are proposed to solve these problems. We evaluate our methodology on two real data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is significantly better than the traditional graph representation and the state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines.

We formulate a model for a multi-radar tracker system by combining a radar performance model with a tracker performance model. A tracker as a complex software system is hard to model mathematically and physically. Our novel approach is to utilize machine learning to create a tracker model based on measurement data from which the input and target output for the model are calculated. The measured data comprises the time series of 3D coordinates of cooperative aircraft flights, the corresponding target detection recordings from multiple radars, and the related multi-radar track recordings. The collected data is used to calculate performance measures for the radars and the tracker at specific locations in the air space. We apply genetic programming to learning such rules from radar performance measures that explain tracker performance. The easily interpretable rules are intended to reveal the real behavior of the system providing comprehension for its control and further development. The learned rules allow predicting tracker performance level for the system control in all radar geometries, modes, and conditions at any location. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of our approach to learning a tracker model and compare our rule learner with two tree classifiers, another rule learner, a neural network, and an instance-based classifier using the real air surveillance data.

10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899802,Learning opposites using neural networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Many research works have successfully extended algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement agents and neural networks using “opposition-based learning” (OBL). Two types of the “opposites” have been defined in the literature, namely type-I and type-II. The former are linear in nature and applicable to the variable space, hence easy to calculate. On the other hand, type-II opposites capture the “oppositeness” in the output space. In fact, type-I opposites are considered a special case of type-II opposites where inputs and outputs have a linear relationship. However, in many real-world problems, inputs and outputs do in fact exhibit a nonlinear relationship. Therefore, type-II opposites are expected to be better in capturing the sense of “opposition” in terms of the input-output relation. In the absence of any knowledge about the problem at hand, there seems to be no intuitive way to calculate the type-II opposites. In this paper, we introduce an approach to learn type-II opposites from the given inputs and their outputs using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). We first perform opposition mining on the sample data, and then use the mined data to learn the relationship between input x and its opposite x̌. We have validated our algorithm using various benchmark functions to compare it against an evolving fuzzy inference approach that has been recently introduced. The results show the better performance of a neural approach to learn the opposites. This will create new possibilities for integrating oppositional schemes within existing algorithms promising a potential increase in convergence speed and/or accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7899802/,2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),4-8 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore

However, most of the applications have been limited to game domains or discrete action space which are far from the real world driving. Moreover, it is very tough to tune the parameters of reward mechanism since the driving styles vary a lot among the different users. For instance, an aggressive driver may prefer driving with high acceleration whereas some conservative drivers prefer a safer driving style. Therefore, we propose an apprenticeship learning in combination with deep reinforcement learning approach that allows the agent to learn the driving and stopping behaviors with continuous actions. We use gradient inverse reinforcement learning (GIRL) algorithm to recover the unknown reward function and employ REINFORCE as well as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to learn the optimal policy.

Therefore, precluding straightforward implementation of standard detectors, for example, the whitening minimum variance distortionless response filter. Using random projections, we can reduce the dimension of the radar problem by random sampling, i.e. by projecting the data into a random d-dimensional subspace. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) theorem provides theoretical guarantees which explicitly states that the low dimensional data after random projections is only very slightly perturbed when compared to the data from the original problem in an l<sub>2</sub> norm sense. Random projections offers significant computational savings permitting possible real time solutions, however, at the cost of reducing the clairvoyant SINR for radar STAP. To alleviate this issue of SINR loss, we use localized random projections where the random projection matrix incorporates the look angle information, thereby minimizing the noise and interference effects from other angles, and increasing the SINR.

The model is designed to run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware, used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that ""Cells that fire together, wire together"", with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener.

The driver and occupants of the vehicle access Internet, and different intelligent transportation system (ITS) related services such as real-time traffic information, parking space availability, downloading the map, etc., in a vehicle to infrastructure communication (V2I) mode. In a highly dynamic network environment like vehicular network, software-defined networking (SDN) promises to be an ideal solution. However, it also opens doors for various distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. An attacker can easily flood short-lived spoofed flows and exhaust network resources. This motivates us to find a solution to detect the attacks in a V2I communication under SDN. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) based DDoS attack detection. The proposed system uses various ML schemes, and few of them found to be accurate with a high detection rate and a relatively low false alarm rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8650452/,TENCON 2018 - 2018 IEEE Region 10 Conference,28-31 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

The system integrates the individually enhanced stereo-based human detection, HOG-based human detection, color-based tracking, and motion estimation for the robust detection and tracking of humans with large appearance and scale variations in real-world environments. A new framework of maximum likelihood based multi-model fusion is proposed to fuse these four human detection and tracking models according to the detection-track associations in 3D space, which is robust to the possible missed detections, false detections, and duplicated responses from the individual models. Multi-person tracking is implemented in a sequential near-to-far way, which well alleviates the difficulties caused by human-over-human occlusions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed system under real-world scenarios with large variations in lighting conditions, cluttered backgrounds, human clothes and postures, and complex occlusion situations. Significant improvements in human detection and tracking have been achieved.

10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00146,MLCask: Efficient Management of Component Evolution in Collaborative Data Analytics Pipelines,IEEE,Conferences,"With the ever-increasing adoption of machine learning for data analytics, maintaining a machine learning pipeline is becoming more complex as both the datasets and trained models evolve with time. In a collaborative environment, the changes and updates due to pipeline evolution often cause cumbersome coordination and maintenance work, raising the costs and making it hard to use. Existing solutions, unfortunately, do not address the version evolution problem, especially in a collaborative environment where non-linear version control semantics are necessary to isolate operations made by different user roles. The lack of version control semantics also incurs unnecessary storage consumption and lowers efficiency due to data duplication and repeated data pre-processing, which are avoidable.In this paper, we identify two main challenges that arise during the deployment of machine learning pipelines, and address them with the design of versioning for an end-to-end analytics system MLCask. The system supports multiple user roles with the ability to perform Git-like branching and merging operations in the context of the machine learning pipelines. We define and accelerate the metric-driven merge operation by pruning the pipeline search tree using reusable history records and pipeline compatibility information. Further, we design and implement the prioritized pipeline search, which gives preference to the pipelines that probably yield better performance. The effectiveness of MLCask is evaluated through an extensive study over several real-world deployment cases. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed merge operation is up to 7.8x faster and saves up to 11.9x storage space than the baseline method that does not utilize history records.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9458924/,2021 IEEE 37th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),19-22 April 2021,ieeexplore

Firstly, we propose a computationally efficient Bag-of-Words (BoW) pipeline along with improved accuracy of violent videos classification. The novel pipeline's feature extraction stage is implemented with densely sampled Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF) descriptors rather than Space-Time Interest Point (STIP) based extraction. Secondly, in encoding stage, we propose Outlier-Resistant VLAD (OR-VLAD), a novel higher order statistics-based feature encoding, to improve the original VLAD performance. In classification, efficient Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) is employed. The performance of the proposed pipeline is evaluated with three popular violent action datasets.

However, especially in real-time scenarios where the properties of rapidly changing surroundings are unknown, creating a persistently coherent sound field synthesis within a real space is a challenging problem. While AR devices and their sensors can usually provide depth information within the field of view of the user, retrieving a complete geometric model requires significant time and user activity. Prior acoustic measurements or scans of the deployment area also severely limit many use cases, especially in the consumer sector. In this paper, we propose an automatic system that provides a fast selection of room categories and their corresponding binaural reverberation using only monoscopic images as input information. The proposed system combines existing approaches of machine learning (ML) based room classification and parametric synthesis of binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) to provide room reverberation for arbitrary indoor environments. As a proof of concept, we present a demonstrator developed in Cycling’74s Max linked to a python-based ML model. For the ML model, we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) GoogLeNet architecture trained on a subset of the Places365 data set. This subset contains 20 custom indoor room categories which are composed of the original categories that share similar acoustic properties. The demonstrator captures images and automatically selects binaural reverberation based on the predictions of the ML classifier.

Simulation is commonly used for understanding architectural tradeoffs, however many emerging workloads cannot even run on many full-system simulators. Even if you manage to run an emerging workload, it may be a tiny part of the workload, because detailed simulators are prohibitively slow. This talk presents some examples of how machine learning can be used to solve some of the problems haunting the performance evaluation field. An application for machine learning is in cross-platform performance and power prediction. If one model is slow to run real-world benchmarks/workloads, is it possible to predict/estimate its performance/power by using runs on another platform? Are there correlations that can be exploited using machine learning to make cross-platform performance and power predictions? A methodology to perform cross-platform performance/power predictions will be presented in this talk. Another application illustrating the use of machine learning to calibrate analytical power estimation models will be discussed. Yet another application for machine learning has been to create max power stressmarks. Manually developing and tuning so called stressmarks is extremely tedious and time-consuming while requiring an intimate understanding of the processor. In our past research, we created a framework that uses machine learning for the automated generation of stressmarks. In this talk, the methodology of the creation of automatic stressmarks will be explained.

However, the space limitation and the residents' increasing awareness of environmental protection issues in the island make international vendors unavoidably have to rent tanks from domestic oil companies. In order to help the leaseholder maximize revenue by increasing the availability of tanks, an efficient maintenance scheduling is needed. This paper introduces a tabu-based genetic algorithm (TGA) and its implementation for solving a real-world maintenance scheduling problem of oil storage tanks.

This paper propose a way of managing a dynamic indoor environment by defining a multi-layered indoor model in terms of an object mobility. It allows an indoor space to be managed more elaborate and realistic than up-to-date indoor models which only consider an indoor floor plan. We firstly define a classification of indoor objects based on their characteristic to frequently change location, and propose three-layers indoor model followed by the classified objects with its mobility.

In this work, we demonstrate that we can further speed up CNN inference and lower its power consumption by mapping systolic arrays onto 3D circuit structures as opposed to conventional 2D structures. Specifically, by operating in 3D space, a wide systolic array consisting of a number of subarrays can efficiently implement wide convolutional layers prevalent in state of the art CNNs. Additionally, by accumulating intermediate results along the third dimension, systolic arrays can process partitioned data channels in parallel with reduced data skew for lowered inference latency. We present a building block design using through-silicon vias (TSVs) for the 3D realization of systolic subarrays. We validate the 3D scheme using a 2.5D FPGA design and demonstrate that when mapped onto 3D structures wide systolic arrays can scale up in size without increasing wiring length in interconnecting subarrays. Further, by taking full advantage of 3D structures, we are able to pipeline inference across multiple layers of a CNN over a series of systolic arrays, dramatically reducing the inference time per input sample. These improvements lead to significantly reduced inference latency, which is especially important for real-time applications where it is common to process samples one at a time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8598454/,2018 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS),21-24 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

Feature selection is one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure. Then an extensive empirical evaluation is performed for eight different feature selection methods, using one synthetic dataset and three real-world marketing datasets at Uber to cover different use cases. Based on the empirical results, the selected mRMR method is implemented in production for the marketing machine learning platform.

10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00144,Maxson: Reduce Duplicate Parsing Overhead on Raw Data,IEEE,Conferences,"JSON is a very popular data format in many applications in Web and enterprise. Recently, many data analytical systems support the loading and querying JSON data. However, JSON parsing can be costly, which dominates the execution time of querying JSON data. Many previous studies focus on building efficient parsers to reduce this parsing cost, and little work has been done on how to reduce the occurrences of parsing. In this paper, we start with a study with a real production workload in Alibaba, which consists of over 3 million queries on JSON. Our study reveals significant temporal and spatial correlations among those queries, which result in massive redundant parsing operations among queries. Instead of repetitively parsing the JSON data, we propose to develop a cache system named Maxson for caching the JSON query results (the values evaluated from JSONPath) for reuse. Specifically, we develop effective machine learning-based predictor with combining LSTM (long shortterm memory) and CRF (conditional random field) to determine the JSONPaths to cache given the space budget. We have implemented Maxson on top of SparkSQL. We experimentally evaluate Maxson and show that 1) Maxson is able to eliminate the most of duplicate JSON parsing overhead, 2) Maxson improves end-to-end workload performance by 1.5-6.5×.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9101499/,2020 IEEE 36th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),20-24 April 2020,ieeexplore

The majority of malignant skin lesions present at a general practice level where a diagnosis is based on a clinical decision algorithm. As a false negative diagnosis is an unacceptable outcome, clinical caution tends to result in a low positive predictive value of as low at 8%. There has been a large burden of surgical excisions that retrospectively prove to have been unnecessary.This paper proposes a method to identify melanomas in dermoscopic images using a convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method implements transfer learning based on the ResNet50 CNN, pretrained using the ImageNet dataset. Datasets from the ISIC Archive were implemented during training, validation and testing. Further tests were performed on a smaller dataset of images taken from the Dermnet NZ website and from recent clinical cases still awaiting histological results to indicate the trained network's ability to generalise to real cases. The 86% test accuracy achieved with the proposed method was comparable to the results of prior studies but required significantly less pre-processing actions to classify a lesion and was not dependant on consistent image scaling or the presence of a scale on the image.

10.1109/VRAIS.1995.512486,Model based vision as feedback for virtual reality robotics environments,IEEE,Conferences,"Task definition methods for robotic systems are often difficult to use. The ""on-line"" programming methods are often time expensive or risky for the human operator or the robot itself. On the other hand, ""off-line"" techniques are tedious and complex. In addition operator training is costly and time consuming. In a Virtual Reality Robotics Environment (VRRE), users are not asked to write down complicated functions, but can operate complex robotic systems in an intuitive and cost-effective way. However a VRRE is only effective if all the environment changes and object movements are fed-back to the virtual manipulating system. The paper describes the use of a VRRE for a semi-autonomous robot system comprising an industrial 5-axis robot, its virtual equivalent and a model based vision system used as feed-back. The user is immersed in a 3-D space built out of models of the robot's environment. He directly interacts with the virtual ""components"", defining tasks and dynamically optimizing them. A model based vision system locates objects in the real workspace to update the VRRE through a bi-directional communication link. In order to enhance the capabilities of the VRRE, a reflex-type behavior based on vision has been implemented. By locally (independently of the VRRE) controlling the real robot, the operator is discharged of small environmental changes due to transmission delays. Thus once the tasks have been optimized on the VRRE, they are sent to the real robot and a semi autonomous process ensures their correct execution thanks to a camera directly mounted on the robot's end effector. On the other hand if the environmental changes are too important, the robot stops, re-actualizes the VRRE with the new environmental configuration, and waits for task redesign. Because the operator interacts with the robotic system at a task oriented high level, VRRE systems are easily portable to other robotics environments (mobile robotics and micro assembly).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/512486/,Proceedings Virtual Reality Annual International Symposium '95,11-15 March 1995,ieeexplore

Some works are concentrated in the use of planning techniques to solve problems; however, one of the difficulties in applying such techniques in workflow problems is the size of the search space required for the real world problems. An alternative is the use of evolutionary computing techniques, particularly genetic algorithms that in general are more suitable for these problems. In this context, we will present an architecture based on the use of a genetic planner in order to allow the automatic generation of process modeling.

When designing Fuzzy Logic controllers (FLCs) there is no generalized defined approach and these controllers are mainly based on linguistically defined variables which are non-linear elements, that are impossible to model accurately. Our test results shows that the fuzzy controller's output highly depends on the fuzzy rules. In some situations, very experienced and a skillful expert's solutions (fuzzy rules) even may not satisfy the desired output. In many cases FLCs rule bases have been designed according to trial-and-error method which makes the optimization of the solution very difficult. As a solution, FLC of the Sensored BLDC motor was tuned through a stochastic search optimization technique which is based on GA (Genetic Algorithm) and the GA parameters (Crossover, Mutation rates etc.) adapted through another TSK-FLC (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type FLC) in real-time. The optimization stochastic search process was implemented using a fitness function index (i.e. a predefined threshold level) which is calculated from the population (randomly generated solutions by the GA) based on the E (Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). The simulated test results shows the proposed control technique has effectively reduced the maximum overshoot, settling time, steady state error and the rise time by 12%, 15%, 11% and 1% respectively. But further research is needed to optimize the search algorithm to increase the Genetic-Fuzzy controller's efficiency and the stability to withstand external disturbances while increasing the frequency for various desired input signal wave pattern trajectories.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8300340/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS),15-16 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore

To diagnose diseases, clinical researchers use a machine-learning algorithm to do multi-label clinical text classification.

Diagnostic information from the EHRs (Electronic Health Records) is mainly constructed by unstructured clinical free text which is an obstacle for clinical feature extraction. Moreover, feature engineering is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the rapid development of deep learning, we apply neural network models to resolve this problem mentioned above.

Given a set of origin-destination pair, there could be many possible routes for a driver. Search for shortest route from one point to another on a weighted graph is a well known problem and has several solutions like Dijkstra algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm etc. But in case of car navigation systems the shortest path may not be the best one from the point of view of driver's satisfaction. So, for a practical car navigation system in dynamical environment, we need to specify multiple and separate good (near optimal) choices according to multiple criteria which make the search space too large to find out the solution in real time by deterministic algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GA) are now widely used to solve search problems with applications in practical routing and optimization problems. GA includes a variety of quasi optimal solutions, which can be obtained in a given time. In this work we propose a GA based algorithm to find out simultaneously several alternate routes depending on different criterion according to driver's choice such as shortest path by distance, path which contains minimum number of turns, path passing through mountains or by the side of a river etc. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated by simulation experiment using real road map compared to other existing GA based algorithms.

A key challenge in design, however, is that programming such chips is difficult. This paper proposes a systematic methodology with a set of tools to address this challenge. The proposed toolset is called NEUTRAMS (Neural network Transformation, Mapping and Simulation), and includes three key components: a neural network (NN) transformation algorithm, a configurable clock-driven simulator of neuromorphic chips and an optimized runtime tool that maps NNs onto the target hardware for better resource utilization. To address the challenges of hardware constraints on implementing NN models (such as the maximum fan-in/fan-out of a single neuron, limited precision, and various neuron models), the transformation algorithm divides an existing NN into a set of simple network units and retrains each unit iteratively, to transform the original one into its counterpart under such constraints. It can support both spiking neural networks (SNNs) and traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). With the combination of these tools, we have explored the hardware/software co-design space of the correlation between network error-rates and hardware constraints and consumptions. Doing so provides insights which can support the design of future neuromorphic architectures.

However, network state and traffic typically exhibit unpredictable variations due to stochastically arriving requests with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. Thus, an adaptive online SFC deployment approach is needed to handle the real-time network variations and various service requests. In this paper, we firstly introduce a Markov decision process (MDP) model to capture the dynamic network state transitions. In order to jointly minimize the operation cost of NFV providers and maximize the total throughput of requests, we propose NFVdeep, an adaptive, online, deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically deploy SFCs for requests with different QoS requirements. Specifically, we use a serialization-and-backtracking method to effectively deal with large discrete action space. We also adopt a policy gradient based method to improve the training efficiency and convergence to optimality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NFVdeep converges fast in the training process and responds rapidly to arriving requests especially in large, frequently transferred network state space. Consequently, NFVdeep surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by 32.59% higher accepted throughput and 33.29% lower operation cost on average.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9068634/,2019 IEEE/ACM 27th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS),24-25 June 2019,ieeexplore

Artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers can perform well however their computational requirements can be very large for real time implementation. In this paper, a data-based modeling neural network such as modified probabilistic neural network (MPNN) is introduced which partitions the decision space nonlinearly in order to achieve reliable classification, however still with acceptable computations.

These strategies are applied to train neural networks with small integer weights. Such neural networks are better suited for hardware implementation than the real weight ones. Furthermore, we constrain the weights and biases in the range [-2/sup k/+1, 2/sup k/-1], for k=3,4,5. Thus, they can be represented by just k bits. These algorithms have been designed keeping in mind that the resulting integer weights require less bits to be stored and the digital arithmetic operations between them are more easily implemented in hardware. Obviously, if the network is trained in a constrained weight space, smaller weights are found and less memory is required. On the other hand, the network training procedure can be more effective and efficient when large weights are allowed. Thus, for a given application, a trade-off between effectiveness and memory consumption has to be considered. We present the results of evolution algorithms for this difficult task. Based on the application of the proposed class of methods on classical neural network benchmarks, our experience is that these methods are effective and reliable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/785521/,Proceedings of the 1999 Congress on Evolutionary Computation-CEC99 (Cat.

In addition, the speed of recognition, high computational cost, and real-time implementation are also problems that haunt image processing. Thus, new measures are required to solve these problems. This paper reports on a new approach to solving the aforementioned problems. The novel idea is based on combining neural network arbitration and scale space analysis to automatically select one optimum scale for the entire image at which scale space edge detection can be applied. This approach to edge detection is formalised in the automatic edge detection scheme (AEDS).

However, age deterioration of the localization model due to dynamic environmental changes degrades its accuracy. Therefore, periodic model recalibration is inescapable. Existing methods for doing this use transfer learning and a small set of additional and supervised datasets. However, the reference points to obtain these datasets are determined either randomly or comprehensively. Such poor datasets catastrophically destabilize model recovery after recalibration because overfitting occurs. We propose a new approach that detects anomalous reference points to gain felicitous supervised datasets in order to prevent overfitting. Unsupervised datasets obtained from off-the-shelf mobile navigation applications, i.e., user logs uploaded from phones, are used. Our approach is implemented in a system we call ""No-Sweat Detective"". The results of an experiment in a controlled environment demonstrate that No-Sweat Detective can detect anomalies caused by environmental changes, and the results of a five-month experiment show that No-Sweat Detective has redundancy against a complex open-space environment in the real world.

Real-world networks are usually related with each other via common nodes, the so-called multiplex network. To make the data mining work on the multiplex network more actionable, it become urgent and essential to transform it into low-dimension vector space. Recently, several works have been proposed to leverage the complementary information for embedding. However, they suffer from sacrificing distinct properties of the counterparts in different layers, as they preserve much noise information into embedding vectors. In this paper, we propose a Noise-Aware Network Embedding approach for Multiplex Network, namely NANE. Unlike previous works, NANE considers the roles of an identical node in different layers, and adopts a more robust and flexible strategy to rationally integrate the cross-layer information while keeping the unique characteristic of each layer.

We state the co-clustering problem in terms of non-parametric generative models which can address the issue of estimating the number of row and column clusters from a hypothesis space of an infinite number of clusters. To reach large scale applications of co-clustering we exploit that parameter inference for co-clustering is well suited for parallel computing. We develop a generic GPU framework for efficient inference on large scale sparse bipartite networks and achieve a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to estimation based on conventional CPUs. In terms of scalability we find for networks with more than 100 million links that reliable inference can be achieved in less than an hour on a single GPU. To efficiently manage memory consumption on the GPU we exploit the structure of the posterior likelihood to obtain a decomposition that easily allows model estimation of the co-clustering problem on arbitrary large networks as well as distributed estimation on multiple GPUs. Finally we evaluate the implementation on real-life large scale collaborative filtering data and web scale text corpora, demonstrating that latent mesoscale structures extracted by the co-clustering problem as formulated by the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) are consistent across consecutive runs with different initializations and also relevant for interpretation of the underlaying processes in such large scale networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6064611/,2011 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing,18-21 Sept. 2011,ieeexplore

However, these systems have to face a challenge: how to recommend new songs in a situation where prior knowledge is scarce. Some researches take auxiliary information into consideration in new recommendation approaches to deal with this problem. Nevertheless, they rarely pay attention to complex relationships among different feature spaces when they map those information to a latent space. To this end, this paper proposes an approach that uses non-linear transformation to integrate different auxiliary information into the songs latent representations. Unlike other studies which directly map auxiliary information to the feature space, the proposed music recommendation model (NeuTrans) maps different information features to low-dimensional vector representation by non-linear neural networks. Specifically, the NeuTrans separately employs matrix factorization and attribute network embedding to extract auxiliary information (historical interaction, network structure and attributes of songs). The feature space of different information is obtained by nonlinearly mapping the feature space of the songs.

Especially coastal regions and bays with shallow waters are strongly influenced by tidal dynamics. Meanwhile, in offshore study areas with harsh environmental conditions as well as dynamic ocean currents and water levels, continuous in-situ investigations of the prevailing current conditions requires a high effort. In-situ measurement technology is thereby maintenance-intensive and partly limited in time or space by limited accessibility or restricted by the measurement method. In hence, remote sensing techniques based on video image information, such as Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) for sensing, and computer vision algorithms for long-term investigation of the prevailing dynamic near-surface ocean flow conditions, have become highly relevant. However, in some environmental situations there may be not sufficient or significant natural textures evaluable in the visual camera images, or only insufficient contrast ratio under varying ambient illumination at the water observation site, to perform image based velocimetry.

In such techniques, a single transmit-antenna is activated during each time instant and the activated antenna index is used to convey information. Due to the novel method of conveying information, a major criticism arises on the practicality of such techniques in the presence of real-time imperfections such as channel estimation errors. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to shed light on this issue. The performance of such systems are analyzed in the presence of Gaussian imperfect channel estimations. More specifically, the performance of SSK system consisting of N<sub>t</sub> transmit and N<sub>r</sub> receive antennas with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver is studied. The exact average bit error probability (ABEP) over Rayleigh fading channels is obtained in closed-form for N<sub>t</sub> = 2 and arbitrary N<sub>r</sub>; while union upper bound is used to compute the ABEP when N<sub>t</sub> &gt;; 2 and arbitrary N<sub>r</sub>. Furthermore, simple and general asymptotic expression for the ABEP is derived and analyzed. Besides, the effect of imperfect CSI on the performance of SM, Alamouti and SSK schemes considering different number of channel estimation pilots are studied and compared via numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that, on the contrary to the raised criticism, space modulation techniques are more robust to channel estimation errors than Alamouti since the probability of error is determined by the differences between channels associated with the different transmit antennas rather than the actual channel realization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6239909/,2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring),6-9 May 2012,ieeexplore

10.1109/IPDPSW.2017.131,On-FPGA real-time processing of biological signals from high-density MEAs: a design space exploration,IEEE,Conferences,"High-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) are promising tools to tackle fundamental questions in neuroscience and brain diseases with unprecedented experimental capabilities. The acquisition of the biological signals sampled by such MEAs, that usually involves filtering, preliminary processing and finally data storage, is an intrinsically parallel and computation-intensive activity, particularly in systems targeting thousands of recording channels acquired with sub-millisecond time resolution. Within several applications, these operations need to be performed in real-time. A promising solution offering an adequate performance level relies on parallel hardware structures, making FPGA devices the perfect target technology. In this paper, we present an evaluation of an acquisition and processing system, to be implemented on an FPGA device, which is conceived to be connected to multi-channel CMOS-MEAs and is specifically designed for in-vitro and in-vivo recordings of neural activity. The template, implemented on reconfigurable logic, performs the first steps of the computing chain: filtering and adaptive detection of neural spikes. The filtered samples together with information regarding the presence of spikes are stored in an external DDR memory, for further elaboration and communication with the external environment. We performed a design space exploration measuring resource utilization and precision of the detection algorithm for different use-cases, corresponding to different state-of-the-art HDMEAs, and for different application parameters, such as the filtering scheme, number of parallel input channels, and sampling frequency.

10.1109/NAECON.2018.8556744,Onboard Image Processing for Small Satellites,IEEE,Conferences,"In general, the computational ability of spacecraft and satellites has lagged behind terrestrial computers by several generations. Moore's Law turns the supercomputers of yesterday into the laptops of today, but space computing remains relatively underpowered due to the harsh radiation environment and low risk-tolerance of most space missions. Space missions are generally low risk because of the high cost of components and launch. However, launch costs are drastically decreasing and innovations such as CubeSats are changing the risk equation. By accepting more risk and utilizing commercial of the shelf (COTS) parts, it is possible to cheaply build and launch extremely capable computing platforms into space. High performance satellites will be required for advanced interplanetary exploration due to latency challenges. The long transmission times between planets means satellites or robotic explorers need onboard processing to perform tasks in real-time. This paper explores one possible application that could be hosted onboard the next generation of high performance satellites, performing object classification on satellite imagery. Automation of satellite imagery processing is currently performed by servers or workstations on Earth, but this paper will show that those algorithms can be moved onboard satellites by using COTS components. First traditional computer vision techniques such as edge detection and sliding windows are used to detect possible objects on the open ocean. Then a modern neural network architecture is used to classify the object as a ship or not. This application is implemented on a Nvidia Jetson TX2 and measurements of the application's power use confirm that it fits within the Size Weight and Power (SWAP) requirements of SmallSats and possibly even CubeSats.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8556744/,NAECON 2018 - IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference,23-26 July 2018,ieeexplore

Comparing to a traditional OCSVM, the proposed quasi-linear OCSVM is expected to capture a more compact region in the input space.

10.23919/INM.2017.7987462,Online learning and adaptation of network hypervisor performance models,IEEE,Conferences,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) paved the way for a logically centralized entity, the SDN controller, to excerpt near real-time control over the forwarding state of a network. Network hypervisors are an in-between layer to allow multiple SDN controllers to share this control by slicing the network and giving each controller the power over a part of the network. This makes network hypervisors a critical component in terms of reliability and performance. At the same time, compute virtualization is ubiquitous and may not guarantee statically assigned resources to the network hypervisors. It is therefore important to understand the performance of network hypervisors in environments with varying compute resources. In this paper we propose an online machine learning pipeline to synthesize a performance model of a running hypervisor instance in the face of varying resources. The performance model allows precise estimations of the current capacity in terms of control message throughput without time-intensive offline benchmarks. We evaluate the pipeline in a virtual testbed with a popular network hypervisor implementation. The results show that the proposed pipeline is able to estimate the capacity of a hypervisor instance with a low error and furthermore is able to quickly detect and adapt to a change in available resources. By exploring the parameter space of the learning pipeline, we discuss its characteristics in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence time for different parameter choices and use cases.

Then we perform variational posterior inference in an augmented variable space and the approximate posterior of model weights, rather than point estimates as in traditional SVR, are used to make robust predictions. Besides, once the approximate posterior is obtained from a given set of data, we can regard it as model prior when dealing with new arrival data, which leads to a natural way to extend our batch model to the online scenario.

This paper proposes to fill this gap by using contextual information to infer how perceived entities are expected to behave, and thus what are the consequences of these behaviours on the subject vehicle. For this purpose, an ontology is formulated about the vehicle, perceived entities and context (map information) to provide a conceptual description of all road entities with their interaction. It allows for inferences of knowledge about the situation of the subject vehicle with respect to the environment in which it is navigating. The framework is applied to the navigation of a vehicle as it approaches road intersections, to demonstrate its applicability. Results from the real-time implementation on a vehicle operating under controlled conditions are included.

Although there has been a great improvement in the use of generative adversarial networks to generate images, it remains a challenging project to ensure that the semantics of the generated images are consistent with the semantics of the input text descriptions. This study proposed a Real-Fake Images Parallel Text Redescription Module (RFIPTRM) for advancing MirrorGAN based on the idea of mirroring and reconstructed the loss of the image generation model by adding the loss between the real text and the text from generated images to the genarators for balancing the textual semantic space. Intuitively, there may be inconsistency between the textual semantic space structure of our real text and the generated image, so we conducted adversarial learning between redescriptive text from the real images and the real text to improve the inconsistency of this text space structure. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the public benchmark datasets CUB and COCO have proved that PTR-MirrorGAN is superior to other methods and achieved a better generation effect.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9532027/,2020 7th International Conference on Information Science and Control Engineering (ICISCE),18-20 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

A stable learner predicts based on all of its experience, whereas are active learner predicts based on its experience over a short, recent window of time. The method of paired learning uses differences in accuracy between the two learners over this window to determine when to replace the current stable learner, since the stable learner performs worse than does there active learner when the target concept changes. While the method uses the reactive learner as an indicator of drift, it uses the stable learner to predict, since the stable learner performs better than does the reactive learner when acquiring target concept. Experimental results support these assertions. We evaluated the method by making direct comparisons to dynamic weighted majority, accuracy weighted ensemble, and streaming ensemble algorithm (SEA) using two synthetic problems, the Stagger concepts and the SEA concepts, and three real-world data sets: meeting scheduling, electricity prediction, and malware detection.

This kind of generalization may not adapt well to the emerging industrial Internet, where the normal behaviors are more diverse and usually embedded in the raw payloads' local structures. In this paper, we tackle this generalization problem and propose a very different solution to payload-based anomaly detection without the need of feature engineering. Our basic idea is to learn the raw structures of normal payloads directly by a generative adversarial network (GAN), in which we have a generator (i.e., a reversed convolutional decoder) to sample raw payloads from a latent space as well as a discriminator (i.e., a convolutional classifier) to guide the generator produce raw payloads approximating the normal structures. We also deploy an assisted convolutional encoder to map the true payloads back to the latent space and combine with the GAN's decoder (i.e., generator) to reconstruct the payload structures. We consider anomalies appear in condition the re-constructed payloads are largely deviated from the true ones, since our encoder-decoder architecture is trained able to rebuild only the normal payload structures.

They are increasingly being used on mobile devices, many times just by porting large models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes, making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer, based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2× slowdown. On the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves the intended results, with performance speedups of 3× with cuDNN and above 10× with Arm Compute Library and TVM.

The RGB-D sensor is thereby placed at the ceiling and observes a shared workspace for human-robot collaboration in the industrial domain. The pixelwise information about certain body parts of the human worker is used by a cognitive system for the optimization of interaction and collaboration processes. In this context, for rational decision making and planning, the pixelwise predictions must be reliable despite the high variability of the appearance of the human worker. In our approach we treat the problem as a pixelwise classification task, where we train a random decision forest classifier on the information contained in depth frames produced by a synthetic representation of the human body and the ceiling sensor, in a virtual environment. As shown in similar approaches, the samples used for training need to cover a broad spectrum of the geometrical characteristics of the human, and possible transformations of the body in the scene. In order to reduce the number of training samples and the complexity of the classifier training, we therefore apply an elaborated and coupled strategy for randomized training data sampling and feature extraction. This allows us to reduce the training set size and training time, by decreasing the dimensionality of the sampling parameter space. In order to keep the creation of synthetic training samples and real-world ground truth data simple, we use a highly reduced virtual representation of the human body, in combination with KINECT skeleton tracking data from a calibrated multi-sensor setup.

Several studies show that they are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and attackers have the ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. Considering the realistic scenario, where the recommender system is usually a black-box for attackers and complex algorithms may be deployed in them, how to learn effective attack strategies on such recommender systems is still an under-explored problem. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data poisoning framework, PoisonRec, which can automatically learn effective attack strategies on various recommender systems with very limited knowledge. PoisonRec leverages the reinforcement learning architecture, in which an attack agent actively injects fake data (user behaviors) into the recommender system, and then can improve its attack strategies through reward signals that are available under the strict black-box setting. Specifically, we model the attack behavior trajectory as the Markov Decision Process (MDP) in reinforcement learning. We also design a Biased Complete Binary Tree (BCBT) to reformulate the action space for better attack performance.

In this paper, we focus on automatic construction of piecewise affine models from input-output data. Given a set of examples, where each example consists of a d-dimensional real-valued input vector mapped to a real-valued output, we want to compute a set of affine functions that covers all the data points up to a specified degree of accuracy, along with a disjoint partitioning of the space of all inputs defined using a Boolean combination of affine inequalities with one region for each of the learnt functions. While traditional machine learning algorithms such as linear regression can be adapted to learn the set of affine functions, we develop new techniques based on automatic construction of interpolants to derive precise guards defining the desired partitioning corresponding to these functions. We report on a prototype tool, MOSAIC, implemented in Matlab. We evaluate its performance using some synthetic data, and compare it against known techniques using data-sets modeling electronic placement process in pick-and-place machines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6986111/,2014 International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT),12-17 Oct. 2014,ieeexplore

We may train a role classification algorithm on another dataset, but then that dataset may have largely different values of its features, for instance, the degrees in the other network may be distributed in a completely different way than in the first network. Thus, a way to transfer the features of different networks to each other or to a common feature space is needed. This type of setting is called transfer learning. In this paper, we present a transfer learning approach to network role classification based on feature transformations from each network's local feature distribution to a global feature space. We implement our approach and show experiments on real-world networks of discussions on Wikipedia as well as online forums.

10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489412,Prediction of Spatial Spectrum in Cognitive Radio using Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"In cognitive radio networks, it is desirable to determine radio spectrum usage in frequency, time, and spatial domains. Spectrum data improves cognitive radio network planning, sensing, routing, and security. Due to cost concerns, spectrum monitors are deployed sparsely in space, spectrum usage at nearby locations can be modeled for use in these applications. Previous work using neural networks for spatial spectrum prediction involved prior knowledge of transmitter locations as input to the models. In practical scenarios, the prior knowledge is not available. Hence, this work considers prediction of the spatial spectrum without knowing the transmitter location information. The prediction task is achieved by using a specialized recurrent neural network known as Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Network (CSRN). Our investigation shows the proposed recurrent neural network operates in real-time and is generalized to offer spectrum estimations without further changes to the network, even when a transmitter location is changed. The experiments are conducted in a challenging indoor environment to assess the performance in a practical scenario. Our results suggest the CSRN can learn efficiently to predict signal across an indoor space while transmitters move to different locations. We perform a performance comparison of our proposed technique with an MLP based estimation method. Our analysis further suggests that the CSRN achieves comparable prediction accuracy to that of the MLP based method. The major advantage of the proposed CSRN based method is the ability to perform prediction from new radio configurations without retraining the network, and, hence is more suitable for a real-time practical environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489412/,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),8-13 July 2018,ieeexplore

Latencies in head-motion compensation cause virtual objects to swim around instead of being stable in space. This results in an unnatural feel, disorientation, and simulation sickness in addition to errors in fitting/matching of virtual and real objects. Visual update delays are a critical technical obstacle for implementation of head-mounted displays in a wide variety of applications. To address this problem, we propose to use machine learning techniques to define a forward model of head movement based on angular velocity information. In particular, we utilize recurrent neural network to capture the temporal pattern of pitch and yaw motion.

The real-time tracking of tumor motion however requires a prediction model to compensate the latencies induced by the software (image data acquisition and processing) and hardware (mechanical and kinematic) limitations of the treatment system. A new prediction algorithm based on local receptive fields extreme learning machines (pLRF-ELM) is proposed for respiratory motion prediction. All the existing respiratory motion prediction methods model the non-stationary respiratory motion traces directly to predict the future values. Unlike these existing methods, the pLRF-ELM performs prediction by modeling the higher-level features obtained by mapping the raw respiratory motion into the random feature space of ELM instead of directly modeling the raw respiratory motion. The developed method is evaluated using the dataset acquired from 31 patients for two horizons in-line with the latencies of treatment systems like CyberKnife. Results showed that pLRF-ELM is superior to that of existing prediction methods.

It utilizes the data nearby the users to provide real-time, energy-efficient, and reliable services. Neural network inference in edge computing is a powerful tool for various applications. However, edge server will collect more personal sensitive information of users inevitably. It is the most basic requirement for users to ensure their security and privacy while obtaining accurate inference results. Homomorphic encryption (HE) technology is confidential computing that directly performs mathematical computing on encrypted data. But it only can carry out limited addition and multiplication operation with very low efficiency. Intel software guard extension (SGX) can provide a trusted isolation space in the CPU to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of code and data executed. But several defects are hard to overcome due to hardware design limitations when applying SGX in inference services. This paper proposes a hybrid framework utilizing SGX to accelerate the HE-based convolutional neural network (CNN) inference, eliminating the approximation operations in HE to improve inference accuracy in theory. Besides, SGX is also taken as a built-in trusted third party to distribute keys, thereby improving our framework's scalability and flexibility.

Due to the diversity of user equipments (UEs), the live streaming has to be transcoded as different versions. However, transcoding is a computationally expensive and time consuming process. Since the shortage of computational resources and unstable of wireless networks, providing strict delay requirement and high quality live videos for wireless UEs is a big challenge. In this paper, we investigate user scheduling, transcoding decision, computational and wireless spectrum resources allocation problem in software-defined networking (SDN) based cloud-aided of heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Our research focuses on improving UEs' quality of experience (QoE) while guaranteeing time-delay requirement for live streaming services. Different from existing literature, to approach the real wireless environment, the available computational and wireless spectrum resources are modeled as random processes in our research. Considering dynamic characteristics of wireless networks and the available resources, the above problem is modeled as a Markov decision problem (MDP). Since the action space of the MDP is multi-dimensional continuous variables mixed with discrete variables, traditional learning algorithms are powerless. Therefore, an online actor critic algorithm is proposed to resolve the problem.

Less attention, however, has been paid to the resilience of these machine learning algorithms when implemented on real hardware and subjected to unintentional and/or malicious errors during execution, such as those occurring from space-based single event upsets (SEU). This paper presents a series of results quantifying the rate and level of performance degradation that occurs when convolutional neural nets (CNNs) are subjected to selected bit errors in single-precision number representations. This paper provides results that are conditioned upon ten different error case events to isolate the impacts showing that CNN performance can be gradually degraded or reduced to random guessing based on where errors arise. The degradations are then translated into expected operational lifetimes for each of four CNNs when deployed to space radiation environments. The discussion also provides a foundation for ongoing research that enhances the overall resilience of neural net architectures and implementations in space under both random and malicious error events, offering significant improvements over current implementations.

10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252422,Query based hybrid learning models for adaptively adjusting locality,IEEE,Conferences,"Local learning employs locality adjusting mechanisms to give local function estimation for each query, while global learning tries to capture the global distribution characteristics of the entire training set. When fitting well with local characteristics of each individual region, the locality parameter may help local learning to improve performance. However, the real data distribution is impossible to get for a real-world problem, and thus an optimal locality is hard to get for each query. In addition, it is quite time-consuming to build an independent local model for each query. To solve these problems, we present strategies for estimating and tuning locality according to local distribution. Based on local distribution estimation, global learning and local learning are combined to achieve a good compromise between capacity and locality. In addition, multi-objective learning principles for the combination are also given. In implementation, a unique global model is first built on the entire training set based on empirical minimization principle. For each query, it is measured that whether the global model can well fit the vicinity space of the query. When an uneven local distribution is found, the locality of the model is tuned, and a specific local model will be built on the local region. To investigate the performance of hybrid models, we apply them to a typical learning problem-spam filtering, in which data are always found to be unevenly distributed. Experiments were conducted on five real-world corpora, namely PU1, PU2, PU3, PUA, and TREC07.

10.1109/DS-RT.2016.9,RA2: Predicting Simulation Execution Time for Cloud-Based Design Space Explorations,IEEE,Conferences,"Design space exploration refers to the evaluation of implementation alternatives for many engineering and design problems. A popular exploration approach is to run a large number of simulations of the actual system with varying sets of configuration parameters to search for the optimal ones. Due to the potentially huge resource requirements, cloud-based simulation execution strategies should be considered in many cases. In this paper, we look at the issue of running large-scale simulation-based design space exploration problems on commercial Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds, namely Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine. To efficiently manage cloud resources used for execution, the key problem would be to accurately predict the running time for each simulation instance in advance. This is not trivial due to the currently wide range of cloud resource types which offer varying levels of performance. In addition, the widespread use of virtualization techniques in most cloud providers often introduces unpredictable performance interference. In this paper, we propose a resource and application-aware (RA2) prediction approach to combat performance variability on clouds. In particular, we employ neural network based techniques coupled with non-intrusive monitoring of resource availability to obtain more accurate predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on commercial cloud platforms using an evacuation planning design problem over a month-long period. The results demonstrate that it is possible to predict simulation execution times in most cases with high accuracy. The experiments also provide some interesting insights on how we should run similar simulation problems on various commercially available clouds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7789881/,2016 IEEE/ACM 20th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT),21-23 Sept. 2016,ieeexplore

The suggested pipeline robustly completes point cloud with large missing regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train an RL agent to control the GAN, which effectively learns the highly nonlinear mapping from the input noise of the GAN to the latent space of point cloud.

In this method, an agent constructed by a Long Short-Term Memory Network aims at maximizing the expected accuracy of a machine learning model on a validation set. At each iteration, it selects a set of hyperparameters and uses the accuracy of the model on the validation set as the reward signal to update its internal parameters. After multiple iterations, the agent learns how to improve its decisions. However, the computation of the reward requires significant time and leads to low sample efficiency. To speed up training, we employ a neural network to predict the reward. The training process for the agent and the prediction network is divided into three phases: Real-Predictive-Real (RPR). First, the agent and the prediction network are trained by the real experience; then, the agent is trained by the reward generated from the prediction network; finally, the agent is trained again by the real experience. In this way, we can speed up training and make the agent achieve a high accuracy. Besides, to reduce the variance, we propose a Bootstrap Pool (BP) to guide the exploration in the search space.

Most previous methods focused on generating a single-channel output for each of the target speakers, hence discarding the spatial cues needed for the localization of sound sources in space. However, preserving the spatial information is important in many applications that aim to accurately render the acoustic scene such as in hearing aids and augmented reality (AR). Here, we propose a speech separation algorithm that preserves the interaural cues of separated sound sources and can be implemented with low latency and high fidelity, therefore enabling a real-time modification of the acoustic scene. Based on the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a single-channel time-domain speech separation system that can be implemented in real-time, we propose a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) end-to-end extension of TasNet that takes binaural mixed audio as input and simultaneously separates target speakers in both channels. Experimental results show that the proposed end-to-end MIMO system is able to significantly improve the separation performance and keep the perceived location of the modified sources intact in various acoustic scenes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053215/,"ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",4-8 May 2020,ieeexplore

In this paper we present an automated and inexpensive non-contact, vision-based method for monitoring an individual's tidal volume, which is extracted from a three-dimensional (3D) chest surface reconstruction from a single depth camera. In particular, formulating the respiration monitoring process as a 3D space-time volumetric representation, we introduce a real-time surface reconstruction algorithm to generate omni-direction deformation states of a patient's chest while breathing, which reflects the change in tidal volume over time. These deformation states are then used to estimate breathing volume through a per-patient correlation metric acquired through a Bayesian-network learning process.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554141,"Real-Time, Deep Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) Autofocus",IEEE,Conferences,"Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) requires precise time-of-flight measurements of the transmitted/received waveform to produce well-focused imagery. It is not uncommon for errors in these measurements to be present resulting in image defocusing. To overcome this, an autofocus algorithm is employed as a post-processing step after image reconstruction to improve image focus. A particular class of these algorithms can be framed as a sharpness/contrast metric-based optimization. To improve convergence, a hand-crafted weighting function to remove “bad” areas of the image is sometimes applied to the image-under-test before the optimization procedure. Additionally, dozens of iterations are necessary for convergence which is a large compute burden for low size, weight, and power (SWaP) systems. We propose a deep learning technique to overcome these limitations and implicitly learn the weighting function in a data-driven manner. Our proposed method, which we call Deep Autofocus, uses features from the single-look-complex (SLC) to estimate the phase correction which is applied in k-space. Furthermore, we train our algorithm on batches of training imagery so that during deployment, only a single iteration of our method is sufficient to autofocus. We show results demonstrating the robustness of our technique by comparing our results to four commonly used image sharpness metrics. Our results demonstrate Deep Autofocus can produce imagery perceptually better than common iterative techniques but at a lower computational cost.

It comprises of 4096 cores each core with 65K of local memory (6T SRAM)-synapses- and 256 arithmetic logic units - neurons-that operate on a unary number representation and compute by counting up to a maximum of 19 bits. The cores are event-driven using custom asynchronous and synchronous logic, and they are globally connected through an asynchronous packet switched mesh network on chip (NOC). The chip development board, includes a Zyng Xilinx FPGA that does the housekeeping and provides support for standard communication support through an Ethernet UDP interface. The asynchronous Addressed Event Representation (AER) in the NOC is al so exposed to the user for connection to AER based peripherals through a packet with bundled data full duplex interface. The unary data values represented on the system buses can take on a wide variety of spatial and temporal encoding schemes. Pulse density coding (the number of events Ne represents a number N), thermometer coding, time-slot encoding, and stochastic encoding are examples. Additional low level interfaces are available for communicating directly with the TrueNorth chip to aid programming and parameter setting. A hierarchical, compositional programming language, Corelet, is available to aid the development of TN applications. IBM provides support and a development system as well as “Compass” a scalable simulator. The software environment runs under standard Linux installations (Red Hat, CentOS and Ubuntu) and has standard interfaces to Matlab and to Caffe that is employed to train deep neural network models.

Sophisticated techniques for motion planning such as the Wavefront algorithm are limited by the high dimensionality of the configuration space, especially for robots with many degrees of freedom. For a neural implementation of the Wavefront algorithm in the configuration space, neurons represent discrete configurations and synapses are used for path planning. In order to decrease the complexity, we reduce the search space by pruning superfluous neurons and synapses. We present different models of self-organizing neural networks for this reduction. The approach takes real-life human motion data as input and creates a representation with reduced dimension. We compare six different neural network models and adapt the Wavefront algorithm to the different structures of the reduced output spaces. The method is backed up by an extensive evaluation of the reduced spaces, including their suitability for path planning by the Wavefront algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9536145/,2021 6th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM),3-5 July 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690917,Refined Autoencoder-Based CSI Hidden Feature Extraction for Indoor Spot Localization,IEEE,Conferences,"Wireless indoor localization technique has attracted wide attention recently. Fingerprint (FP) based method with received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is a popular approach due to easy implementation and robustness. Nowadays, fine-grained indoor spot localization resort to channel state information (CSI) owing to rich information property of CSI. However, due to a higher dimension of CSI compared to RSSI, CSI-based FP method requires higher storage and communication overhead, which is not suitable for most scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel refined autoencoder-based CSI hidden feature extraction for indoor spot localization (RACHEL). Based on the concept of FP, we first introduce an autoencoder (AE) for the dimension reduction and feature discrimination. A low dimensional hidden feature of trained AE model is saved as FP database in the off-line stage. For indoor spot localization problems, users position is assumed to be close to one of the reference points. Therefore, CSI transforms to hidden feature space and users location is estimated by the nearest-neighbor algorithm in the on-line stage. Furthermore, to enhance the performance, instinctive AE is modified by considering corruption from time-varying environment and sensitivity between the hidden layer and input layer. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed RACHEL can achieve 97.8% spot classification accuracy and yield a spaced savings of 94.3%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8690917/,2018 IEEE 88th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall),27-30 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore

Although general regression testing has been extensively studied, regression testing in the context of video games, especially Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), is largely untouched so far. One big challenge is that game testing requires a certain level of intelligence in generating suitable action sequences among the huge search space, to accomplish complex tasks in the MMORPG. Existing game testing mainly relies on either the manual playing or manual scripting, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Even worse, it is often unable to satisfy the frequent industrial game evolution. The recent process in machine learning brings new opportunities for automatic game playing and testing.

10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308514,Regression learning on patches,IEEE,Conferences,"Neural networks often do poorly at representing dis-continuous functions, or even just functions with rapid transitions in the response surface between closely-spaced points in feature space. However, such `edges' in the data can be a useful way to partition the feature space in order to train specialised learners for individual regions. This is particularly beneficial where these regions are relatively simple, and hence low-complexity learners can be used successfully on them. Another benefit of such an approach is that it is easily parallelisable: the specialised learners use independent partitions of the data, and so they can be trained in parallel, while output prediction is based on the output of just one network, so there is no need to combine predictions. We introduce an algorithm to partition the data that is inspired by Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting. Using an implementation based on a decision tree with neural networks at the leaves, we demonstrate our approach for regression learning on patches of the feature space. We use both artificial and real-world datasets to show that, in some use cases, this method can outperform conventional neural networks that see the entire feature set in the original training.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308514/,2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),1-4 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ISGTAsia49270.2021.9715603,Reinforcement Learning Based EV Charging Scheduling: A Novel Action Space Representation,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, several optimization techniques have been proposed for electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling. A common approach to intelligent scheduling is day-ahead planning, assuming full arrival time, departure time and energy demand knowledge or having them forecasted. However, the result from the day-ahead scheduling is limitedly applicable due to the uncertainties from the charging behaviors. With the deployment of the EV charging communication protocol defined in ISO 15118, it is realistic to assume that the EV will publish the departure time and the energy demand upon arrival. Thus, real-time scheduling, making decisions at each decision timeslot, can adapt to the new information and increase scheduling performance. Traditional model-based approaches like model predictive control (MPC) still require models, for example, for the future arrival times to solve the scheduling problem. Reinforcement learning (RL), a model-free approach, has also been successfully applied to real-time scheduling. RL can learn how to make decisions without relying on any system knowledge. This paper proposes a new action space construction method for an RL as proposed in a preceding work. The resulting action space size is significantly reduced compared to the original approach. Further, we compare the performance of a novel prioritized RL method to the original method. A publicly available charging session dataset is used for performance comparison in contrast to the original method.

10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9249227,Reinforcement Learning with Converging Goal Space and Binary Reward Function,IEEE,Conferences,"Usage of a sparse and binary reward function remains one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning. In particular, when the environments wherein robotic agents learn are sufficiently vast, it is much more difficult to learn tasks because the probability of reaching the goal is minimal. A Hindsight Experience Replay algorithm was proposed to overcome these difficulties; however, problems persist that affect the learning speed and delay learning when a learning agent cannot receive proper rewards at the beginning of the learning process. In this paper, we present a simple method called Converging Goal Space and Binary Reward Function, which helps agents learn tasks easily and efficiently in large environments while providing a binary reward. At an early stage in training, a larger goal space margin facilitates the reward function for a more rapid policy learning. As the number of successes increases, the goal space is gradually reduced to the size used to the size used in the test. We apply this reward function to two different task experiments: sliding and throwing, which must be explored at a wider range than the reach of the robotic arms, and then compare the learning efficiency to that of experiments that only employ a sparse and binary reward function. We show that the proposed reward function performs better in large environments using physics simulation, and we demonstrate that the function is applicable to real world robotic arms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9249227/,2020 IEEE 16th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),20-21 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

Based on this idea, a dynamic margin (DM) translation principle is proposed in this paper, and by introducing this principle into the classical TransE model, a knowledge graph embedding model named TransE-DM is presented.

As the space of sensorimotor data available to a conventional or machine learning prosthetic control system increases in dimensionality and complexity, it becomes increasingly important that this data be represented in a useful and computationally efficient way. Well structured sensory data allows prosthetic control systems to make informed, appropriate control decisions. In this study, we explore the impact that increased sensorimotor information has on current machine learning prosthetic control approaches. Specifically, we examine the effect that high-dimensional sensory data has on the computation time and prediction performance of a true-online temporal-difference learning prediction method as embedded within a resource-limited upper-limb prosthesis control system. We present results comparing tile coding, the dominant linear representation for real-time prosthetic machine learning, with a newly proposed modification to Kanerva coding that we call selective Kanerva coding. In addition to showing promising results for selective Kanerva coding, our results confirm potential limitations to tile coding as the number of sensory input dimensions increases. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explicitly examine representations for realtime machine learning prosthetic devices in general terms.

In order to speed up tracking, we improve the traditional method by adding motion prediction, which works better when several disturbing objects appear simultaneously. Finally we make the tracking region blurring and transmit the frames to the remote collaborative sites to obtain the privacy protection.

10.1109/DSAA.2016.32,Reserve Price Optimization at Scale,IEEE,Conferences,"Online advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry largely responsible for keeping most online content free and content creators (""publishers"") in business. In one aspect of advertising sales, impressions are auctioned off in second price auctions on an auction-by-auction basis through what is known as real-time bidding (RTB). An important mechanism through which publishers can influence how much revenue they earn is reserve pricing in RTB auctions. The optimal reserve price problem is well studied in both applied and academic literatures. However, few solutions are suited to RTB, where billions of auctions for ad space on millions of different sites and Internet users are conducted each day among bidders with heterogenous valuations. In particular, existing solutions are not robust to violations of assumptions common in auction theory and do not scale to processing terabytes of data each hour, a high dimensional feature space, and a fast changing demand landscape. In this paper, we describe a scalable, online, real-time, incrementally updated reserve price optimizer for RTB that is currently implemented as part of the AppNexus Publisher Suite. Our solution applies an online learning approach, maximizing a custom cost function suited to reserve price optimization. We demonstrate the scalability and feasibility with the results from the reserve price optimizer deployed in a production environment. In the production deployed optimizer, the average revenue lift was 34.4% with 95% confidence intervals (33.2%, 35.6%) from more than 8 billion auctions over 46 days, a substantial increase over non-optimized and often manually set rule based reserve prices.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7796939/,2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA),17-19 Oct. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00028,Resource-Guided Configuration Space Reduction for Deep Learning Models,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep learning models, like traditional software systems, provide a large number of configuration options. A deep learning model can be configured with different hyperparameters and neural architectures. Recently, AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) has been widely adopted to automate model training by systematically exploring diverse configurations. However, current AutoML approaches do not take into consideration the computational constraints imposed by various resources such as available memory, computing power of devices, or execution time. The training with non-conforming configurations could lead to many failed AutoML trial jobs or inappropriate models, which cause significant resource waste and severely slow down development productivity. In this paper, we propose DnnSAT, a resource-guided AutoML approach for deep learning models to help existing AutoML tools efficiently reduce the configuration space ahead of time. DnnSAT can speed up the search process and achieve equal or even better model learning performance because it excludes trial jobs not satisfying the constraints and saves resources for more trials. We formulate the resource-guided configuration space reduction as a constraint satisfaction problem. DnnSAT includes a unified analytic cost model to construct common constraints with respect to the model weight size, number of floating-point operations, model inference time, and GPU memory consumption. It then utilizes an SMT solver to obtain the satisfiable configurations of hyperparameters and neural architectures. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of DnnSAT in accelerating state-of-the-art AutoML methods (Hyperparameter Optimization and Neural Architecture Search) with an average speedup from 1.19X to 3.95X on public benchmarks. We believe that DnnSAT can make AutoML more practical in a real-world environment with constrained resources.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402095/,2021 IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),22-30 May 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678889,Restoring the Executability of Jupyter Notebooks by Automatic Upgrade of Deprecated APIs,IEEE,Conferences,"Data scientists typically practice exploratory programming using computational notebooks, to comprehend new data and extract insights. To do this they iteratively refine their code, actively trying to re-use and re-purpose solutions created by other data scientists, in real time. However, recent studies have shown that a vast majority of publicly available notebooks cannot be executed out of the box. One of the prominent reasons is the deprecation of data science APIs used in such notebooks, due to the rapid evolution of data science libraries. In this work we propose RELANCER, an automatic technique that restores the executability of broken Jupyter Notebooks, in near real time, by upgrading deprecated APIs. RELANCER employs an iterative runtime-error-driven approach to identify and fix one API issue at a time. This is supported by a machine-learned model which uses the runtime error message to predict the kind of API repair needed - an update in the API or package name, a parameter, or a parameter value. Then RELANCER creates a search space of candidate repairs by combining knowledge from API migration examples on GitHub as well as the API documentation and employs a second machine-learned model to rank this space of candidate mappings. An evaluation of RELANCER on a curated dataset of 255 un-executable Jupyter Notebooks from Kaggle shows that RELANCER can successfully restore the executability of 56% of the subjects, while baselines relying on just GitHub examples and just API documentation can only fix 38% and 36% of the subjects respectively. Further, pursuant to its real-time use case, RELANCER can restore execution to 49% of subjects, within a 5 minute time limit, while a baseline lacking its machine learning models can only fix 24%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9678889/,2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE),15-19 Nov. 2021,ieeexplore

Recent works have built a great deal of deep learning models to address this task. However, these approaches mostly rely on significant architecture engineering and suffer from high computational burden. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Retinex-inspired Unrolling with Architecture Search (RUAS), to construct lightweight yet effective enhancement network for low-light images in real-world scenario. Specifically, building upon Retinex rule, RUAS first establishes models to characterize the intrinsic underexposed structure of low-light images and unroll their optimization processes to construct our holistic propagation structure. Then by designing a cooperative reference-free learning strategy to discover low-light prior architectures from a compact search space, RUAS is able to obtain a top-performing image enhancement network, which is with fast speed and requires few computational resources.

However, most existing learning algorithms are overcomplex to enable real-time learning on IoT devices with limited resources and computing power. Recently, Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is introduced as an alternative computing paradigm for enabling efficient and robust learning. HDC emulates the cognitive task by representing the values as patterns of neural activity in high-dimensional space. HDC first encodes all data points to high-dimensional vectors. It then efficiently performs the learning task using a well-defined set of operations. Existing HDC solutions have two main issues that hinder their deployments on low-power embedded devices: (i) the encoding module is costly, dominating 80% of the entire training performance, (ii) the HDC model size and the computation cost grow significantly with the number of classes in online inference.In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture, LookHD, which enables real-time HDC learning on low-power edge devices. LookHD exploits computation reuse to memorize the encoding module and simplify its computation with single memory access. LookHD also address the inference scalability by exploiting HDC governing mathematics that compresses the HDC trained model into a single hypervector. We present how the proposed architecture can be implemented on the existing low power architectures: ARM processor and FPGA design. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach on a wide range of practical classification problems such as activity recognition, face recognition, and speech recognition. Our evaluations show that LookHD can achieve, on average, $ 28.3\times$ faster and $ 97.4\times$ more energy-efficient training as compared to the state-of-the-art HDC implemented on the FPGA. Similarly, in the inference, LookHD is $ 2.2\times$ faster, $ 4.1\times$ more energy-efficient, and has $ 6.3\times$ smaller model size than the same state-of-the-art algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9407181/,2021 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA),27 Feb.-3 March 2021,ieeexplore

For such an autonomous system one of the requisites is that the goal has to be achieved without intervention of human being. We present a practical implementation of autonomous robotic navigation based on logic-based planning. We achieve this by using strength of PROLOG in order to generate plan to reach goal position from an initial. We utilize First Order Logic (FOL) that automatically asserts and retracts facts at runtime dynamically. All possible plans are computed using local search strategies (e.g., Depth and Breadth First) on state space representing a real, dynamic, and unpredictable environment. In order to navigate in the environment following optimized plan - one with fewest states, a balanced size 4-wheel differential drive robot has been carefully constructed. It can turn 90° and actuate forward by controlling linear (ν<inf>t</inf> = 0.25m/s) and angular (ω<inf>t</inf> = Π/8 rad/s) velocities of two rear motorized wheels. It is also equipped with an Ultrasonic sensor to avoid collision with obstacles. The system is evaluated in an environment comprising of corridors with adjacent rooms. Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed in .Net (C#) to map situation in Prolog and transmit plan to hardware for execution. Average time calculated for a plan to generate is 0.065 seconds.

10.1109/ICDE.2019.00128,Robust High Dimensional Stream Classification with Novel Class Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"A primary challenge in label prediction over a data stream is the emergence of instances belonging to unknown or novel class over time. Traditionally, studies addressing this problem aim to detect such instances using cluster-based mechanisms. They typically assume that instances from the same class are closer to each other than those belonging to different classes in observed feature space. Unfortunately, this may not hold true in higher-dimensional feature space such as images. In recent years, Convolutional neural network (CNN) have emerged as a leading system to be employed in many real-world application. Yet, based on the assumption of closed world dataset with a fixed number of categories, CNN lacks robustness for novel class detection, so it is unclear on how such models can be used to deal with novel class instances along a high-dimensional image stream. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by proposing an effective learning framework called CNN-based Prototype Ensemble (CPE) for novel class detection and correction. Our framework includes a prototype ensemble loss (PE) to improve the intra-class compactness and expand inter-class separateness in the output feature representation, thereby enabling the robustness of novel class detection. Moreover, we provide an incremental learning strategy which maintains a constant amount of exemplars to update the network, making it more practical for real-world application. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing its performance over multiple realworld image benchmark data streams with existing state-of-theart data stream detection techniques.

Such a mapping is estimated with either a convolution neural network or a decision tree using only the static input image sequence, which makes these approaches vulnerable to dynamic indoor environments that are quite common yet challenging in the real world. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel outlier-aware neural tree which bridges the two worlds, deep learning and decision tree approaches. It builds on three important blocks: (a) a hierarchical space partition over the indoor scene to construct the decision tree; (b) a neural routing function, implemented as a deep classification network, employed for better 3D scene understanding; and (c) an outlier rejection module used to filter out dynamic points during the hierarchical routing process.

As an essential low-level preprocessing stage, a deraining network should clear the rain streaks and preserve the fine semantic details. However, most existing methods only consider low-level image restoration. That limits their performances at high-level tasks requiring precise semantic information. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a segmentation aware progressive network (SAPNet) based upon contrastive learning for single image deraining. We start our method with a lightweight derain network formed with progressive dilated units (PDU). The PDU can significantly expand the receptive field and characterize multiscale rain streaks without the heavy computation on multiscale images. A fundamental aspect of this work is an unsupervised background segmentation (UBS) network initialized with ImageNet and Gaussian weights. The UBS can faithfully preserve an image s semantic information and improve the generalization ability to unseen photos. Furthermore, we introduce a perceptual contrastive loss (PCL) and a learned perceptual image similarity loss (LPISL) to regulate model learning. By ex-ploiting the rainy image and ground-truth as the negative and the positive sample in the VGG-16 latent space, we bridge the fine semantic details between the derained image and the ground-truth in a fully constrained manner. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy images show our model surpasses top-performing methods and aids object detection and semantic segmentation with considerable efficacy.

Two different approaches are presented based on SMOS brightness temperature and SMOS neural network soil moisture data assimilation, respectively. For the first approach, SMOS brightness temperature data assimilation relies on forward modelling. Long term results, spanning the SMOS period, of SMOS forward modelling, monitoring and data assimilation are presented. They emphasize the relevance of SMOS data for monitoring and to support NWP model developments. For the second approach, a SMOS soil moisture product has been produced based on a Neural Network (NN) trained on ECMWF soil moisture. So, the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product captures the SMOS signal variability in time and space, while by design its climatology is consistent with that of the ECMWF soil moisture, which makes it suitable for data assimilation purpose. This approach, initially tested for 2012 in a global scale stand alone approach, shows that SMOS NN data assimilation slightly improves the two-metre air temperature forecast in the short range at regional scale. For NWP applications this approach has been further developed with a near real time production of the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product, with the implementation of the SMOS NN data assimilation in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and with high resolution (9km) global scale testing compatible with the current ECMWF NWP system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8519369/,IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,22-27 July 2018,ieeexplore

However, due to the real nonstationary ECG noise environment, it is still challenging to perform this technique robustly and precisely. In this paper, we propose a novel ECG biometrics framework named robuSt semanTic spacE leaRning with Local sImilarity preserviNG (STERLING) to learn a latent space where ECG signals can be robustly and discriminatively represented with semantic information and local structure being preserved. Specifically, in the proposed framework, a novel loss function is proposed to learn robust semantic representation by introducing l<inf>2,1</inf>-norm loss and making full use of the supervised information. In addition, a graph regularization is imposed to preserve the local structure information in each subject. Finally, in the learnt latent space, matching can be effectively done.

Many pattern recognition problems, such as handwriting/sketching recognition and speech recognition, are user dependent since different users' handwritings, drawing styles, and accents are different. Hence, the classifiers for solving these problems should provide the functionality of user adaptation so as to let all users experience better recognition results. However, the user adaptation functionality requires the classifiers have the incremental learning ability in order to learn fast. In this paper, an SVM-based incremental active learning algorithm is presented to solve this problem. By utilizing the support vectors and only a small portion of the nonsupport vectors as well, in addition to the new interrogative samples, in the iterative training and reclassification cycle, both the training time and the storage space are saved with only very little classification precision being lost.

Since GPs are fully determined by their mean and covariance functions, we are able to obtain predictive uncertainty estimates at the cost of a single forward pass through any chosen CNN architecture and for any supervised learning task. By leveraging the structure of the induced covariance matrices, we propose numerically efficient algorithms which enable fast training in the context of high-dimensional tasks such as depth estimation and semantic segmentation.

It has been widely used in many applications such as face and object recognitions. The optimal basis of OCA is obtained through solving an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold. However, one limitation of OCA is the computational cost becoming heavy when the number of training data is large, which prevents OCA from efficiently applying in many real applications. In this paper, a scalable OCA (S-OCA) that uses a two-stage strategy is developed to bridge this gap. In the first stage, we cluster the training data using K-means algorithm and the dimension of data is reduced into a low dimensional space. In the second stage, OCA search is performed in the reduced space and the gradient is updated using an numerical approximation. In the process of OCA gradient updating, instead of choosing the entire training data, S-OCA randomly chooses a small subset of the training images in each class to update the gradient. This achieves stochastic gradient updating and at the same time reduces the searching time of OCA in orders of magnitude. Experimental results on face and object datasets show efficiency of the S-OCA method, in term of both classification accuracy and computational complexity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4457247/,Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007),13-15 Dec. 2007,ieeexplore

Additionally, the dimensionality of the action manifold is lower than that of the state manifold, whose intrinsically correlated states are more difficult to capture in a learned manner.

Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults.

Although standard anomaly detection methods usually assume that instances are independent and identically distributed, in many real-world applications, instances are often explicitly connected, resulting in so-called attributed graphs. The proposed method embeds nodes (instances) on the attributed graph in a latent space by taking into account their attributes as well as the graph structure on the basis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). To learn node embeddings specialized for anomaly detection, in which there is a class imbalance due to the rarity of anomalies, the parameters of a GCN are trained to minimize the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the node embeddings of normal instances while embedding anomalous ones outside the hypersphere. This enables us to detect anomalies by simply calculating the distances between the node embeddings and hypersphere center. The proposed method can effectively propagate label information on a small amount of nodes to unlabeled ones by taking into account the node's attributes, graph structure, and class imbalance. In experiments with five real-world attributed graph datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms various existing anomaly detection methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9533507/,2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),18-22 July 2021,ieeexplore

Therefore, newly discovered vulnerabilities, especially those without an available patch, represent the largest problem.

Linking the same users across different social networks, also known as social network alignment, is a critical task of great research challenges. Many existing works usually focus on finding a projection function from one subspace to another for network alignment, however, the projection functions proposed in their papers are independent and updated individually, which could not effectively exploit the non-parallel data, and yield inferior alignment performance. In this paper, we propose a Shared-latent Variable Network Alignment (SVNA) architecture to effectively exploit the non-parallel data for network alignment, and jointly train projection functions and decoders in a unified framework with the shared latent variable z. Specifically, SVNA first employs the graph convolutional networks to preserve the structural information of the network. By introducing the shared latent variable z, SVNA simultaneously integrates two projection functions and two decoders for jointly training. Both projection functions and decoders share the same latent space, therefore both projection directions can learn from the non-parallel data more effectively. Thereafter, SVNA utilizes the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to further train the projection functions, and adopts a probability-based semi-supervised method to achieve the network alignment.

The block diagram of the decentralized control subsystems with the radial basis control NNs for the ""fast"" and ""intermediate"" subsystems, and with one linear layer control NN for the ""slow"" subsystem is designed.

10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851808,Skip-GANomaly: Skip Connected and Adversarially Trained Encoder-Decoder Anomaly Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"Despite inherent ill-definition, anomaly detection is a research endeavour of great interest within machine learning and visual scene understanding alike. Most commonly, anomaly detection is considered as the detection of outliers within a given data distribution based on some measure of normality. The most significant challenge in real-world anomaly detection problems is that available data is highly imbalanced towards normality (i.e. non-anomalous) and contains at most a sub-set of all possible anomalous samples - hence limiting the use of well-established supervised learning methods. By contrast, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model, trained only on the normal (non-anomalous, plentiful) samples in order to learn the normality distribution of the domain, and hence detect abnormality based on deviation from this model. Our proposed approach employs an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with skip connections to thoroughly capture the multi-scale distribution of the normal data distribution in image space. Furthermore, utilizing an adversarial training scheme for this chosen architecture provides superior reconstruction both within image space and a lower-dimensional embedding vector space encoding. Minimizing the reconstruction error metric within both the image and hidden vector spaces during training aids the model to learn the distribution of normality as required. Higher reconstruction metrics during subsequent test and deployment are thus indicative of a deviation from this normal distribution, hence indicative of an anomaly. Experimentation over established anomaly detection benchmarks and challenging real-world datasets, within the context of X-ray security screening, shows the unique promise of such a proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8851808/,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 July 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICITECH.2017.8079996,Sliding Recursive Hierarchical Adaptive PCA for 3D image processing,IEEE,Conferences,"Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is the basic approach for processing of 3D tensor images (for example, multi- and hyper-spectral, multi-view, computer tomography, video, etc.). As a result of their processing, the information redundancy is significantly reduced. This is of high importance for their efficient compression and for the reduction of the features space needed, when object recognition is performed. The basic obstacle for the wide application of PCA, is the high computational complexity. One of the approaches, used to overcome the problem, is to use algorithms, based on the recursive PCA. The well-known methods for recursive PCA are aimed at the processing of sequences of images, represented as non-overlapping groups of vectors. In the last several years, the interest towards the recursive PCA for 3D tensor images executed in sliding temporal window, was significantly increased. Such analysis is needed, for example for the convolution tensor decomposition in multi-layer neural networks, in the systems for 3D noise filtration, video compression, etc. In this work is proposed new method, called Sliding Recursive Hierarchical Adaptive PCA (SR-HAPCA), based on the HAPCA algorithm. The method SR-HAPCA retains all advantages of HAPCA towards the PCA: it decreases the number of calculations needed, and permits parallel implementation. Besides, the lower computational complexity of SR-HAPCA makes easier its application in real-time processing of 3D tensor images.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8079996/,2017 8th International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT),17-18 May 2017,ieeexplore

This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls. The author has built a specialized laboratory to investigate machine learning technology applied to autonomous systems. In this laboratory miniature autonomous vehicles are developed.

To remedy this, we propose a novel integration into ROS of smart pointers and synchronisation primitives stored in shared memory. These obey the same semantics and, more importantly, exhibit the same performance as their C++ standard library counterparts, making them preferable to other local IPC mechanisms. We present a series of benchmarks for our mechanism - which we call LOT (Low Overhead Transport) - and use them to assess its performance on realistic data loads based on Five’s Autonomous Vehicle (AV) system, and extend our analysis to the case where multiple ROS nodes are running in Docker containers.

We show how to exploit information about data sources to significantly improve matching accuracy. In particular, we observe that different sources often vary substantially in their level of semantic ambiguity, thus requiring different matching techniques. In addition, it is often beneficial to group and match mentions in related sources first, before considering other sources. These observations lead to a large space of matching strategies, analogous to the space of query evaluation plans considered by a relational optimizer. We propose viewing entity matching as a composition of basic steps into a ""match execution plan"". We analyze formal properties of the plan space, and show how to find a good match plan.

While different solutions have been proposed to support nearest neighbor queries on encrypted data, these existing solutions still encounter critical drawbacks either in efficiency or privacy. In light of the limitations in the current literature, we propose a novel approximate nearest neighbor search solution, referred to as Sparser, by leveraging a combination of space-filling curves, perturbation, and Order-Preserving Encryption. The advantages of Sparser are twofold, strengthening privacy and improving efficiency. Specifically, Sparser pre-processes plaintext data with space-filling curves and perturbation, such that data is sparse, which mitigates leakage abuse attacks and renders stronger privacy. In addition to privacy enhancement, Sparser can efficiently find approximate nearest neighbors over encrypted data with logarithmic time.

Sparse representation of data is one giant leap toward the search for a solution for big data analysis. The focus of our paper is on algorithms for sparsity-based representation of categorical data. For this, we adopt a concept from the image and signal processing domain called dictionary learning. We have successfully implemented its sparse coding stage which gives the sparse representation of data using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms (both Batch and Cholesky based) and its dictionary update stage using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We have also used a preprocessing stage where we represent the categorical dataset using a vector space model based on the TF-IDF weighting scheme. Our paper demonstrates how input data can be decomposed and approximated as a linear combination of minimum number of elementary columns of a dictionary which so formed will be a compact representation of data. Classification or clustering algorithms can now be easily performed based on the generated sparse coded coefficient matrix or based on the dictionary.

The spatiotemporal orientation detector discussed is based on Adelson and Bergen's model with modifications to accommodate the computational limitations of hardware analog neural networks. The analog neural computer used here has the unique property of offering temporal computational capabilities through synaptic time-constants. These time-constants are crucial for implementing the spatiotemporal filters. Analysis, implementation and performance of the motion filters are discussed. The performance of the neural motion filters is found to be consistent with theoretical predictions and the real stimulus motion.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/374437/,Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94),28 June-2 July 1994,ieeexplore

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The amount of data generated and collected across computing platforms every day is not only enormous, but growing at an exponential rate. Advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques have become increasingly essential to analyze and extract meaning from such “Big Data”. These techniques can be very useful to detect patterns and trends to improve the operational behavior of computing systems, but they also introduce a number of outstanding challenges: (1) How can we design and deploy data analytics mechanisms to improve energy-efficiency and reliability in IoT and mobile devices, without introducing significant software overheads? (2) How to leverage emerging technologies (e.g.,3D integration) to design energy-efficient and reliable manycore systems for big data computing? (3) How to use machine learning and data mining techniques for effective design space exploration of computing systems, and enable adaptive control to improve energy-efficiency? (4) How can data analytics detect anomalies and increase robustness in the network backbone of emerging large-scale networking systems? To address these outstanding challenges, out-of-the-box approaches need to be explored. In this special session, we will discuss these outstanding problems and describe far-reaching solutions applicable across the interconnected ecosystem of IoT and mobile devices, manycore chips, datacenters, and networks. The special session brings together speakers with unique insights on applying data analytics and machine learning to real-world problems to achieve the most sought after features on multi-scale computing platforms, viz. intelligent data mining, energyefficiency, and robustness. By integrating data analytics and machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, embedded hardware and software design, and cloud computing content, this session will engage a broad section of Embedded and VLSI Design conference attendees. This special session is targeted towards university researchers/professors, students, industry professionals, and embedded/VLSI system designers. This session will attract newcomers who want to learn how to apply data analytics to solve problems in computing systems, as well as experienced researchers looking for exciting new directions in embedded systems, VLSI design, EDA algorithms, and multi-scale computing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8326889/,2018 31st International Conference on VLSI Design and 2018 17th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID),6-10 Jan. 2018,ieeexplore

Workflow management solutions (WMS) are a standard method for reducing the complexity of application deployment on high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. We introduce the design for a middleware system that extends and combines the functionality from existing solutions in order to create a high-level, staged usercentric operation/deployment model. This design addresses the requirements of several use cases in the life sciences, with a focus on neuroscience. In this manuscript we focus on two use cases: 1) three coupled neuronal simulators (for three different space/time scales) with in-transit visualization and 2) a closed-loop workflow optimized by machine learning, coupling a robot with a neural network simulation. We provide a detailed overview of the application-integrated monitoring in relationship with the HPC job.

10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8902815,"State Space Models with Dynamical and Sparse Variances, and Inference by EM Message Passing",IEEE,Conferences,"Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a probabilistic approach to estimation problems based on representing sparsity-promoting priors by Normals with Unknown Variances. This representation blends well with linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs). However, in classical SBL the unknown variances are a priori independent, which is not suited for modeling group sparse signals, or signals whose variances have structure. To model signals with, e.g., exponentially decaying or piecewise-constant (in particular block-sparse) variances, we propose SSMs with dynamical and sparse variances (SSM-DSV). These are two-layer SSMs, where the bottom layer models physical signals, and the top layer models dynamical variances that are subject to abrupt changes. Inference and learning in these hierarchical models is performed with a message passing version of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which is a special instance of the more general class of variational message passing algorithms. We validated the proposed model and estimation algorithm with two applications, using both simulated and real data. First, we implemented a block-outlier insensitive Kalman smoother by modeling the disturbance process with a SSM-DSV. Second, we used SSM-DSV to model the oculomotor system and employed EM-message passing for estimating neural controller signals from eye position data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8902815/,2019 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),2-6 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00022,State Summarization of Video Streams for Spatiotemporal Query Matching in Complex Event Processing,IEEE,Conferences,"Modelling complex events in unstructured data like videos not only requires detecting objects but also the spatiotemporal relationships among objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems discretize continuous streams into fixed batches using windows and apply operators over these batches to detect patterns in real-time. To this end, we apply CEP techniques over video streams to identify spatiotemporal patterns by capturing window state. This work introduces a novel problem where an input video stream is converted to a stream of graphs which are aggregated to a single graph over a given state. Incoming video frames are converted to a timestamped Video Event Knowledge Graph (VEKG) [1] that maps objects to nodes and captures spatiotemporal relationships among object nodes. Objects coexist across multiple frames which leads to the creation of redundant nodes and edges at different time instances that results in high memory usage. There is a need for expressive and storage efficient graph model which can summarize graph streams in a single view. We propose Event Aggregated Graph (EAG), a summarized graph representation of VEKG streams over a given state. EAG captures different spatiotemporal relationships among objects using an Event Adjacency Matrix without replicating the nodes and edges across time instances. These enable the CEP system to process multiple continuous queries and perform frequent spatiotemporal pattern matching computations over a single summarised graph. Initial experiments show EAG takes 68.35% and 28.9% less space compared to baseline and state of the art graph summarization method respectively. EAG takes 5X less search time to detect pattern as compare to VEKG stream.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8999043/,2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA),16-19 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

The use of statistics allows us to extend the search space to include richer set of features, including many which are not Boolean. Search and model selection are integrated into a single process, allowing information criteria native to the statistical model, for example logistic regression, to make feature selection decisions in a step-wise manner.

10.1109/ITSC.2015.83,Steady-State Signal Control for Urban Traffic Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"A typical reason of local traffic congestion is that the distribution of traffic flows in the network is unbalanced, i.e., traffic congestion occurs in some links, but there is still enough space not being sufficiently utilized in other links. Therefore, the consensus notion, extensively investigated in multi-agent networks, is introduced in traffic control, and the steady-state signal control approach is presented, the idea behind which is that traffic states in network links asymptotically converge to given steady-state values, implying balanced distribution of traffic flows is realized. A signal control model of the network is first proposed, which is a linear time-varying system with discharging proportions of internal network links as control variables. Furthermore, analytic relation between steady-state values and inputs of the network is established based on matrix theory, based on which the steady-state signal control law is provided, balancing time-varying traffic flows in the network. At last, simulation investigations are conducted in VISSIM software, compared with fixed-time signal control approach in a real-world topological network in Beijing of China, which shows that the proposed signal control approach can improve performance indices of the network and then reduce local traffic congestion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7313175/,2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems,15-18 Sept. 2015,ieeexplore

Further, the complexity is inflated by ensuring that each of these agent policies is coordinated into a cohesive team strategy. Finally, peaking the complexity, is evaluating the performance of the team's strategy against other teams' strategies in real-time. This is the work of this paper, proposing SIMAMT, the simulation space for multi-agent multi-team engagements, and testing it.

10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00171,Streaming Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for Continuous-Time Temporal Graph Modeling,IEEE,Conferences,"Dynamic graphs are suitable for modeling structured data that evolve over time and have been widely used in many application scenarios such as social networks, financial transaction networks, and recommendation systems. Recently, many dynamic graph methods are proposed to deal with temporal networks. However, due to the limitations of storage space and computational efficiency, most approaches evolve node representations by aggregating the latest state information of neighbor nodes, thus losing a lot of information about neighbor nodes’ state changes. Besides, high computational complexity makes it challenging to deploy dynamic graph algorithms in real-time. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel streaming dynamic graph neural network (SDGNN) for modeling continuous-time temporal graphs, which can fully capture the state changes of neighbors and reduce the computational complexity of inference. Under SDGNN, an incremental update component is designed to incrementally update node representation based on the interaction sequence, an inference component is utilized for specific downstream tasks, and a message propagation component is employed to propagate interactive information to the influenced nodes by considering the update time interval, position distance, and influence strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by capturing more state change information and efficient parallelization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679075/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),7-10 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

Our preliminary exploration shows that (1) adversarial examples are pervasively distributed in the finely divided space defined by such coverage criteria, while available natural samples are very sparse, and as a consequence, (2) previously reported fault-detection ""capabilities"" conjectured from high coverage testing are more likely due to the adversary-oriented search but not the real ""high"" coverage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8805667/,2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results (ICSE-NIER),25-31 May 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195649,SubFlow: Towards practical flow-level traffic classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Many research efforts propose the use of flow-level features (e.g., packet sizes and inter-arrival times) and machine learning algorithms to solve the traffic classification problem. However, these statistical methods have not made the anticipated impact in the real world. We attribute this to two main reasons: (a) training the classifiers and bootstrapping the system is cumbersome, (b) the resulting classifiers have limited ability to adapt gracefully as the traffic behavior changes. In this paper, we propose an approach that is easy to bootstrap and deploy, as well as robust to changes in the traffic, such as the emergence of new applications. The key novelty of our classifier is that it learns to identify the traffic of each application in isolation, instead of trying to distinguish one application from another. This is a very challenging task that hides many caveats and subtleties. To make this possible, we adapt and use subspace clustering, a powerful technique that has not been used before in this context. Subspace clustering allows the profiling of applications to be more precise by automatically eliminating irrelevant features. We show that our approach exhibits very high accuracy in classifying each application on five traces from different ISPs captured between 2005 and 2011.

10.1109/SCC.2017.68,SynAdapt: Automated Synthesis of Adaptive Agents,IEEE,Conferences,"Distributed autonomous multi-agent reasoning and classification systems have been thought of to be the basis of intelligence and have wide applications in the space of operational intelligence in closing the loop between sensing, analytics, and actions. This paper targets multi-agent systems that employ rulebased logics (i.e., rules that determine the output/response of an agent depending on the range of the input values) with pre-defined rules to accurately perceive the environment, and provide associated reactions. Such rule-based systems do not perform well in scenarios, where human generated rules cannot adapt to dynamic variations in the data distribution arising due to dynamic changes in the environment, especially if data dimensionality is very high. Examples of such scenarios exist wherever the sensed data arrives from the physical world - such as weather data, physical sensor data, human behaviour controlled data, etc. Clearly, to meet the adaptivity requirements of such scenarios we require the agents to possess adaptive reasoning capability such that they can adapt the underlying rules with respect to the changing environment. Developing such adaptive agents requires the developer to additionally possess considerable expertise of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, apart from possessing knowledge of the agent's target domain. To address the above issues, we automate the process of development and deployment of adaptive agents. We present the fundamental design concepts behind the development of SynAdapt: a new adaptive meta-learning based multi-agent synthesis framework, that automates the synthesis of adaptive multi-agent systems from high-level user specifications. SynAdapt provides the following key features: a) Automated synthesis and deployment of adaptive agents from high-level user specification, b) Agents synthesised by SynAdapt can select a learning strategy that is particularly suited for given user specifications and input dataset, and c) Agents synthesised by SynAdapt can leverage adaptive ensemble learning techniques to deal with concept drift.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8035021/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC),25-30 June 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685850,TTDeep: Time-Triggered Scheduling for Real-Time Ethernet via Deep Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Schedule scheme is essential for real-time Ethernet. Due to the inevitable change of network configurations, the solution requires to be incrementally scheduled in a timely manner. Solver-based methods are time-consuming, while handcrafted scheduling heuristics require domain knowledge and professional expertise, and their application scenarios are usually limited. Instead of designing heuristic strategy manually, we propose TTDeep, a deep reinforcement learning schedule framework, to incrementally schedule Time-Triggered (TT) flows and adapt to various topologies. Our novel framework includes 3 key designs: a period layer to capture the periodical transmission nature of TT flows, the graph neural network to extract and represent topology features, and a 3-step selection paradigm to alleviate the huge action search space issue. Comprehensive experiments show that TTDeep can schedule TT flows much faster than solver-based methods and schedule nearly twice more TT flows on average compared to handcrafted heuristics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9685850/,2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),7-11 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

Most teleoperation systems require skilled operators and expensive interfaces to solve tasks because they assume that the operator controls a robot completely. For these problems, we propose a teleoperation system which consists of an operation system and an autonomous robot. The operation system has a man-machine interface and allows a user to specify the working space and the tasks to be done. The autonomous robot follows the instruction from the operation system to solve the specific tasks. The paper focuses on navigation problems of the autonomous robot as an essential part of the proposed system. Namely, the autonomous robot should keep on the instructed paths in the real world to achieve a goal of the tasks. Our approach is based on a sensor fusion method based on two learning schemes: self-organizing map (SOM) and reinforcement learning. These learning schemes allow the system to be able to solve the tasks in an unreliable environment such as outdoors.

Addressing the path-explosion problem has been a significant challenge in concolic testing. Diverse search heuristics have been proposed to mitigate this problem but using search heuristics alone is not sufficient to substantially improve code coverage for real-world programs. The goal of this paper is to complement existing techniques and achieve higher coverage by exploiting templates in concolic testing. In our approach, a template is a partially symbolized input vector whose job is to reduce the search space. However, choosing a right set of templates is nontrivial and significantly affects the final performance of our approach. We present an algorithm that automatically learns useful templates online, based on data collected from previous runs of concolic testing.

10.1109/THS.2013.6699006,The CERT assessment tool: Increasing a security incident responder's ability to assess risk,IEEE,Conferences,"We set out to create an assessment and situational awareness tool for incident response. Extracting the risk assessment expertise and creating a systemic step-by-step workflow that could be followed by non-experts was challenging; however, what proved to be even more difficult was the mapping of that workflow to a common, natural language used by non-experts while still supporting the incident response. We at the Digital Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (DIID) have developed a way to maintain the velocity of incident response through the creation of a feed-forward decision support system to assist a security responder deal with the scale and challenges of assessing risk in critical information systems. Unfortunately, many applications fall short of expectations because the technology is used inappropriately: the wrong tool applied in the wrong way. Taking interaction techniques combined with a decision support system and applying them to one particularly demanding area - security incident response - leads to the conclusion that there is a proper and formal way to approach maintaining situational awareness in this complex domain. The CERT Assessment Tool increases a security incident responder's ability to assess risk and identify the incident response plan of critical information systems. The interface has four primary affordances to the user: (1) digital storage of the collected interview data with tagging of the information to create meta data of the objects as well as standardize terminology by reusing objects, (2) structured data that enables situational awareness of all systems on site and flexibility and recursion of system attributes, (3) guidance questions that provide runtime support for the system currently being assessed and a general direction to better assess each system based on historical data, and (4) real-time rules that make recommendations to the user through `push' notifications, which enables a user to identify and mitigate risk in information systems security affecting the safety of a system or the implementation of the security plan. The creation of a security decision support system framework to represent a series of steps to view the entire space of a security incident allows us to use techniques specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of incident response - pre-incident (perception), during the event (comprehension), or after the event (projection). This combination of rules based on machine learning and push notifications are a first step in how computers will be able to support and advance the decision support technologies that are the backbone of this system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6699006/,2013 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST),12-14 Nov. 2013,ieeexplore

10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280318,The on-line curvilinear component analysis (onCCA) for real-time data reduction,IEEE,Conferences,"Real time pattern recognition applications often deal with high dimensional data, which require a data reduction step which is only performed offline. However, this loses the possibility of adaption to a changing environment. This is also true for other applications different from pattern recognition, like data visualization for input inspection. Only linear projections, like the principal component analysis, can work in real time by using iterative algorithms while all known nonlinear techniques cannot be implemented in such a way and actually always work on the whole database at each epoch. Among these nonlinear tools, the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA), which is a non-convex technique based on the preservation of the local distances into the lower dimensional space, plays an important role. This paper presents the online version of CCA. It inherits the same features of CCA, is adaptive in real time and tracks non-stationary high dimensional distributions. It is composed of neurons with two weights: one, pointing to the input space, quantizes the data distribution, and the other, pointing to the output space, represents the projection of the first weight. This on-line CCA has been conceived not only for the previously cited applications, but also as a basic tool for more complex supervised neural networks for modelling very complex high dimensional data. This algorithm is tested on 2-D and 3-D synthetic data and on an experimental database concerning the bearing faults of an electrical motor, with the goal of novelty (fault) detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7280318/,2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),12-17 July 2015,ieeexplore

From the biological systems it appears that it is not only a matter of computational power but also the right sensors and methods of implementation. In this work we understood that the invention of the powerful and practically realizable, emerging paradigm called cellular nonlinear network (CNN) fully realized the concept of real-time handling of time signals coining from space distribution sources. On the other hand inertial gyro sensor can increase the robustness and computing efficiency of vision system, which is subject to signal degradation and high computational expense, by providing a frame-to-frame prediction of camera orientation and position. Since most of the earlier or recent studies have tackled the artificial vision with two or three views in account, in this work we present a direct trigonometric recovery of 3D scene geometry from a stream of images. These images are vertically rectified using gyroscopes' output to minimize the token relative displacements between each frame. To match this vertically rectified stream of images in real-tune we borrow the strength of CNN, and the matching results are trigonometrically processed for 3D range estimation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1292255/,"The Thrity-Seventh Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers, 2003",9-12 Nov. 2003,ieeexplore

Going over the solutions of neural networks, the systolic structure gives the biggest possibility for smart realization of a speech processor. A speech processing system, built generally as software surroundings, occupies an immense memory space. For real-time application it is necessary to combine the existing algorithms. Further increasing of the speed can be also achieved by using hardware-software co-design. The approach presented in this paper, permits to design such effective systems of human voice synthesis and speech identification. Since the spoken language can be very often ambiguous, then it was useful to include a fuzzy logic approach and also artificial neural networks, to obtain more effective methods of speech processing.

Most music players and streaming services propose a paradigm based on content listing of meta-data information, which provides little insight on the music content.

In this work we propose a framework for music browsing based on the navigation into a three-dimensional (3-D) space, where musical items are placed as a 3-D mapping of their high-level semantic descriptors. We conducted a survey to guide the design of the framework and the implementation choices. We rely on state-of-the-art techniques from Music Information Retrieval to automatically extract the high-level descriptors from a low-level representation of the musical signal.

We develop constraints for such an adaptation process and show the applicability to networked embedded systems like automotive in-vehicle networks. Then, we analyze two approaches for finding solutions in the resulting search space for adaptations, one based on planning algorithms and the other based on constraint solving. While planning approaches start from the current configuration and aim to find a migration sequence and a valid configuration, constraint solving approaches first find solutions and then check for a possible migration sequence.

This paper deals with a prominent type of automated negotiations, namely, multilateral multi-issue negotiation that runs under real-time constraints and in which the negotiating agents have no prior knowledge about their opponents' preferences over the space of negotiation outcomes. We propose a novel negotiation approach which enables an agent to reach an efficient agreement with multiple opponents. The proposed approach achieves that goal by, 1) employing sparse pseudo-input Gaussian processes to model the behavior of opponents, 2) learning fuzzy opponent preferences to increase the satisfaction of other parties, and 3) adopting an adaptive decision-making mechanism to handle uncertainty in negotiation.

These cameras either trade-off spatial resolution to capture single-shot LF or tradeoff temporal resolution by assuming a static scene to capture high spatial resolution LF. Thus, capturing high spatial resolution LF video for dynamic scenes remains an open and challenging problem. We present the concept, design and implementation of a LF video camera that allows capturing high resolution LF video. The spatial, angular and temporal resolution are not fixed a-priori and we exploit the scene-specific redundancy in space, time and angle. Our reconstruction is motion-aware and offers a continuum of resolution tradeoff with increasing motion in the scene. The key idea is (a) to design efficient multiplexing matrices that allow resolution tradeoffs, (b) use dictionary learning and sparse representations for robust reconstruction, and (c) perform local motion-aware adaptive reconstruction.

AI-assisted video analytics can provide valuable information and benefits in various domains. Face recognition, object detection, or movement tracing are prominent examples enabled by this technology. However, such mechanisms also entail threats regarding privacy and security, for example if the video contains identifiable persons. Therefore, adequate data protection is an increasing concern in video analytics. AI-assisted data protection mechanisms, such as face blurring, can help, but are often computationally expensive. Additionally, the heterogeneous hardware of end devices and the time-varying load on edge services need to be considered. Therefore, such systems need to adapt to react to changes during their operation, ensuring that conflicting requirements on data protection, performance, and accuracy are addressed in the best possible way. Sound adaptation decisions require an understanding of the adaptation options and their impact on different quality attributes. In this paper, we identify factors that can be adapted in AI-assisted data protection for video analytics using the example of a face blurring pipeline.

Nevertheless, the ability of modern applications to be deployed in numerous different ways has complicated their structure and enormously increased the difficulty of extracting accurate performance models for them. This capability is crucial for many operations, such as the identification of the most appropriate execution setups for an anticipated workload, finding bottlenecks, etc. In this work, we propose a fully automated performance modeling methodology that aims at the creation of highly accurate performance models for a given maximum number of deployments. The main idea of the proposed methodology lies on the ""smart"" exploration of the application configuration space, the selection and deployment of a set of representative application configurations and the construction of the performance model through the adoption of Machine Learning techniques. Moreover, taking into consideration the often unstable and error-prone nature of the cloud, the proposed system attempts to overcome transient cloud failures that occur during the application deployment phase through the re-execution of the parts that failed.

While this kind of data is increasingly rich and offers many grand opportunities to identify patterns and predict behaviour of groups and individuals, it is not immediately obvious how to develop a framework for extracting plausible inferences from these data. In our case, we have access to a large volume of real user data from the Point smart phone application, and we have developed a generic and layered system architecture to incrementally find aggregate items of interest within that data. This includes time and space correlations, e.g., are people searching for dinner and a movie, distributions of usage patterns and platforms, e.g., geographic distribution of Android, Apple, and BlackBerry users, and clustering to identify relatively complex search and movement patterns we call ""consumer trajectories."" Our pursuit of these kinds of patterns has helped guide our development of information extraction, machine learning, and visualization methods that provide systematic tools for investigating the geo-located data, and for the development of both conceptual tools and visualization tools in aid of finding both interesting and useful patterns in that data. Included in our system architecture is the ability to consider the difference between exploratory and explanatory hypotheses on data patterns, as well as the deployment of multiple visualization methods that can provide alternatives to help expose interesting patterns.

Deploying Mo-cap or camera systems to perform this tracking tend to be costly, intrusive, or require a clear line of sight, making them ill-adapted for artistic performances. In this paper, we explore the use of consumer-grade armbands (Myo armband) which capture orientation information (via an inertial measurement unit) and muscle activity (via electromyography) to ultimately guide a robotic device during live performances. To compensate for the drop in information quality, our approach rely heavily on machine learning and leverage the multimodality of the sensors. In order to speed-up classification, dimensionality reduction was performed automatically via a method based on Random Forests (RF). Online classification results achieved 88% accuracy over nine movements created by a dancer during a live performance, demonstrating the viability of our approach. The nine movements are then grouped into three semantically-meaningful moods by the dancer for the purpose of an artistic performance achieving 94% accuracy in real-time.

Traditional color space based traffic lights detection algorithms could be easily affected by other objects (such as buildings, car taillights) in the surrounding environment, and the detection accuracy and real-time performance are not ideal enough. Generally, the deep learning based methods have better advantages of real-time and accuracy performance for the normal scene with obvious traffic lights targets. However, the small traffic lights targets detection rate and accuracy in night-time of these methods are still can't be satisfactory. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel traffic lights detection and recognition algorithm based on multi-feature fusion, which can be implemented in two steps (detection and recognition). For the first step, the SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) super-pixel segmentation algorithm is used for purposes reducing the image data processing complexity and improving the real-time performance. The mean-shift algorithm was used to cluster the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space components respectively for enhancing the target data and reducing the interference from other targets. For the second step, the feature information extracted by CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradient) feature are fused. The SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is trained on a data set of traffic lights established by our own.

But the growth of network infrastructure leads to a tremendous increase of energy consumption. Using renewable energy harvested from the environment to power the small cell base station, forming green heterogeneous networks (HetNets), can help reduce the conventional energy consumption. However, the stochastic user demand and random renewable energy harvesting amount have brought new challenges for the network operation. Based on reinforcement learning, this paper proposes a decentralized and a centralized base station operation scheme. Assuming each base station operates individually, the energy efficiency maximization problem is modeled as a general-sum game. After defining the state, action and reward of each base station, the problem can be solved by multi-agent reinforcement learning. Assuming there is a centralized controller, then the whole network can be seen as a huge agent, thus, the problem can be solved using deep reinforcement learning since the state space is too complicated. Simulation results show the centralized scheme shows higher performance but need more signaling overheads. The energy efficiency is lower for the decentralized scheme but it can be realized easier in real life.

10.1109/IJCNN.2000.861451,Training neural networks with threshold activation functions and constrained integer weights,IEEE,Conferences,"Evolutionary neural network training algorithms are presented. These algorithms are applied to train neural networks with weight values confined to a narrow band of integers. We constrain the weights and biases in the range [-2/sup k+1/+1, 2/sup k-1/-1], for k=3, 4, 5, thus they can be represented by just k bits. Such neural networks are better suited for hardware implementation than the real weight ones. Mathematical operations that are easy to implement in software might often be very burdensome in the hardware and therefore more costly. Hardware-friendly algorithms are essential to ensure the functionality and cost effectiveness of the hardware implementation. To this end, in addition to the integer weights, the trained neural networks use threshold activation functions only, so hardware implementation is even easier. These algorithms have been designed keeping in mind that the resulting integer weights require less bits to be stored and the digital arithmetic operations between them are easier to be implemented in hardware. Obviously, if the network is trained in a constrained weight space, smaller weights are found and less memory is required. On the other hand, as we have found here, the network training procedure can be more effective and efficient when larger weights are allowed. Thus, for a given application a trade off between effectiveness and memory consumption has to be considered. Our intention is to present results of evolutionary algorithms on this difficult task.

To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new method called Trajectory-based Split Hindsight Reverse Curriculum Learning. This method of reverse learning from the goal can greatly improve the learning efficiency and the final performance of the tasks. Specifically, based on referred trajectories, the agent starts to learn in a small state space near the goal and then gradually in larger state spaces until covering the entire state space. Through split hindsight experience replay, the sampled trajectory is divided into segments that match the current subspace's size; then, they are modified to successful trajectories to enable more efficient learning. In both simulation and real-world experiments, our method surpasses the existing methods and achieves the goal-oriented grasping tasks with higher success rates and better data efficiencies.

Prototypical Network is a promising approach to address the key issue of over-fitting for few-shot learning. Nevertheless, the original Prototypical Network only uses one or few labeled instances to represent the corresponding class, which easily deviates from the real class distribution leading to the imprecise classification results. In this paper, we propose Transductive Prototypical Network (Td-PN), a universal transductive approach that refines the class representations by merging scarce labeled samples and high-confidence ones of target set. Our proposed Td-PN first maps the samples to a classifying-friendly (discriminative) embedding space by redesigning a weighted contrastive loss, then utilizes the transductive inference to obtain the powerful prototype representation for each class.

10.1109/SEAMS.2017.11,Transfer Learning for Improving Model Predictions in Highly Configurable Software,IEEE,Conferences,"Modern software systems are built to be used in dynamic environments using configuration capabilities to adapt to changes and external uncertainties. In a self-adaptation context, we are often interested in reasoning about the performance of the systems under different configurations. Usually, we learn a black-box model based on real measurements to predict the performance of the system given a specific configuration. However, as modern systems become more complex, there are many configuration parameters that may interact and we end up learning an exponentially large configuration space. Naturally, this does not scale when relying on real measurements in the actual changing environment. We propose a different solution: Instead of taking the measurements from the real system, we learn the model using samples from other sources, such as simulators that approximate performance of the real system at low cost. We define a cost model that transform the traditional view of model learning into a multi-objective problem that not only takes into account model accuracy but also measurements effort as well. We evaluate our cost-aware transfer learning solution using real-world configurable software including (i) a robotic system, (ii) 3 different stream processing applications, and (iii) a NoSQL database system.

10.1109/ICDM.2010.146,Transfer Learning via Cluster Correspondence Inference,IEEE,Conferences,"Transfer learning targets to leverage knowledge from one domain for tasks in a new domain. It finds abundant applications, such as text/sentiment classification. Many previous works are based on cluster analysis, which assume some common clusters shared by both domains. They mainly focus on the one-to-one cluster correspondence to bridge different domains. However, such a correspondence scheme might be too strong for real applications where each cluster in one domain corresponds to many clusters in the other domain. In this paper, we propose a Cluster Correspondence Inference (CCI) method to iteratively infer many-to-many correspondence among clusters from different domains. Specifically, word clusters and document clusters are exploited for each domain using nonnegative matrix factorization, then the word clusters from different domains are corresponded in a many-to-many scheme, with the help of shared word space as a bridge. These two steps are run iteratively and label information is transferred from source domain to target domain through the inferred cluster correspondence.

In this paper, we analyze the possibility of performing a knowledge transfer, in which a machine learning model trained on a particular network configuration is used to predict a quantity of interest in a new, unknown setting. We focus on the tilt-dependent received signal strength maps as quantities of interest and we analyze two cases where the knowledge acquired for a particular antenna tilt setting is transferred to (i) a different tilt configuration of the same antenna or (ii) a different antenna with the same tilt configuration.

The proposed techniques for tackling such large networks employ the following two approaches for retaining the sparseness of their underlying graphs and reasoning with them: (i) graph triangulation and sparse matrix implementation, and (ii) graph partitioning and parallelization. Regarding the latter approach, an implementation has been offered recently, presented in [AAAI, 2014]. However, although the implementation looks promising and with space for improvement, an improper use of competing solvers in the evaluation process resulted in the wrong conclusion that it is able to provide fast consistency for very large qualitative spatial networks with respect to the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we review the two aforementioned approaches and provide new results that are different to the results presented in [AAAI, 2014] by properly re-evaluating them with the benchmark dataset of that paper.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classic technique for extracting the linear structure of a dataset, which is useful for feature extraction and data compression. In this work, we propose the deployment of distributed PCA over a multi-access channel based on the algorithm of stochastic gradient descent to learn the dominant feature space of a distributed dataset at multiple devices. Over- the-air aggregation is adopted to reduce the multi-access latency, giving the name over-the-air PCA. The novelty of this design lies in exploiting channel noise to accelerate the descent in the region around each saddle point encountered by gradient descent, thereby increasing the convergence speed of over-the-air PCA. The idea is materialized by proposing a power-control scheme controlling the level of channel noise accordingly. The scheme is proved to achieve faster convergence than in the case without power control by experiments on real datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9593170/,2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC),27-30 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

However, compared to Type-I OBL, which cannot address a real sense of opposition in term of objective value, the Type-II OBL is capable to discover more meaningful knowledge about problem's landscape.

10.1109/AERO.2017.7943775,UAV tracking and following a ground target under motion and localisation uncertainty,IEEE,Conferences,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in numerous applications, such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, ecology and search and rescue missions. Effective use of UAVs depends on the ability of the system to navigate in the mission scenario, especially if the UAV is required to navigate autonomously. There are particular scenarios in which UAV navigation faces challenges and risks. This creates the need for robust motion planning capable of overcoming different sources of uncertainty. One example is a UAV flying to search, track and follow a mobile ground target in GPS-denied space, such as below canopy or in between buildings, while avoiding obstacles. A UAV navigating under these conditions can be affected by uncertainties in its localization and motion due to occlusion of GPS signals and the use of low cost sensors. Additionally, the presence of strong winds in the airspace can disturb the motion of the UAV. In this paper, we describe and flight test a novel formulation of a UAV mission for searching, tracking and following a mobile ground target. This mission is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and implemented in real flight using a modular framework. We modelled the UAV dynamic system, the uncertainties in motion and localization of both the UAV and the target, and the wind disturbances. The framework computes a motion plan online for executing motion commands instead of flying to way-points to accomplish the mission. The system enables the UAV to plan its motion allowing it to execute information gathering actions to reduce uncertainty by detecting landmarks in the scenario, while making predictions of the mobile target trajectory and the wind speed based on observations. Results indicate that the system overcomes uncertainties in localization of both the aircraft and the target, and avoids collisions into obstacles despite the presence of wind.

To solve above research challenges, this paper models a U-WSC problem into a U-WSC planning problem. Accordingly, two novel uncertain planning algorithms using heuristic search called UCLAO* and BHUC, are presented to solve the U-WSC planning problem with state space reduction, which leads to high efficiency of finding a service composition solution.

10.1109/COMSWA.2007.382562,Ubiquitous Semantic Space: A context-aware and coordination middleware for Ubiquitous Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"Ubiquitous computing poses the challenge of increased communication, context-awareness and functionality. In a highly dynamic and weekly connected ubiquitous environment, continuous access to the network (synchronous communication) is very difficult. So it's necessary to go for tuple space which provides asynchronous communication without any loss in data. Tuple space offers a coordination infrastructure for communication between autonomous entities by providing a logically shared memory along with data persistence, transactional security as well as temporal and spatial decoupling properties that make it desirable for distributed systems [2] such as ubiquitous computing. In order to automate the task and the system to be intelligent, context awareness is a must. This can be achieved by using semantic web technology. Existing middleware's for ubiquitous computing concentrates on RPC communication paradigm and deals with context-awareness separately. In our approach of constructing the middleware we provide common solution to both communication and context-awareness using ubiquitous semantic space. Ubiquitous semantic space [5] brings together tuple space, semantic web technologies and ubiquitous computing. Hence in this paper, we introduce a context-aware and co-ordination middleware framework for ubiquitous environment using ubiquitous semantic space. Ubiquitous semantic space uses ontologies to define the semantics of various concepts. Using ontologies facilitates different agents in the environments to have a common semantic understanding of different contexts. Ontology is represented using ontology web language, OWL [6]. We have modeled a ubiquitous semantic space ontology structure suitable for communicating conceptual information among the agents. Our model also incorporates context-triggered action which is more useful for real-time ubiquitous application having reactive behavior. For enabling context-triggered action, our model has reactive space into ubiquitous semantic space. Reactive space, stores rules written in SWRL [22], semantic web rule language and fired using JESS [3] reasoner at the appropriate time. The middleware could easily adapt to changes in the environment. The structure of the ubiquitous semantic space is designed in a fashion to have privacy among the communicating devices and the agents. Hence our middleware uses a decentralized architecture which supports asynchronous communication, context-awareness, context-sensitive communication, Privacy sensitive, adaptive to context-changes and reactive to emergency situation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4267986/,2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware,7-12 Jan. 2007,ieeexplore

A few modern ML frameworks are focusing on the generation of small-size ML models (often in kBs) that can directly be flashed and executed on tiny IoT devices, particularly the embedded systems. Edge analytics eliminates expensive device-to-cloud communications, thereby producing intelligent devices that can perform energy-efficient real-time offline analytics. Any increase in the training data results in a linear increase in the size and space complexity of the trained ML models, making them unable to be deployed on IoT devices with limited memory. To alleviate the memory issue, a few studies have focused on optimizing and fine-tuning existing ML algorithms to reduce their complexity and size. However, such optimization is usually dependent on the nature of IoT data being trained. In this paper, we presented an approach that protects model quality without requiring any alteration to the existing ML algorithms. We propose SRAM-optimized implementation and efficient deployment of widely used standard/stable ML-frameworks classifier versions (e.g., from Python scikit-learn).

But still, it is quite challenging to deploy the baseline model into memory constrained micro-controller units. Design Space Exploration of the above-mentioned model can make it less memory and computationally intensive. This paper proposes some modifications to the existing baseline MobileNet architecture to make it more efficient and suitable to be deployed on real-time embedded platforms. The intent behind developing such an architecture is to reduce the size, the number of parameters, computation time per epoch and the overfitting problem considerably without letting the accuracy drop below the baseline accuracy level. We achieve good accuracy levels by using the Swish activation function instead of the standard activation function ReLU and introducing a regularization method called random erasing instead of Drop out into the network. We decrease the model size by using Separable Convolutions in place of Depthwise Separable Convolutions, changing the channel depth, choosing an optimum width multiplier value and eliminating some layers with the same output shape, without much drop in the accuracy levels. We train the model with the above-mentioned modifications from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset and obtain a much lighter architecture as compared to the baseline MobileNet V1.

In a new environment, the pre-trained activity recognition models face challenges in presence of sensing bias- ness, device heterogeneities, and inherent variabilities in human behaviors and activities. Activity Recognition (AR) system built in one environment does not scale well in another environment, if it has to learn new activities and the annotated activity samples are scarce. Indeed building a new activity recognition model and training the model with large annotated samples often help overcome this challenging problem. However, collecting annotated samples is cost-sensitive and learning activity model at wild is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose an activity recognition framework, UnTran that utilizes source domains' pre-trained autoencoder enabled activity model that transfers two layers of this network to generate a common feature space for both source and target domain activities. We postulate a hybrid AR framework that helps fuse the decisions from a trained model in source domain and two activity models (raw and deep-feature based activity model) in target domain reducing the demand of annotated activity samples to help recognize unseen activities. We evaluated our framework with three real-world data traces consisting of 41 users and 26 activities in total. Our proposed UnTran AR framework achieves ≈ 75% F1 score in recognizing unseen new activities using only 10% labeled activity data in the target domain.

DRL agents are mostly trained with transition pairs and interaction trajectories generated from simulation, and they can achieve satisfying or near optimal performances under familiar input states. However, for relative rare visited or even unvisited regions in the state space, there is no guarantee that the agent could perform well. Unfortunately, novel conditions are inevitable in real-world problems and there is always a gap between the real data and simulated data. Therefore, to implement DRL algorithms in real-world transportation systems, we should not only train the agent learn a policy that maps states to actions, but also the model uncertainty associated with each action. In this study, we adapt the method of Bayesian ensemble to train a group of agents with imposed diversity for an energy management system of a delivery vehicle. The agents in the ensemble agree well on familiar states but show diverse results on unfamiliar or novel states.

To study the problem, we propose a dataset containing 75244 synthetic and 2190 real images with annotations for 16 different artworks. We hence investigate different domain adaptation techniques based on image-to-image translation and feature alignment. Our analysis points out that such techniques can be useful to address the domain adaptation issue, while there is still plenty of space for improvement on the proposed dataset.

In this paper, a method based on geodesic flow kernel (GFK) for feature transfer is proposed. By mapping data into the manifold space, the feature transfer from source domain to target domain is implemented. Distribution adaptation of real-time data and modeling data is performed to reduce the distribution difference between them. The historical data through distribution adaptation is used to establish a regression model to predict the real-time data, by which the unsupervised batch process soft sensor modeling is realized.

Existing methods mainly use supervised learning to track down root causes and only a few of these provide enough information to identify the function in which a software bug occurs. Supervised learning methods work well when scenarios can be repeated, and the normal behavior is somewhat similar. In RAN, where thousands of different configurations are used, software is updated frequently, and each node has its own traffic intensity, using unsupervised learning that does not require any pre-training can be more suitable. The few existing methods that use unsupervised learning to locate the root cause of software bugs can only detect delays or software hangs, and are not able to identify the many types of bugs that occur in RAN. We propose a multi-step method that uses unsupervised learning to analyze kernel and user space traces in system logs. The methods can guide developers by suggesting top-k candidate functions that are likely to contain a software bug. Our methods, MultiSpace and CallGraph were evaluated using an advanced 5G testbed in which many different software bugs that are common in RAN, were injected. The results shows that MultiSpace and CallGraph, can detect a wider range of software bugs than previous methods and only adds an average CPU load of 1.3% on the testbed. An important aspect is also that our methods scale well with large amount of data produced by real time systems, like RAN, and can analyze the data much faster.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9700501/,2022 IEEE 19th Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC),8-11 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore

Consequently, the approach is arbitrarily scalable, adapts to exogenous disturbances, and is robust to failures of individual agents. This algorithm is an example of a decentralized primal-space algorithm for constrained non-linear optimization that achieves coordination between agents using stigmergic memory cues present in the physical system as opposed to explicit communication and synchronization. Not only does this work make of stigmergy, a property first used to describe decentralized decision making in eusocial insects, but details of the algorithm are inspired by classic social foraging theory and more recent results in eusocial-insect macronutrient regulation. This theoretical analysis in this paper guarantees that the decentralized stigmergically coupled system converges to within a finite neighborhood of the optimal resource allocation. These results are validated using a hardware implementation of the algorithm in a small-scale intelligent lighting scenario. There are other real-time distributed resource allocation applications that are amenable to these methods, like distributed power generation, in general, this paper means to provide proof of concept that physical variables in cyberphysical systems can be leveraged to reduce the communication burden of algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6969416/,2014 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops,19-23 May 2014,ieeexplore

However, their broad use is limited by the required manual configurations for input value selection, GUI state comparison and clickable detection. In existing crawlers, the configurations are usually string-matching based rules looking for tags or attributes of DOM elements, and often application-specific. Moreover, in input topic identification, it can be difficult to determine which rule suggests a better match when several rules match an input field to more than one topic. This paper presents a natural-language approach based on semantic similarity to address the above issues. The proposed approach represents DOM elements as vectors in a vector space formed by the words used in the elements. The topics of encountered input fields during crawling can then be inferred by their similarities with ones in a labeled corpus. Semantic similarity can also be applied to suggest if a GUI state is newly discovered and a DOM element is clickable under an unsupervised learning paradigm. We evaluated the proposed approach in input topic identification with 100 real-world forms and GUI state comparison with real data from industry. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach has comparable or better performance to the conventional techniques.

Using low-cost edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi (RPI), it is possible to not only read power and irradiance values from in-situ sensors, but to also apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms for real-time analysis and for detecting anomalous behaviors. This paper presents the design and implementation of an edge analytics application that uses RPI as an edge device. The Isolation Forest algorithm was first used to detect shading anomalies. A Siamese neural network was then trained to create a latent-space mapping. An anomaly detection model based on the latent space and a neural network and kNN was developed. These models could detect shading anomalies with an F1-Score of 0.94. Embedded variants of the model based on TensorFlow Lite and TensorRT were evaluated to service a large number of solar panels at 1Hz.

10.1109/AERO.2015.7119180,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to achieve a robust architecture for future robotic spacecraft,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator.

10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172453,Utilizing Reinforcement Learning to Autonomously Mange Buffers in a Delay Tolerant Network Node,IEEE,Conferences,"In order to effectively communicate with Earth from deep space there is a need for network automation similar to that of the Internet. The existing automated network protocols, such as TCP and IP, cannot work in deep space due to the assumptions under which they were designed. Specifically, protocols assume the existence of an end-to-end path between the source and destination for the entirety of a communication session and the path being traversable in a negligible amount of time. In contrast, a Delay Tolerant Network is a set of protocols that allows networking in environments where links suffer from high-delay or disruptions (e.g. Deep Space). These protocols rely on different assumptions such as time synchronization and suitable memory allocation. In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomously avoiding memory overflows in a Delay Tolerant Node. To that end, we propose using Reinforcement Learning to automate buffer management given that we can easily measure the relative rates of data coming in and out of the DTN node. In the case of detecting overflow, we let the autonomous agent choose between three actions: slowing down the client, requesting more resources from the Deep Space Network, or selectively dropping packets once the buffer nears capacity. Furthermore, we show that all of these actions can be realistically implemented in real-life operations given current and planned capabilities of Delay Tolerant Networking and the Deep Space Network. Similarly, we also show that using Reinforcement Learning for this problem is well suited to this application due to the number of possible states and variables, as well as the fact that large distances between deep space spacecraft and Earth prevent human-in-the-loop intervention.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172453/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore

A major share of such images originate from smart phone cameras capable of very high resolution captures. Most of the existing methods either focus on restoration quality by compromising on processing speed and memory requirements or, focus on removing reflections at very low resolutions, there by limiting their practical deploy-ability. We propose a light weight deep learning model for reflection removal using a novel scale space architecture. Our method processes the corrupted image in two stages, a Low Scale Sub-network (LSSNet) to process the lowest scale and a Progressive Inference (PI) stage to process all the higher scales. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the sub-networks in PI stage are designed to be much shallower than LSSNet. Moreover, we employ weight sharing between various scales within the PI stage to limit the model size. This also allows our method to generalize to very high resolutions without explicit retraining. Our method is superior both qualitatively and quantitatively compared to the state of the art methods and at the same time 20× faster with 50× less number of parameters compared to the most recent state-of-the-art algorithm RAGNet.

In robotics especially, training and deployment conditions often vary and data collection is expensive, making retraining undesirable. Simulation training allows for feasible training times, but on the other hand suffer from a reality-gap when applied in real-world settings. This raises the need of efficient adaptation of policies acting in new environments.We consider the problem of transferring knowledge within a family of similar Markov decision processes. We assume that Q-functions are generated by some low-dimensional latent variable. Given such a Q-function, we can find a master policy that can adapt given different values of this latent variable. Our method learns both the generative mapping and an approximate posterior of the latent variables, enabling identification of policies for new tasks by searching only in the latent space, rather than the space of all policies. The low-dimensional space, and master policy found by our method enables policies to quickly adapt to new environments.

Major concerns with existing defense mechanisms include non-generalizability across different attacks, models and large inference time. In this paper, we propose a generalized defense mechanism capitalizing on the expressive power of regularized latent space based generative models. We design an adversarial filter, devoid of access to classifier and adversaries, which makes it usable in tandem with any classifier. The basic idea is to learn a Lipschitz constrained mapping from the data manifold, incorporating adversarial perturbations, to a quantized latent space and re-map it to the true data manifold. Specifically, we simultaneously auto-encode the data manifold and its perturbations implicitly through the perturbations of the regularized and quantized generative latent space, realized using variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation in providing resilience against multiple attack types (black and white box) and methods, while being almost real-time.

Closed set classifiers wrongly attempt to classify instances from an unknown class as belonging to one of the known classes from the training set, which reduces the model’s accuracy. Ideally, these unknown instances should be recognized as such, while known instances should continue to be accurately classified. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art open set methods solve this problem by making restrictive assumptions on the variance and/or boundedness of the distributions of known classes. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Variational Open-Set Recognition (VOSR) that eliminates these assumptions. VOSR incorporates a closed set classifier, an unknown detector, and a novel Structured Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (SGM-VAE) that guarantees separable class distributions with known variances in its la-tent space. Further, by encouraging a large distance between class-specific distributions, VOSR increases the likelihood that instances from unknown classes lie in low-probability regions and thus are more readily identifiable. In rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that VOSR outperforms state-of-the-art open set classifiers with up to a 14% F1 score increase in identifying instances from unknown classes in multiple image classification and human activity recognition datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9671727/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),15-18 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

To cope with this, an action set is constructed in such a way that one action consists of a series of the same action primitive which is successively executed until the current state changes. Next, to speed up the learning time, a mechanism of learning form easy missions (or LEM) which is a similar technique to ""shaping"" in animal learning is implemented.

It can use two coaxial wheels to achieve the body self-balancing, forward moving and turning. But the general wheeled inverted pendulum robot seldom has vision function to perceive enviromental change. In order to realize the robust visual control, a wheeled inverted-pendulum vision robot with attitude sensors, photoelectric encoders, ultrasonic sensors and so on is designed based on Beaglebone Black board. The moving object is separated in the space domain by obtaining the image sequence which is sent by a robot-mounted camera, and the modeling, identification and tracking of target sequence are implemented in the time domain. The balance PD, speed PI and steering PD controllers are designed to realize the dynamic balance, forward and steering function of the robot. To satisfy the functional requirements of the visual tracking system, an improved tracking-learning-detection algorithm based on kernelized correlation filtering is used, and a tracking anomaly based on spatial context is detected to determine the tracking state and reduce the error rate.

Currently, most VCSes exploit automatic speaker verification (ASV) to prevent various voice attacks (e.g., replay attack). In this study, we present VMask, a novel and practical voiceprint mimicry attack that could fool ASV in smart home and inject the malicious voice command disguised as a legitimate user. The key observation behind VMask is that the deep learning models utilized by ASV are vulnerable to the subtle perturbations in the voice input space. To generate these subtle perturbations, VMask leverages the idea of adversarial examples. Then by adding the subtle perturbations to the recordings from an arbitrary speaker, VMask can mislead the ASV into classifying the crafted speech samples, which mirror the former speaker for human, as the targeted victim. Moreover, psychoacoustic masking is employed to manipulate the adversarial perturbations under human perception threshold, thus making victim unaware of ongoing attacks. We validate the effectiveness of VMask by performing comprehensive experiments on both grey box (VGGVox) and black box (Microsoft Azure Speaker Verification) ASVs. Additionally, a real-world case study on Apple HomeKit proves the VMask's practicability on smart home platforms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9155483/,IEEE INFOCOM 2020 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,6-9 July 2020,ieeexplore

A wireless sensor network-based approach to detect car positions,IEEE,Conferences,"The global trend of increased urbanization makes space rare in city environments in general and for parking in particular. In addition, cars become bigger and often use more than one parking space. As a result neighboring parking spaces can be affected by a parked car. So, a basically free parking space might be too narrow for an arriving car depending on the arriving car's size. Therefore, means to detect car positions on parking spaces in a fine granular way are required to detect such situations and avoid inefficient parking space searches. Wireless sensor networks provide the possibility to sense the exact occupation of a parking space and potential influences on neighboring parking spaces. However, current solutions focus only on the detection if a parking space is occupied or not.

In this paper, we present WiParkFind: a low-cost, non-intrusive, and real- time parking occupancy monitoring system based on WiFi signals. The channel state information (CSI) of received WiFi signals is analyzed by using a machine learning technique to capture distinctive characteristics of CSI data that are strongly correlated with the number of empty parking slots in order to detect whether there is an empty slot, and how many empty slots are available. Compared with contemporary approaches based on magnetic sensors deployed on individual parking slots, WiParkFind utilizes low-cost off- the-shelf WiFi devices, dramatically reducing the cost for purchasing, installing, and maintaining a large number of sensors, and backend server systems.

Even until recently, automated game testing still remains to be largely untouched niche. A key challenge is that game testing often requires to play the game as a sequential decision process. A bug may only be triggered until completing certain difficult intermediate tasks, which requires a certain level of intelligence. The recent success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) sheds light on advancing automated game testing, without human competitive intelligent support. However, the existing DRLs mostly focus on winning the game rather than game testing. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of 1349 real bugs from four real-world commercial game products. Based on this, we propose four oracles to support automated game testing, and further propose Wuji, an on-the-fly game testing framework, which leverages evolutionary algorithms, DRL and multi-objective optimization to perform automatic game testing. Wuji balances between winning the game and exploring the space of the game. Winning the game allows the agent to make progress in the game, while space exploration increases the possibility of discovering bugs. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on a simple game and two popular commercial games. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Wuji in exploring space and detecting bugs.

However, MR records are of noisy and partial observations regarding to mobile objects' geo-locations and hence pose challenges to accurate telco data localization. There have been quite a few attempts. Single-point localization methods map a MR record to a location, but come out with limited accuracies due to the ignorance of spatiotemporal coherence of successive MR records. Recent efforts on sequential localization techniques alleviate this by mapping a sequence of MR records to a trajectory. However, existing solutions are often with assumptions on specific models, e.g., mobility and signal strength distributions, or priori knowledge on topology space, e.g., road networks, limiting the deployment in practice. To this end, we propose a data-driven framework to tackle the challenges in sequential telco localization. We solely use raw MR records and a public third-party GPS dataset for the learning of the correlations between mobile objects' locations and MR records, requiring no model assumptions and priori knowledge. To handle the data-intensive workloads during the learning process, we use materialized views for efficient online localization and light-weighted indexing techniques for periodical parameters tuning, in order to improve the efficiency and scalability. Results on real data show that our solution achieves 58.8 percent improvement in median localization errors compared with state-of-art sequential localization techniques that require hypothesis models and priori knowledge, making our solution superior in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and employability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939387/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

The model explains how motion ambiguities caused by the motion aperture problem can be solved for coherently moving objects of arbitrary size by means of cortical mechanisms. The major bottleneck in the development of a reliable biologically inspired technical system with real-time motion analysis capabilities based on this neural model is the amount of memory necessary for the representation of neural activation in velocity space. We propose a sparse coding framework for neural motion activity patterns and suggest a means by which initial activities are detected efficiently. We realize neural mechanisms such as shunting inhibition and feedback modulation in the sparse framework to implement an efficient algorithmic version of our neural model of cortical motion segregation. We demonstrate that the algorithm behaves similarly to the original neural model and is able to extract image motion from real world image sequences.

In order to improve the voluntary effort of participants during the rehabilitation training, assist-as-needed (AAN) control strategies regulating the robotic assistance according to subjects' performance and conditions have been developed. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of patients' motor function capability in task space is not taken into account during the implementation of these controllers. In this paper, a new scheme called greedy AAN (GAAN) controller is designed for the upper limb rehabilitation training of neurologically impaired subjects. The proposed GAAN control paradigm includes a baseline controller and a Gaussian RBF network that is utilized to model the functional capability of subjects and to provide corresponding a task challenge for them. In order to avoid subjects' slacking and encourage their active engagement, the weight vectors of RBF networks evaluating subjects' impairment level are updated based on a greedy strategy that makes the networks progressively learn the maximum forces over time provided by subjects. Simultaneously, a challenge level modification algorithm is employed to adjust the task challenge according to the task performance of subjects. Experiments on 12 subjects with neurological impairment are conducted to validate the performance and feasibility of the GAAN controller.

This paper reports a dual-feature-based object recognition coprocessor that exploits both histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and Haar-like descriptors with a cell-based parallel sliding-window recognition mechanism. The feature extraction circuitry for HOG and Haar-like descriptors is implemented by a pixel-based pipelined architecture, which synchronizes to the pixel frequency from the image sensor. After extracting each cell feature vector, a cell-based sliding window scheme enables parallelized recognition for all windows, which contain this cell. The nearest neighbor search classifier is, respectively, applied to the HOG and Haar-like feature space. The complementary aspects of the two feature domains enable a hardware-friendly implementation of the binary classification for pedestrian detection with improved accuracy.

10.1109/TCYB.2019.2928174,A Knee-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Compressing Deep Neural Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been regarded as fundamental tools for many disciplines. Meanwhile, they are known for their large-scale parameters, high redundancy in weights, and extensive computing resource consumptions, which pose a tremendous challenge to the deployment in real-time applications or on resource-constrained devices. To cope with this issue, compressing DNNs for accelerating its inference has drawn extensive interest recently. The basic idea is to prune parameters with little performance degradation. However, the overparameterized nature and the conflict between parameters reduction and performance maintenance make it prohibitive to manually search the pruning parameter space. In this paper, we formally establish filter pruning as a multiobjective optimization problem, and propose a knee-guided evolutionary algorithm (KGEA) that can automatically search for the solution with quality tradeoff between the scale of parameters and performance, in which both conflicting objectives can be optimized simultaneously. In particular, by incorporating a minimum Manhattan distance approach, the search effort in the proposed KGEA is explicitly guided toward the knee area, which greatly facilitates the manual search for a good tradeoff solution. Moreover, the parameter importance is directly estimated on the criterion of performance loss, which can robustly identify the redundancy. In addition to the knee solution, a performance-improved model can also be found in a fine-tuning-free fashion.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087630,A Machine Learning Method to Synthesize Channel State Information Data in Millimeter Wave Networks,IEEE,Journals,"In millimeter-wave (MMW) networks, the channel state information (CSI) carries essential information from the user to the base station (BS). The CSI values depend highly on the geometrical and physical features of the environment. Therefore, it is impossible to generate CSI data for computer simulations or analysis through mathematical models. The CSI in MMW networks can only be acquired through physical measurement(s) or with the help of expensive and complicated ray-tracing software. For many users, both these options are infeasible. This work aims to propose a simple and fast method that can generate artificial samples from the real data samples while ensuring that the artificial samples look similar to the real ones. The proposed method helps increase the size of existing CSI datasets and likely to benefit the evolution of deep learning models that need a large amount of training/testing data. The proposed method comprises two parts. (i) The first part applies data clustering and transformations such as principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction and probability integral transform (PIT) to convert the real data into a multivariate normal distribution of a smaller number of variables, and (ii) The second part synthesizes artificial data by learning from the multivariate normal distribution of the first part. The last step in the second part is to apply PIT and inverse PCA transformations to transform the artificial data into the same space as the input data. We compared the proposed method's performance with the well-known Kernel density estimation (KDE)-based methods that use Scott's rule and Silverman's rule to choose the bandwidth parameter value.

This paper proposes a Nash-Q learning based motion decision algorithm to consider the interaction.

Then, the future action space is built based the predicted local trajectory that consists of five basis actions. With that, the Nash-Q learning process can be implemented by the game between these basis actions. By elimination of strictly dominated actions and the Lemke-Howson method, the autonomous vehicle can decide the optimal action and infer the behavior of surrounding vehicle. Finally, the lane merging scenario is built to test the performance contrast to the existing methods. The driver in loop experiment is further designed to verify the interaction performance in multi-vehicle traffic.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905875,A Novel Definition of Equivalent Uniform Dose Based on Volume Dose Curve,IEEE,Journals,"With the improvement of mobile device performance, the requirement of equivalent dose description in intensity-modulated radiation therapy is increasing in mobile multimedia for healthcare. The emergence of mobile cloud computing will provide cloud servers and storage for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mobile applications, thus realizing visualized radiotherapy in a real sense. Equivalent uniform dose (EUD) is a biomedical indicator based on the dose measure. In this paper, the dose volume histogram is used to describe the dose distribution of different tissues in target and nontarget regions. The traditional definition of EUD, such as the exponential form and the linear form, has only a few parameters in the model for fast calculation. However, there is no close relationship between this traditional definition and the dose volume histogram. In order to establish the consistency between the EUD and the dose volume histogram, this paper proposes a novel definition of EUD based on the volume dose curve, called VD-EUD. By using a unique organic volume weight curve, it is easy to calculate VD-EUD for different dose distributions. In definition, different weight curves are used to represent the biological effects of different organs. For the target area, we should be more careful about those voxels with a low dose (cold point); thus, the weight curve is monotonically decreasing. While for the nontarget area, the curve is monotonically increasing. Furthermore, we present the curves for parallel, serial, and mixed organs of nontarget areas separately, and we define the weight curve form with only two parameters. Medical doctors can adjust the curve interactively according to different patients and organs. We also propose a fluence map optimization model with the VD-EUD constraint, which means that the proposed EUD constraint will lead to a large feasible solution space. We compare the generalized EUD (gEUD) and the proposed VD-EUD by experiments, which show that the VD-EUD has a closer relationship with the dose volume histogram. If the biological survival probability is equivalent to the VD-EUD, the feasible solution space would be large, and the target areas can be covered. By establishing a personalized organic weight curve, medical doctors can have a unique VD-EUD for each patient. By using the flexible and adjustable EUD definition, we can establish the VD-EUD-based fluence map optimization model, which will lead to a larger solution space than the traditional dose volume constraint-based model. The VD-EUD is a new definition; thus, we need more clinical testing and verification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673563/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Recently, text Captchas with large character sets are being increasingly popular. From the perspective of attackers, larger character set means greater solution space and better theoretical security. However, the security of Captchas with large character sets in real world has never been studied comprehensively. In this article, we introduce a simple, fast, and effective deep learning method to attack these newly emerging Captchas. Taking 11 Chinese Captchas as representatives, we ran our experimental attack on each of them. Our attack achieved high success rates, ranging from 34.7 to 86.9 percent at an average speed of 0.175 seconds on these schemes. All of the results show that the Chinese text Captcha can be easily broken, demonstrating that text Captchas with large character sets are also insecure in existing forms. As a substitute, we proposed a 3D image-based scheme combining semantic comprehension and dragging action. The preliminary experimental results show that it is more robust than current text-based schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8979440/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1 Nov.-Dec. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2171946,A Self-Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer for Global Optimization Problems,IEEE,Journals,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been shown as an effective tool for solving global optimization problems. So far, most PSO algorithms use a single learning pattern for all particles, which means that all particles in a swarm use the same strategy. This monotonic learning pattern may cause the lack of intelligence for a particular particle, which makes it unable to deal with different complex situations. This paper presents a novel algorithm, called self-learning particle swarm optimizer (SLPSO), for global optimization problems. In SLPSO, each particle has a set of four strategies to cope with different situations in the search space. The cooperation of the four strategies is implemented by an adaptive learning framework at the individual level, which can enable a particle to choose the optimal strategy according to its own local fitness landscape. The experimental study on a set of 45 test functions and two real-world problems show that SLPSO has a superior performance in comparison with several other peer algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6069879/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)",June 2012,ieeexplore

Code clones can cause trouble in software maintenance and debugging process because identifying all copied compromised code fragments in other locations is time-consuming. Researchers have been working on code clone detection issues for a long time, and the discussion mainly focuses on software engineering management and system maintenance. Another considerable issue is that code cloning provides an easy way to attackers for malicious code injection. A thorough survey work of code clone identification/detection from the security perspective is indispensable for providing a comprehensive review of existing related works and proposing future potential research directions. This paper can satisfy above requirements. We review and introduce existing security-related works following three different classifications and various comparison criteria. We then discuss three further research directions, (i) deep learning-based code clone vulnerability detection, (ii) vulnerable code clone detection for 5G-Internet of Things devices, and (iii) real-time detection methods for more efficiently detecting clone attacks. These methods are more advanced and adaptive to technological development than current technologies, and still have enough research space for future studies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378511/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

The antecedent part of the TFS-SVMPC classifier is generated using an algorithm that is similar to fuzzy clustering. The dimension of the free parameter vector in the TS consequent part of the TFS-SVMPC is first reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). A linear SVM is then used to tune the subsequent parameters in the principal component space to give the system better generalization performance. The TFS-SVMPC is used as a classifier in a camera-based real-time object detection system. The object detection system consists of two stages. The first stage uses a color histogram of the global color appearance of an object as a detection feature for a TFS-SVMPC classifier. In particular, an efficient method for histogram extraction during the image scanning process is proposed for real-time implementation. The second stage uses the geometry-dependent local color appearance as a color feature for another TFS-SVMPC classifier. Comparisons with other types of classifiers and detection methods for the detection of different objects verify the performance of the proposed TFS-SVMPC-based detection method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5892887/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,Aug. 2012,ieeexplore
10.1109/TITS.2018.2873137,A Unified Spatio-Temporal Model for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction,IEEE,Journals,"This paper proposes a unified spatio-temporal model for short-term road traffic prediction. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we develop a physically intuitive approach to traffic prediction that captures the time-varying spatio-temporal correlation between traffic at different measurement points. The spatio-temporal correlation is affected by the road network topology, time-varying speed, and time-varying trip distribution. Distinctly different from previous black-box approaches to road traffic modeling and prediction, parameters of the proposed approach have physically intuitive meanings which make them readily amendable to suit changing road and traffic conditions. Second, unlike some existing techniques that capture the variation of spatio-temporal correlation by a complete re-design and calibration of the model, the proposed approach uses a unified model that incorporates the physical factors potentially affecting the variation of spatio-temporal correlation into a series of parameters. These parameters are relatively easy to control and adjust when road and traffic conditions change, thereby greatly reducing the computational complexity. Experiments using two sets of real traffic traces demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior accuracy compared with the widely used space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (STARIMA) and the back propagation neural network approaches, and is only marginally inferior to that obtained by constructing multiple STARIMA models for different times of the day, however, with a much reduced computational and implementation complexity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8525272/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

Such operations can be carried out by industrial robots in multiple ways because an industrial robot is typically functionally redundant with respect to a finishing task. In the proposed system, a human expert demonstrates a finishing operation, and the demonstrated motion is recorded in the Cartesian space. The robot’s kinematic model is augmented with a virtual mechanism, which is defined according to the applied finishing tool. This way, the kinematic model is expanded with additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to compute the optimal joint space motion of the robot without altering the essential aspects of the Cartesian space task execution as demonstrated by the human expert. Finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, occur in contact with the treated workpiece. Since information about the contact point position is needed to control the robot during the operation, we have developed a novel approach for accurate estimation of contact points using the measured forces and torques. Finally, we applied iterative learning control to refine the demonstrated operations and compensate for inaccurate calibration and different dynamics of the robot and human demonstrator. The proposed method was verified on real robots and real polishing and grinding tasks. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>—This work was motivated by the need for automation of finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, on contemporary industrial robots. Existing approaches are both too complex and too time-consuming to be applied in flexible and small-scale production, which often requires the frequent deployment of new applications. Our approach is based on programming by demonstration and enables the programming of finishing operations also for users who are not specialists in robot programming. Programming by demonstration is especially useful for teaching finishing operations because it enables the transfer of expert knowledge about finishing skills to robots without providing lengthy task descriptions or manual coding. Besides the human demonstration of the desired operation, the proposed approach also requires the availability of the kinematic model for the machine tool applied to carry out the finishing operation. We provide several practical examples of grinding and polishing tools and how to integrate them into our approach. Another feature of the proposed system is that user demonstrations of finishing operations can be transferred between different combinations of robots and machine tools.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246671/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2021,ieeexplore

First, given orbital parameters and a manoeuvre moment, the solution model of the landing footprint of a space-to-ground vehicle under finite thrust is established. Second, given arbitrary orbital parameters and an arbitrary manoeuvre moment, a fast computational model for the landing footprint of a space-to-ground vehicle based on BP neural networks is provided. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that under the premise of ensuring accuracy, the proposed method can quickly determine the landing footprint of a space-to-ground vehicle with arbitrary orbital parameters and arbitrary manoeuvre moments.

The most commonly used techniques are based on regressions or other statistical methods. An emerging tool in rainfall estimation using satellite data is artificial neural networks (NNs), NNs are mathematical models that are capable of learning complex relationships. They consist of highly interconnected, interactive data processing units. NNs are implemented in this study to estimate rainfall, and backpropagation is used as a learning scheme. The inputs for the training phase are BTs and the outputs are rainfall rates, all generated by three-dimensional (3D) simulations based on a 3D stochastic, space-time rainfall model, and a 3D radiative transfer model. Once training is complete the NNs are presented with multi-frequency and polarized (horizontal and vertical) BT data, obtained from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument onboard the F10 and F11 polar-orbiting meteorological satellites. Hence, rainrates corresponding to real BT measurements are generated. The rainfall rates are also estimated using a log-linear regression model. Comparison of the two approaches, using simulated data, shows that the NN can represent more accurately the underlying relationship between BT and rainrate than the regression model, Comparison of the rates, estimated by both methods, with radar-estimated rainrates shows that NNs outperform the regression model.

Using this idea, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is trained to approximate the space-domain multilayered media boxed Green's functions used in the integral-equation (IE) method. Once the RBFNN has been trained, the outputs of the neural network (NN) replace the exact Green's functions, during the numerical solution of the IE. The computation of the RBFNN output values is very fast in comparison with the numerical methods used to calculate the exact Green's functions. This paper describes two novel strategies for efficiently training the RBFNN. In the first strategy, the input space of the RBFNN is divided into several spatial and frequency regions. The spatial subdivision is extended for the first time to both observation and source regions. In addition, the subdivision of the observation points regions is applied in a novel manner to the whole cross section of the metallic box. The second strategy combines the above region subdivision with an adaptive selection of the neurons variances in each region.

In this paper, we propose an attention-based network embedding model that exploits the social structures for user alignment. In particular, two main components are contained in our model framework: a masked graph attention mechanism which tries to learn the alignment task driven attention weights by the supervision of pre-aligned user pairs, and an embedding algorithm tries to learn a common vector space by explicitly modeling the weighted contribution probabilities between follower-ships and followee-ships. With the learned weights and embeddings transferring between these two components, we construct a unified model for user embedding and alignment.

With the rapid growth of reusable libraries, component-based synthesis provides a promising way, such as synthesizing Java programs that are only composed of APIs. However, the efficiency of searching for proper solutions for complex tasks is still a challenge. In certain scenarios, some API methods are frequently called together. The usage of these API methods always follows some usage patterns. Incorporating the information about API usage patterns will help to accelerate the speed of program synthesis. However, state-of-the-art synthesis tools do not capture the inherent relationships between API methods. Aiming at this problem, we propose a novel approach to accelerate the speed of API-based program synthesis via API usage pattern mining.

Adversarial attack serves as an efficient surrogate to evaluate the robustness of deep saliency models before they are deployed in real world. However, most of current adversarial attacks exploit the gradients spanning the entire image space to craft adversarial examples, ignoring the fact that natural images are high-dimensional and spatially over-redundant, thus causing expensive attack cost and poor perceptibility. To circumvent these issues, this paper builds an efficient bridge between the accessible <i>partially-white-box source</i> models and the unknown <i>black-box target</i> models. The proposed method includes two steps: 1) We design a new <i>partially-white-box</i> attack, which defines the cost function in the compact hidden space to punish a fraction of feature activations corresponding to the salient regions, instead of punishing every pixel spanning the entire dense output space. This <i>partially-white-box</i> attack reduces the redundancy of the adversarial perturbation. 2) We exploit the non-redundant perturbations from some <i>source</i> models as the prior cues, and use an iterative zeroth-order optimizer to compute the <i>directional derivatives</i> along the non-redundant prior directions, in order to estimate the actual gradient of the <i>black-box target</i> model. The non-redundant priors boost the update of some “critical” pixels locating at non-zero coordinates of the prior cues, while keeping other redundant pixels locating at the zero coordinates unaffected. Our method achieves the best tradeoff between attack ability and perturbation redundancy. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to test the robustness of 18 state-of-the-art deep saliency models against 16 malicious attacks, under both of <i>white-box</i> and <i>black-box</i> settings, which contributes a new robustness benchmark to the saliency community for the first time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325048/,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2021,ieeexplore

It is an online process with offline and online phases. In the offline phase, by applying SSA and SF to the measured data stream typed big data with noise, both preprocessing data and extracting valuable information are implemented to build two offline databases signed Off_DaB and Off_testDaB. The ANFIS identifies the dynamic response of the mechanical system via Off_DaB. Based on Off_testDaB, the parameters of the ASSBDIM are then optimized.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3023739,AlphaGo Policy Network: A DCNN Accelerator on FPGA,IEEE,Journals,"The game of GO has long been regarded as the most challenging game for artificial intelligence because of its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating its board positions. In early 2016, the defeat of Lee Sedol by AlphaGo became the milestone of artificial intelligence. AlphaGo's success lies in that it efficiently combines policy and value networks with Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). And these deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are trained by the combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. However, large convolution operations are computationally-intensive and typically require a powerful computing platform, for example, a graphics processing unit (GPU). Therefore, it is challenging to apply DCCNs in resource-limited embedded systems. Field programmable gate array (FPGA) is proposed to be an appropriate solution to implement real-time DCCNs models. However, the limited bandwidth and on-chip memory storage are the bottlenecks for DCCNs acceleration. In this article, an AlphaGo Policy Network is designed, and efficient hardware architectures are proposed to accelerate the DCCN model. The accelerator can be fit into different FPGAs, providing the balancing between processing speed and hardware resources. As an example, the AlphaGo Policy Network is implemented on Xilinx design suite VCU118, and the results show that our implementation achieved a performance of 3036.32 GOPS and achieved up to 56x speedup compared to CPU and 22.4x speedup compared to GPU.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9195476/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/TKDE.2018.2833850,An Efficient Semi-Supervised Multi-label Classifier Capable of Handling Missing Labels,IEEE,Journals,"Multi-label classification has received considerable interest in recent years. Multi-label classifiers usually need to address many issues including: handling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels, compensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering correlations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve prediction performance. To tackle datasets with a large set of labels, embedding-based methods represent the label assignments in a low-dimensional space. Many state-of-the-art embedding-based methods use a linear dimensionality reduction to map the label assignments to a low-dimensional space. However, by doing so, these methods actually neglect the tail labels - labels that are infrequently assigned to instances. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based method that non-linearly embeds the label vectors using a stochastic approach, thereby predicting the tail labels more accurately. Moreover, the proposed method has excellent mechanisms for handling missing labels, dealing with large-scale datasets, as well as exploiting unlabeled data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers by a large margin, in terms of prediction performance, as well as training time.

Black Hole (BH) optimization algorithm has been underlined as a solution for data clustering problems, in which it is a population-based metaheuristic that emulates the phenomenon of the black holes in the universe. In this instance, every solution in motion within the search space represents an individual star. The original BH has shown a superior performance when applied on a benchmark dataset, but it lacks exploration capabilities in some datasets. Addressing the exploration issue, this paper introduces the levy flight into BH algorithm to result in a novel data clustering method “Levy Flight Black Hole (LBH)”, which was then presented accordingly. In LBH, the movement of each star depends mainly on the step size generated by the Levy distribution. Therefore, the star explores an area far from the current black hole when the value step size is big, and vice versa. The performance of LBH in terms of finding the best solutions, prevent getting stuck in local optimum, and the convergence rate has been evaluated based on several unimodal and multimodal numerical optimization problems.

However, the inconsistence existing in offline data and online data may degrade the control performance. To address the aforementioned issue, an online control strategy is developed so that the control parameters can be updated online based on the real-time data measured to ensure satisfactory control performance in this study. Specifically, an online control algorithm is addressed to control the pressing-down speed of the forging machine based on the framework of the reinforcement learning that has a capability of building a complete mapping from state space to action space only according to the neighbour samples. Rather than using the way of trials and errors which is too slow to be online implementation, a taboo search is addressed to speed up the learning-working process by directly searching the control on the current states, followed by the stability conditions, derived from Lyapunov stability theory. A coarse model that is limited to get the cost information of the reinforcement learning is used to make the best of mechanism information, which prevents the occurrence of the invalid states that do not conform to system characteristics. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by an ultra-low forging machine, which outperforms the conventional approaches such as PID and neural network control approaches.

This approach offers the possibilities of increased real-time response, improved reliability and flexibility, and lower processing costs. A major component in the node architecture is a database of metaknowledge about the expertise of a node's own expert systems and those of the other processing nodes. This information is gradually accumulated during problem solving.

In a harsh remote collaboration setting, data compression techniques such as autoencoder can be utilized to obtain and transmit the data in terms of latent variables in a compact form. In addition, to ensure real-time runtime performance even under unstable environments, an anytime estimation approach is desired that can reconstruct the full contents from incomplete information. In this context, we propose a method for imputation of latent variables whose elements are partially lost. To achieve the anytime property with only a few dimensions of variables, exploiting prior information of the category-level is essential. A prior distribution used in variational autoencoders is simply assumed to be isotropic Gaussian regardless of the labels of each training datapoint. This type of flattened prior makes it difficult to perform imputation from the category-level distributions. We overcome this limitation by exploiting a category-specific multi-modal prior distribution in the latent space. The missing elements of the partially transferred data can be sampled, by finding a specific modal according to the remaining elements. Since the method is designed to use partial elements for anytime estimation, it can also be applied for data over-compression. Based on the experiments on the ModelNet and Pascal3D datasets, the proposed approach shows consistently superior performance over autoencoder and variational autoencoder up to 70% data loss.

However, many of the current well-known PRTSA methods suffer from excessive training time and complex tuning of parameters, resulting in inefficiency for real-time implementation and lacking the online model updating ability. In this paper, a novel PRTSA approach based on an ensemble of OS-extreme learning machine (EOSELM) with binary Jaya (BinJaya)-based feature selection is proposed with the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs) data. After briefly describing the principles of OS-ELM, an EOS-ELM-based PRTSA model is built to predict the post-fault transient stability status of power systems in real time by integrating OS-ELM and an online boosting algorithm, respectively, as a weak classifier and an ensemble learning algorithm. Furthermore, a BinJaya-based feature selection approach is put forward for selecting an optimal feature subset from the entire feature space constituted by a group of system-level classification features extracted from PMU data. The application results on the IEEE 39-bus system and a real provincial system show that the proposal has superior computation speed and prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art sequential learning algorithms.

Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance.

By using deep learning-based techniques, hashing can outperform non-learning-based hashing technique in many applications. However, we argue that the current deep learning-based hashing methods ignore some critical problems (e.g., the learned hash codes are not discriminative due to the hashing methods being unable to discover rich semantic information and the training strategy having difficulty optimizing the discrete binary codes). In this paper, we propose a novel image hashing method, termed as asymmetric deep semantic quantization (ADSQ). The ADSQ is implemented using three stream frameworks, which consist of one LabelNet and two ImgNets. The LabelNet leverages the power of three fully-connected layers, which are used to capture rich semantic information between image pairs. For the two ImgNets, they each adopt the same convolutional neural network structure but with different weights (i.e., asymmetric convolutional neural networks). The two ImgNets are used to generate discriminative compact hash codes. Specifically, the function of the LabelNet is to capture rich semantic information that is used to guide the two ImgNets in minimizing the gap between the real-continuous features and the discrete binary codes. Furthermore, the ADSQ can utilize the most critical semantic information to guide the feature learning process and consider the consistency of the common semantic space and Hamming space. The experimental results on three benchmarks (i.e., CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet) demonstrate that the proposed ADSQ can outperform current state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730353/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

We show that in our approach, the best mapping is able to approximate the best arm selection policy to any desired degree under mild Lipschitz conditions. Therefore, we design our algorithm based on the optimal adaptive combination and asymptotically achieve the performance of the best mapping as well as the best arm selection policy. This optimality is also guaranteed to hold even in adversarial environments since we do not rely on any statistical assumptions regarding the contexts or the loss of the bandit arms. Moreover, we design an efficient implementation for our algorithm using various hierarchical partitioning structures, such as lexicographical or arbitrary position splitting and binary trees (BTs) (and several other partitioning examples). For instance, in the case of BT partitioning, the computational complexity is only log-linear in the number of regions in the finest partition. In conclusion, we provide significant performance improvements by introducing upper bounds (with respect to the best arm selection policy) that are mathematically proven to vanish in the average loss per round sense at a faster rate compared to the state of the art.

In a range of extensive experiments, three different optimization strategies are used to automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available data sets. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial for different predictive models.

The rules of each module employ the adequate fuzzy operators for its task (making a decision or generating a smoothly varying control output), and they have been obtained from heuristic knowledge and numerical data (with geometric information) depending on the module requirements (some of them are constrained to provide paths of near-minimal lengths). The computer-aided design tools of the environment Xfuzzy 3.0 (developed by some of the authors) have been employed to automate the different design stages: 1) translation of heuristic knowledge into fuzzy rules; 2) extraction of fuzzy rules from numerical data and their tuning to give paths of near-minimal lengths; 3) offline verification of the control system behavior; and 4) its synthesis to be implemented in a true robot and be verified on line.

10.1109/TVT.2021.3136670,Autonomous Pilot of Unmanned Surface Vehicles: Bridging Path Planning and Tracking,IEEE,Journals,"Autonomous pilot is crucial in integrally promoting the autonomy of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). However, the integration mechanism of decision and control is still unclear within the entire autonomy. In this paper, by organically bridging path planning and tracking, an autonomous pilot framework with waypoints generation, path smoothing and policy guidance of a USV in congested waters is established, for the first time. Incorporating elite and diversity operations into the genetic algorithm (GA), an elite-duplication GA (EGA) strategy is devised to optimally generate sparse waypoints in a constrained space. The B-spline technique is further deployed to make flexibly smooth interpolation facilitating path smoothing supported by optimal sparse-waypoints. Seamlessly bridged by the parametric smooth path, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is resorted to continuously extract in-depth pilotage policies, i.e., mappings from path tracking errors, collision risks and control constraints to continuous control forces/torques. Eventually, the entire spline-bridged EGA-DRL (SED) framework merits autonomous global-pilotage and local-reaction in an organically modular manner. Comprehensive validations and comparisons in various real-world geographies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SED autonomous pilot framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9656611/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,March 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/TPAMI.2013.201,Bayesian Nonparametric Models for Multiway Data Analysis,IEEE,Journals,"Tensor decomposition is a powerful computational tool for multiway data analysis. Many popular tensor decomposition approaches—such as the Tucker decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)—amount to multi-linear factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between data entities, (ii) various data types (e.g., missing data and binary data), and (iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose tensor-variate latent nonparametric Bayesian models for multiway data analysis. We name these models InfTucker. These new models essentially conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature space. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, our new approaches handle both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent Gaussian or <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$t$ </tex-math></inline-formula> processes with nonlinear covariance functions. Moreover, on network data, our models reduce to nonparametric stochastic blockmodels and can be used to discover latent groups and predict missing interactions. To learn the models efficiently from data, we develop a variational inference technique and explore properties of the Kronecker product for computational efficiency. Compared with a classical variational implementation, this technique reduces both time and space complexities by several orders of magnitude. On real multiway and network data, our new models achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than state-of-art tensor decomposition methods and blockmodels.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6629993/,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,Feb. 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930236,Bayesian Signal Recovery Under Measurement Matrix Uncertainty: Performance Analysis,IEEE,Journals,"Compressive sensing (CS) has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to its benefits in saving measurement time and storage cost in many applications including biomedical imaging, wireless communications, image reconstruction, remote sensing, and so on. The CS framework enables signal recovery from a small number of linear measurements with an acceptable fidelity taking advantage of signal sparsity in some potentially unknown domain. The core idea of different variants of CS methods is incorporating prior knowledge about the input signal (e.g., prior distribution or sparsity of signals) into the recovery algorithm to restrict the search space and enhance the signal recovery performance. However, the accuracy of signal reconstruction can be significantly compromised if the designed and implemented measurement matrices do not fully match. Often times, the measurement matrix mismatch is treated as an additional noise term in the recovery algorithm ignoring the fact that this mismatch is a learnable quantity which includes random but constant or slow-varying terms during the lifetime of the measurement system. In this paper, we consider this problem for a simple case of Gaussian prior with a sparsity-driven diagonal covariance matrix and find strict bounds on the deviation of the reconstructed signal from the optimal case of fully known measurement matrix based on the properties of the mismatch matrix. The obtained bounds are general, and hence can be used to assess the performance of learning algorithms designed for learning measurement matrix uncertainty and eliminating its effect from the signal recovery. We provide numerical results to illustrate this concept in real-world applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8768029/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

In this case, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) method for intelligent fault diagnosis of bearing, which can largely satisfy the need of less parameter amount and storage space as well as high accuracy. First, depthiwise separable convolution is adopted, and a LCNN structure is constructed through an inverse residual structure and a linear bottleneck layer operation. Secondly, a novel decomposed Hierarchical Search Space is introduced to automatically explore the optimal LCNN for bearing fault diagnosis in the context of the IIoT.

They support fast element insertion and deletion, along with membership queries with the drawback of false positives. Bloom filters can be designed to match the false positive rates that are acceptable for the application domain. However, in many applications, a common engineering solution is to set the false positive rate very small and ignore the existence of the very unlikely false positive answers. This article is devoted to close the gap between the two design concepts of <i>unlikely</i> and <i>not having</i> false positives. We propose a data structure called EGH filter that supports the Bloom filter operations, and besides, it can guarantee false positive free operations for a finite universe and a restricted number of elements stored in the filter. We refer to the limited universe and filter size as the false positive free zone of the filter. We describe necessary conditions for the false-positive free zone of a filter. We then generalize the filter to support the listing of the elements through the use of counters rather than bits. We detail networking applications of the filter and discuss potential generalizations. We evaluate the performance of the filter in comparison with the traditional Bloom filters. We also evaluate the price in terms of memory that needs to be paid to guarantee real false positive-free operations for having a deterministic Bloom filter-like behavior.

To avoid potential faults caused by possible implementation bugs, checking the output SA from any IS sorter without engineering warranty for correctness is a de-facto process. The existing SA checkers commonly perform checking after an SA is built completely, with significant time and space complexities compared with that of builders. This article proposes an efficient solution for building and checking SA simultaneously by enhancing the original IS method with a checking scheme using hash computations to on-the-fly verify the results produced by the last induction phase of IS method. Given an input of constant alphabet, this checking scheme requires linear time and constant RAM space when running on external memory, and its time and space overheads are negligible compared with that for building SA. In our experiments on real-world data, the proposed methods take advantages over the counterparts of existing SA checkers by running faster with less space. This work can help provide a value-added bonus feature for open-source IS sorters to guarantee the correctness of a built SA, and such a feature should be desirable for applications using these sorters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9362262/,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1 April 2022,ieeexplore

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings.

Furthermore, the combinatorial nature of MS&amp;RA has forced the majority of existing proposals to focus on constrained scenarios or offline solutions to contain the size of the problem. Given the real-time constraints in actual deployments, a reduction in computational complexity is necessary. Adaptability is another key requirement for mobile networks that are exposed to constant changes such as channel quality fluctuations and mobility. In this article, we propose an online learning technique (i.e., CBMoS) which leverages combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) to tackle the combinatorial nature of MS&amp;RA. Furthermore, our two-stage CMAB design results in a tight model, which eliminates the theoretically feasible but practicality invalid options from the solution space. We prototype the first SDR-based D2D testbed to verify the performance of CBMoS under real-world conditions. The simulations confirm that the fast learning speed of CBMoS leads to outperforming the benchmark schemes by up to 132%. In experiments, CBMoS exhibits even higher performance (up to 142%) than in the simulations. This stems from the adaptability/fast learning speed of CBMoS in presence of high channel dynamics which cannot be captured via statistical channel models used in the simulators.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8790776/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

From these invariants, constraint equations for the intrinsic parameters of catadioptric camera are derived. Therefore, there are two kinds of variants of this novel method. The first one uses projections of lines and the second one uses projections of spheres. In general, the projections of two lines or three spheres are sufficient to achieve catadioptric camera calibration. One important conclusion in this paper is that the method based on projections of spheres is more robust and has higher accuracy than that based on projections of lines.

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements.

One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from wireless signals, namely, noncryptographic device identification (NDI). However, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to operational variations, such a paradigm is termed as incremental learning (IL). Various IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated space to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they are not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. Besides, conventional IL schemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not available. In this article, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new perspective, first, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of topological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of class-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for performance degradation in IL-enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices’ fingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to low topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems.

This research aims to develop an intelligent model to guide the stencil cleaning profiles’ decision-making and improve the SPP performance.

However, classical TSK FS usually adopts the whole feature space of the data for model construction, which can result in lengthy rules for high-dimensional data and lead to degeneration in interpretability. Furthermore, for highly nonlinear modeling task, it is usually necessary to use a large number of rules which further weaken the clarity and interpretability of TSK FS. To address these issues, an enhanced soft subspace clustering (ESSC) and sparse learning (SL) based concise zero-order TSK FS construction method, called ESSC-SL-CTSK-FS, is proposed in this paper by integrating the techniques of ESSC and SL. In this method, ESSC is used to generate the antecedents and various sparse subspaces for different fuzzy rules, whereas SL is used to optimize the consequent parameters of the fuzzy rules based on which the number of fuzzy rules can be effectively reduced. Finally, the proposed ESSC-SL-CTSK-FS method is used to construct concise zero-order TSK FS that can explain the scenes in high-dimensional data modeling more clearly and easily.

In this article, a noise-resilient and real-time detection system, named ContainerGuard, is proposed to detect meltdown and spectre attacks in the container-based big data platform. ContainerGuard uses a nonintrusive manner to collect lifecycle multivariate time-series performance event data of processes in containers and then uses ensemble of variational autoencoders as generative neural networks to learn the robust representations of normal patterns.

A service function chain (SFC) is composed of a sequential set of VNFs. As VNFs are vulnerable to various faults such as software failures, we consider how to deploy both active and standby SFC instances. Given the complexity and unpredictability of the network state, we propose a double deep Q-networks based online SFC placement scheme DDQP. Specifically, DDQP uses deep neural networks to deal with large continuous network state space. In the case of stateful VNFs, we offer constant generated state updates from active instances to standby instances to guarantee seamless redirection after failures. With the goal of balancing the waste of resources and ensuring service reliability, we introduce five progressive schemes of resource reservations to meet different customer needs. Our experimental results demonstrate that DDQP responds rapidly to arriving requests and reaches near-optimal performance. Specifically, DDQP outweighs the state-of-the-art method by 16.30% and 38.51% higher acceptance ratio under different schemes with 82x speedup on average. In order to enhance the integrity of the SFC state transition, we further proposed DDQP+, which extends DDQP by adding the delayed placement mechanism.

The huge influx of data creates new challenges for storage and transmission. This paper proposes a novel adaptive particle swarm optimization-based memetic algorithm (POMA) for DNA sequence compression. POMA is a synergy of comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) and an adaptive intelligent single particle optimizer (AdpISPO)-based local search. It takes advantage of both CLPSO and AdpISPO to optimize the design of approximate repeat vector (ARV) codebook for DNA sequence compression. ARV is first introduced in this paper to represent the repeated fragments across multiple sequences in direct, mirror, pairing, and inverted patterns. In POMA, candidate ARV codebooks are encoded as particles and the optimal solution, which covers the most approximate repeated fragments with the fewest base variations, is identified through the exploration and exploitation of POMA. In each iteration of POMA, the leader particles in the swarm are selected based on weighted fitness values and each leader particle is fine-tuned with an AdpISPO-based local search, so that the convergence of the search in local region is accelerated. A detailed comparison study between POMA and the counterpart algorithms is performed on 29 (23 basic and 6 composite) benchmark functions and 11 real DNA sequences. POMA is observed to obtain better or competitive performance with a limited number of function evaluations. POMA also attains lower bits-per-base than other state-of-the-art DNA-specific algorithms on DNA sequence data.

The control strategy of the manipulator includes the use of the joystick to generate the Cartesian space trajectory followed by the IK to yield the joint space trajectory for implementing position control. In this paper, a novel technique for the IK is proposed. It involves the use of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the inverse Jacobian (IJ). The special case of the dual PSO is based on dividing the PSO algorithm into two such that the trajectory position and orientation are separately optimized by the algorithms, resulting in a faster convergence. In contrast, the inverse Jacobian aids in generating a smooth joint trajectory. The integral sliding mode control (ISMC) is proposed for position control because it does not require information on system dynamics. The ISMC improves the system trajectory tracking performance by using a switching gain to compensate for system dynamics and perturbations (disturbance and unmatched uncertainties), ultimately reducing the time delay.

These algorithms are useful when the amount of time or memory resources are limited, or a rapid response time is required. An example of such a problem is pathfinding in video games where numerous units may be simultaneously required to react promptly to a player's commands. Classic real-time heuristic search algorithms cannot be deployed due to their obvious state revisitation (“scrubbing”). Recent algorithms have improved performance by using a database of precomputed subgoals. However, a common issue is that the precomputation time can be large, and there is no guarantee that the precomputed data adequately cover the search space. In this paper, we present a new approach that guarantees coverage by abstracting the search space, using the same algorithm that performs the real-time search. It reduces the precomputation time via the use of dynamic programming.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Deep Image-to-Video Adaptation and Fusion Networks (DIVAFN), to enhance action recognition in videos by transferring knowledge from images using video keyframes as a bridge. The DIVAFN is a unified deep learning model, which integrates domain-invariant representations learning and cross-modal feature fusion into a unified optimization framework. Specifically, we design an efficient cross-modal similarities metric to reduce the modality shift among images, keyframes and videos. Then, we adopt an autoencoder architecture, whose hidden layer is constrained to be the semantic representations of the action class names. In this way, when the autoencoder is adopted to project the learned features from different domains to the same space, more compact, informative and discriminative representations can be obtained. Finally, the concatenation of the learned semantic feature representations from these three autoencoders are used to train the classifier for action recognition in videos.

However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-learning to learn the shortest path on the building model’s graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actor–critic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces.

10.1109/TPAMI.2020.2964173,Deep Residual Correction Network for Partial Domain Adaptation,IEEE,Journals,"Deep domain adaptation methods have achieved appealing performance by learning transferable representations from a well-labeled source domain to a different but related unlabeled target domain. Most existing works assume source and target data share the identical label space, which is often difficult to be satisfied in many real-world applications. With the emergence of big data, there is a more practical scenario called partial domain adaptation, where we are always accessible to a more large-scale source domain while working on a relative small-scale target domain. In this case, the conventional domain adaptation assumption should be relaxed, and the target label space tends to be a subset of the source label space. Intuitively, reinforcing the positive effects of the most relevant source subclasses and reducing the negative impacts of irrelevant source subclasses are of vital importance to address partial domain adaptation challenge. This paper proposes an efficiently-implemented Deep Residual Correction Network (DRCN) by plugging one residual block into the source network along with the task-specific feature layer, which effectively enhances the adaptation from source to target and explicitly weakens the influence from the irrelevant source classes. Specifically, the plugged residual block, which consists of several fully-connected layers, could deepen basic network and boost its feature representation capability correspondingly. Moreover, we design a weighted class-wise domain alignment loss to couple two domains by matching the feature distributions of shared classes between source and target.

In this paper we study the DSN scheduling problem, which is the problem of assigning the DSN’s limited resources to its users within a given time horizon. The DSN scheduling problem is oversubscribed, meaning that only a subset of the activities can be scheduled, and network operators must decide which activities to exclude from the schedule.

This paper studies a practical yet important problem in those systems: how to deploy and manage their infrastructure across space and time, so that the services are <i>ubiquitous</i> to the users while <i>sustainable</i> in profitability. However, in real-world systems evaluating the performance of different deployment strategies and then finding the optimal plan is prohibitively expensive, as it is often infeasible to conduct many iterations of trial-and-error. We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation environment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility systems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the real-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the optimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the real-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search approach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative deployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a multi-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are used to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed loop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating better deployment plans in future iterations.

Differing from the traditional strategies of “sliding window” in anomaly detection, our method first defined six meta-features to statistically describe the local dynamics of a 1-D sequence with arbitrary length. Second, multivariate time series was converted to a new 1-D sequence, so that each of its segmented subsequence was represented as one sample with six meta-features. Finally, the anomaly detection of univariate/multivariate time series was implemented by identifying the outliers from the samples in a 6-D transformed space. In order to validate the effectiveness of MFAD, we applied our method on various univariate and multivariate time series datasets, including six well-known standard datasets (e.g. ECG and Air Quality) and eight real-world datasets in shield tunneling construction.

Detecting isolate safe areas is significant for various applications of event and disaster monitoring since valuable real-time information can be provided for the rescue crew to save persons who are trapped in isolate safe areas. We propose a centralized method to detect isolate safe areas via discovering holes in event areas. In order to shorten the detection delay, a distributed isolate safe area detection method is studied. The distributed method detects isolate safe areas during the process of event detection.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071795,Developing Software Signature Search Engines Using Paragraph Vector Model: A Triage Approach for Digital Forensics,IEEE,Journals,"Today, with the growth of information and communication technology, digital crimes have also spread. Advanced storage technologies and their low cost have led to a significant increase in their use. Therefore, the high volume of digital data to be analyzed is a challenge facing digital forensic investigators. Digital forensic triage solutions aim to alleviate the forensic backlog. A promising triage technique is to quickly find the software packages run on the target system to narrow down the search space. In this paper, we propose a software signature search engine (S3E) to identify software on the system under investigation. The document collection of this search engine consists of software signatures, and the query is the features extracted from the system's hard disk. We propose a forensic differential analysis model to build software signatures. Besides, we use the paragraph vector model to construct the corresponding vectors of each software signature and find similarities between the query vector and the signature vectors. Different design parameters are involved in making software signature search engines, and distinct values of these parameters lead to different models. We have measured the performance of these S3E models against several controlled systems and some pseudo-real systems. The experimental results on both datasets show that some S3E models achieve perfect recall, and many of them have a recall of more than 90%. Besides, we find that the recall rate of the S3E models in both datasets is higher than the averaged word2vec model and the TF-IDF model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399093/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

When the number of transmit antennas n=1, 2, or n is a multiple of four, we spread a rotated version of the information symbol vector by the Hadamard transform and send it over n transmit antennas and n time periods; for other values of n, we construct the codes by sending the components of a rotated version of the information symbol vector over the diagonal of an n /spl times/ n ST code matrix. The codes maintain their rate, diversity, and coding gains for all real and complex constellations carved from the complex integers ring Z [i], and they outperform the codes from orthogonal design when using complex constellations for n &gt; 2.

10.1109/TIP.2019.2892703,Discrete Hashing With Multiple Supervision,IEEE,Journals,"Supervised hashing methods have achieved more promising results than unsupervised ones by leveraging label information to generate compact and accurate hash codes. Most of the prior supervised hashing methods construct an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n\times n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> instance-pairwise similarity matrix, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the number of training samples. Nevertheless, this kind of similarity matrix results in high memory space cost and makes the optimization time-consuming, making it unacceptable in many real applications. In addition, most of the methods relax the discrete constraints to solve the optimization problem, which may cause large quantization errors and finally lead to poor performance. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present a novel hashing method, named discrete hashing with multiple supervision (MSDH). MSDH supervises the hash code learning with both class-wise and instance-class similarity matrices, whose space cost is much less than the instance-pairwise similarity matrix. With multiple supervision information, better hash codes can be learned. Besides, an iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to directly learn the discrete hash codes instead of relaxing the binary constraints.

To handle this problem, we propose an effective distance metric learning method-based LDA, namely, Euler LDA-L21 (e-LDA-L21). e-LDA-L21 is carried out in two stages, in which each image is mapped into a complex space by Euler transform in the first stage and the ℓ<sub>2,1</sub>-norm is adopted as the distance metric in the second stage. This not only reveals nonlinear features but also exploits the geometric structure of data. To solve e-LDA-L21 efficiently, we propose an iterative algorithm, which is a closed-form solution at each iteration with convergence guaranteed. Finally, we extend e-LDA-L21 to Euler 2DLDA-L21 (e-2DLDA-L21) which further exploits the spatial information embedded in image pixels.

The proposed DJFNN involves a novel network architecture and a greedy learning algorithm. Being different from the existing grid-based and clustering-based network architectures, the proposed architecture adds an OR neural layer positioned between the fuzzification layer and the rule layer. In this way, the implied constraint between the number of rules and the number of fuzzy labels is excluded so that a curse of dimensionality can be overcome and more interpretable models are formed. Furthermore, inspired by the core algorithm for building a decision tree, a top–down, nonbacktracking, and greedy algorithm is proposed to learn the unknown parameters of the networks. The input space splits into smaller and smaller subspace along the predefined fuzzy grids in a supervised manner meanwhile the associated conditions of the T–S fuzzy model are identified. The greedy algorithm is applicable to high-dimensional problems since there is no exponential growth in time or space as the dimensionality increases. The new network architecture and greedy learning algorithm make the proposed DJFNN a regression model of high interpretability and good prediction capability, particularly suitable for solving the high-dimensional problems. The DJFNN was experimented with using a synthetic dataset and 28 real-world datasets and compared with classical and state-of-the-art methods through nonparametric statistical tests. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the DJFNN in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9264752/,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,Feb. 2022,ieeexplore

In converged networks, broadcasting networks can push non-real-time popular services to different types of terminals during off-peak hours, while cellular networks are deployed to meet personalized needs. However, the storage capacity of terminals are usually limited. In this context, we study on the converged networks to push and cache the popular services in the router nodes close to the terminators. In this scheme, the most popular services are transmitted by the broadcasting base station and cached in the router nodes in a distributed cache network. Then, users can access the cached services in a more energy efficient manner. Due to the limited storage capacity of the router node, we assume that the user can access the cached services within two hops. Then, we formulate the service scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process, aiming to maximize equivalent throughput (ET). Due to the large state space involved in the distributed cache network, it is quite challenging to obtain a tractable solution by the classical optimization algorithms. To handle this problem, a deep reinforcement learning based framework is proposed to tackle this problem. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are very effective; and they outperform the conventional one in term of the ET, especially when the users in the network subject to Poisson point process distribution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9107459/,IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting,March 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TAC.2019.2955999,Distributed Mechanism Design With Learning Guarantees for Private and Public Goods Problems,IEEE,Journals,"Mechanism design for fully strategic agents typically assumes that agents broadcast their messages to a central authority that performs allocation and taxes/subsidizes agents. In addition, most of the designed mechanisms do not provide any guarantees that the Nash equilibrium (NE) will be reached asymptotically. Whenever such results are provided, they refer to convergence of specific predesigned learning dynamics and it is assumed that agents will follow such prescription. Both assumptions are an impediment in practical application of mechanism design in real-life allocation problems. In this article, we consider two common resource allocation problems: sharing K infinitely divisible resources among strategic agents for their private consumption (private goods), and determining the level for an infinitely divisible public good with P features, that is shared between strategic agents. For both cases, we present a distributed mechanism for a set of agents who communicate through a given network. In a distributed mechanism, agents' messages are not broadcasted to all other agents as in the standard mechanism design framework, but are exchanged only in the local neighborhood of each agent. The presented mechanisms produce a unique NE, they fully implement the social welfare maximizing allocation, and are budget-balanced at NE. Subsequently, it is shown that the mechanisms induce a game with contractive best-response, leading to guaranteed convergence for all learning dynamics within the adaptive best-response dynamics class, including dynamics such as Cournot best-response, k-period best-response, and Fictitious Play. While the abovementioned mechanisms have message dimensionality that grows quadratically with the number of agents, we show that if one is willing to forgo the strong convergence guarantees, it is possible to design a distributed mechanism with total message space dimensionality growing only linearly with the number of agents. Finally, we demonstrate the abovementioned results through a numerical study of convergence under repeated play, for various communication graphs and learning dynamics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8913590/,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

The measurement range of azimuth sensor is taken into consideration when doing problem formulation, which is closer to the facts in real-world applications. Then, the fully distributed control protocols are put forward based on geometric principle and the convergence is proved strictly with algebraic method. The proposed control protocols can steer the mobile agents to distribute evenly on the circle such that the coverage cost function is minimized, and meanwhile the mobile agents' spatial order on the circle is preserved throughout the systems' evolution. A noteworthy feature of the proposed control protocols is that only the azimuths of a mobile agent and its two adjacent neighbors are needed to calculate the mobile agent's control input, so that the control protocols can be easily implemented in general. Moreover, an adjustable feedback gain is introduced, and it can be employed to improve the convergence rate effectively.

In order to enlarge margins between different classes and preserve the intrinsic geometry structure of samples in the transformed space, we will propose dynamic graph regularization and label relaxation-based SMR (abbreviated as DGRLR-SMR) method for two-dimensional supervised feature selection. First, the label relaxation SMR is established by relaxing the strict binary label matrix into a slack variable matrix via a nonnegative label relaxation matrix by the $\varepsilon $ -dragging technique. Second, we construct a dynamic graph matrix learning model, rather than using the heat kernel function to obtain a fixed graph matrix, to capture the discriminative information and the local manifold structure of the image samples. Therefore, the proposed model not only enlarges margins between different classes, but also obtains a sparse transformation matrix and avoids the problem of over-fitting.

Despite this, automated approaches to remodularisation tend to ignore domain knowledge, leading to results that can be nonsensical to developers. Nevertheless, suppling such knowledge is a potentially burdensome task to perform manually. A lot information may need to be specified, particularly for large systems. Addressing these concerns, we propose the SUpervised reMOdularisation (SUMO) approach. SUMO is a technique that aims to leverage a small subset of domain knowledge about a system to produce a remodularisation that will be acceptable to a developer. With SUMO, developers refine a modularisation by iteratively supplying corrections. These corrections constrain the type of remodularisation eventually required, enabling SUMO to dramatically reduce the solution space. This in turn reduces the amount of feedback the developer needs to supply. We perform a comprehensive systematic evaluation using 100 real world subject systems.

Firstly, the long-term optimal control is developed using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP). Thereafter, the obtained PMP solution is used to bound the state space for a computationally tractable Dynamic Programming (DP) optimisation to ensure the satisfaction of the safety constraints. While the acceleration subproblem solution is similar to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), the combination of regenerative and hydraulic braking significantly alters the nature of the optimal braking profile. Since a DP solution is not tractable for real-time implementation of combined braking, a fast heuristic is developed, which achieves 98% of the optimal energy recovery calculated by the DP in the simulated cases.

While most of existing machine learning (ML) algorithms just focus on fine tuning the hyperparameters of the classifiers, our ML algorithm, GBTD, focuses on the feature engineering-based preprocessing to improve detection performance as well as time-complexity. GBTD improves both detection rate and false positive rate (FPR) of those GBCs by generating stochastic features like standard deviation, mean, minimum, and maximum value of daily electricity usage. GBTD also reduces the classifier complexity with weighted featureimportance-based extraction techniques. Emphasis has been laid upon the practical application of the proposed ML for theft detection by minimizing FPR and reducing data storage space and improving time-complexity of the GBTD classifiers. Additionally, this letter proposes an updated version of the existing six theft cases to mimic real-world theft patterns and applies them to the dataset for numerical evaluation of the proposed algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8610248/,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,March 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014185,Entity Thematic Similarity Measurement for Personal Explainable Searching Services in the Edge Environment,IEEE,Journals,"Currently, search engines are widely used to address the information overload problem. Different from the existing client-and-sever-based frameworks, edge computing (EC) technology can provide a new architecture for personalized searching services. The issue of how to measure the similarities among entities by using the context information generated by user behavior in the edge environment is vital in the task of entity-related personal searching. To analyze and measure the similarities among entities, existing methods are mainly based on either the textual content or relationships unilaterally, and the results usually have a fixed degree of similarity. However, the similarities among entities depend on the set of properties that belong to the entities. This approach should be used in determining the similarity or dissimilarity associated with the surrounding context. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic augmentation method with a double attention mechanism. The method refers to a dynamic representation learning process that maps an entity to a real number vector in semantic space. In this article, different from the existing similarity measurement methods, we propose a thematic similarity measure approach to analyze the connotation and denotation similarities among entities. The experimental results show that the double attention mechanism leads to a significant improvement in the entity thematic similarity measurement tasks. The model can make a separation among the entities from different domains effectively. In addition, it can take similar entities that are closer in the same domain. It also shows excellent performance on the task of entity thematic similarity, which makes the recommendation results more explainable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157841/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

However, the complexity of this ecosystem is a direct cause of one of the most important problems in online advertising, the lack of transparency. This lack of transparency enables subsequent problems such as advertising fraud, which causes billions of dollars in losses. In this paper we propose Ads.chain, a technological solution to the lack-of-transparency problem in programmatic advertising. Ads.chain extends the current effort of the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) in providing traceability in online advertising through the Ads.txt and Ads.cert solutions, addressing the limitations of these techniques. Ads.chain is (to the best of the authors' knowledge) the first solution that provides end-to-end cryptographic traceability at the ad transaction level. It is a communication protocol that can be seamlessly embedded into ad-tags and the OpenRTB protocol, the de-facto standards for communications in online advertising, allowing an incremental adoption by the industry. We have implemented Ads.chain and made the code publicly available. We assess the performance of Ads.chain through a thorough analysis in a lab environment that emulates a real ad delivery process at real-life throughputs. The obtained results show that Ads.chain can be implemented with limited impact on the hardware resources and marginal delay increments at the publishers lower than 0.20 milliseconds per ad space on webpages and 2.6 milliseconds at the programmatic advertising platforms.

Evidence indicates that enrollments are rising, yet attendance is falling due to diverse demands on student time and easy access to online content. This paper outlines our efforts to address classroom under-utilization in a real university campus arising from the gap between enrollment and attendance. We do so by instrumenting classrooms with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to measure real-time usage, using AI to predict attendance, and performing optimal allocation of rooms to courses so as to minimize space wastage. Our first contribution undertakes an evaluation of several IoT sensing approaches for measuring class occupancy, and comparing them in terms of cost, accuracy, privacy, and ease of deployment/operation. Our second contribution instruments nine lecture halls of varying capacity across campus, collects and cleans live occupancy data spanning about 250 courses over two sessions, and draws insights into attendance patterns, including identification of canceled lectures and class tests, while also releasing our data openly to the public. Our third contribution is to use AI techniques for predicting classroom attendance, applying them to real data, and accurately predicting future attendance with an root-mean-square error as low as 0.16.

Although photographers are able to create composites of analog pictures, this process is very time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Today, however, powerful digital image editing software makes image modifications straightforward. This undermines our trust in photographs and, in particular, questions pictures as evidence for real-world events. In this paper, we analyze one of the most common forms of photographic manipulation, known as image composition or splicing. We propose a forgery detection method that exploits subtle inconsistencies in the color of the illumination of images. Our approach is machine-learning-based and requires minimal user interaction. The technique is applicable to images containing two or more people and requires no expert interaction for the tampering decision. To achieve this, we incorporate information from physics- and statistical-based illuminant estimators on image regions of similar material. From these illuminant estimates, we extract texture- and edge-based features which are then provided to a machine-learning approach for automatic decision-making. The classification performance using an SVM meta-fusion classifier is promising.

Our method builds upon the idea of the information bottleneck, by introducing an additional penalty term that encourages the Fisher information of the extracted features to be small when parametrized by the inputs. We present two formulations where the relevance of the features to output labels is measured using either mutual information or MMSE. By tuning the regularization parameter, we can explicitly trade off the opposing desiderata of robustness and accuracy when constructing a classifier. We derive optimal solutions to both robust information bottleneck formulations when the inputs and outputs are jointly Gaussian, proving that the optimally robust features are also jointly Gaussian in this setting. We also propose methods for optimizing variational bounds on the robust information bottleneck objectives in general settings using stochastic gradient descent, which may be implemented efficiently in neural networks.

Such a function can be represented by thousands of measurements (images) per material sample. The resulting BTF size excludes its direct rendering in graphical applications and some compression of these huge BTF data spaces is obviously inevitable. In this paper we present a novel, fast probabilistic model-based algorithm for realistic BTF modeling allowing an extreme compression with the possibility of a fast hardware implementation. Its ultimate aim is to create a visual impression of the same material without a pixel-wise correspondence to the original measurements. The analytical step of the algorithm starts with a BTF space segmentation and a range map estimation by photometric stereo of the BTF surface, followed by the spectral and spatial factorization of selected sub-space color texture images. Single mono-spectral band-limited factors are independently modeled by their dedicated spatial probabilistic model. During rendering, the sub-space images of arbitrary size are synthesized and both color (possibly multi-spectral) and range information is combined in a bump-mapping filter according to the view and illumination directions. The presented model offers a huge BTF compression ratio unattainable by any alternative sampling-based BTF synthesis method.

This single utterance could be of short duration depending on the ASR task. In these cases, robust estimation of speaker normalizing methods like feature-space maximum likelihood linear regression (FMLLR) and i-vectors may not be feasible. In this paper, we propose two unsupervised speaker normalization techniques-one at feature level and other at model level of acoustic modeling-to overcome the drawbacks of FMLLR and i-vectors in real-time scenarios. At feature level, we propose the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to generate pseudo-FMLLR features from time-synchronous pair of filterbank and FMLLR features. These pseudo-FMLLR features can then be used for DNN acoustic model training and decoding. At model level, we propose a generalized distillation framework, where a teacher DNN trained on FMLLR features guides the training and optimization of a student DNN trained on filterbank features. In both the proposed methods, the ambiguity in choosing the speaker-specific FMLLR transform can be reduced by augmenting i-vectors to the input filterbank features. Experiments conducted on 33-h and 110-h subsets of Switchboard corpus show that the proposed methods provide significant gains over DNNs trained on FMLLR, i-vector appended FMLLR, filterbank and i -vector appended filterbank features, in real-time scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8263609/,"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",April 2018,ieeexplore

To this end, this paper proposes a coarse-to-fine face super-resolution approach via a multilayer locality-constrained iterative neighbor embedding technique, which intends to represent the input LR patch while preserving the geometry of original HR space. In particular, we iteratively update the LR patch representation and the estimated HR patch, and meanwhile an intermediate dictionary learning scheme is employed to bridge the LR manifold and original HR manifold. The proposed method can faithfully capture the intrinsic image degradation shift and enhance the consistency between the reconstructed HR manifold and the original HR manifold.

Existing MIML approaches have been found useful in many applications; however, most of them can only handle moderate-sized data. To efficiently handle large data sets, in this paper we propose the MIMLfast approach, which first constructs a low-dimensional subspace shared by all labels, and then trains label specific linear models to optimize approximated ranking loss via stochastic gradient descent. Although the MIML problem is complicated, MIMLfast is able to achieve excellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and discovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the performance of MIMLfast is highly competitive to state-of-the-art techniques, whereas its time cost is much less.

Both assumptions are artificial and breached in real-world applications, since the probe population in target people search can be extremely vast in practice due to the ambiguity of probe search space boundary. Therefore, it is unrealistic that any probe person is assumed as one target people, and a large-scale search in person images is inherently demanded. In this paper, we introduce a new person re-id search setting, called large scale open-world (LSOW) re-id, characterized by huge size probe images and open person population in search thus more close to practical deployments. Under LSOW, the under-studied problem of person re-id efficiency is essential in addition to that of commonly studied re-id accuracy.

Video data is a rich source of information and considered the most demanding in terms of storage space. With the huge development of digital video production, video management becomes a challenging task. Video content analysis (VCA) aims to provide big data solutions by automating the video management. To this end, shot boundary detection (SBD) is considered an essential step in VCA. It aims to partition the video sequence into shots by detecting shot transitions. High computational cost in transition detection is considered a bottleneck for real-time applications. Thus, in this paper, a balance between detection accuracy and speed for SBD is addressed by presenting a new method for fast video processing. The proposed SBD framework is based on the concept of candidate segment selection with frame active area and separable moments. First, for each frame, the active area is selected such that only the informative content is considered. This leads to a reduction in the computational cost and disturbance factors. Second, for each active area, the moments are computed using orthogonal polynomials. Then, an adaptive threshold and inequality criteria are used to eliminate most of the non-transition frames and preserve candidate segments. For further elimination, two rounds of bisection comparisons are applied. As a result, the computational cost is reduced in the subsequent stages. Finally, machine learning statistics based on the support vector machine is implemented to detect the cut transitions. The enhancement of the proposed fast video processing method over existing methods in terms of computational complexity and accuracy is verified. The average improvements in terms of frame percentage and transition accuracy percentage are 1.63% and 2.05%, respectively.

However, initialization of the surface is critical for the final result and its main drawbacks are very slow convergence and the huge number of iterations required.

An enormous amount of data concerning the trajectories of vehicles has been collected and stored for tracking purposes. A trajectory contains not only the footprints of a moving object but also additional information, such as speed and stopping points. Therefore, the large-scale trajectory data sets provide rich information and are currently attracting considerable attention; there have been many successful studies of event detection based on trajectory data. However, most of these studies have focused only on vehicles traveling in a road network and have note considered maritime trajectories. A maritime trajectory also contains auxiliary data (e.g., speed and rotation) in addition to the movements of a ship. However, ships are not bound to road networks, and consequently, it is difficult to apply traditional mining algorithms based on road networks. In addition, even if the amount of maritime trajectory data is very large, these data are also spatially sparse, which will significantly reduce the effectiveness of most existing mining algorithms.

This method can detect abnormal vessel trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS), records for vessels via our feature learning algorithm. To reduce the search space, we invoke reference points as well as the Piecewise Linear Segmentation (PLS), algorithm to compress the trajectories without losing important information. A time-aware and spatially correlated collaborative algorithm is proposed to increase the density of the trajectories to improve the accuracy of the detection algorithm, which is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Finally, we report experiments conducted on a real-world data set, which demonstrate that the proposed detection method can detect anomalous trajectories effectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7913665/,IEEE Access,2017,ieeexplore

To address these issues, this article proposes a lightweight algorithm for finger vein image recognition and matching. The proposed algorithm uses a lightweight convolutional model in the backbone network and employs a triplet loss function to train the model, which not only improves the matching accuracy, but also satisfies the real-time matching requirements. In addition, the Mini-region of interest (RoI) and finger vein pattern feature extraction also effectively solve the problems of large amounts of calculation and background noise. Moreover, the present model recognizes new categories based on the feature vector space constructed by the finger vein recognition system, so that new categories can be recognized without retraining the model. The results show that the finger vein recognition and matching algorithm proposed in this article achieves 99.3% and 99.6% in recognition accuracy and 14.2 and 16.5 ms in matching time for the dataset Shandong University Machine Learning and Applications Laboratory-Homologous Multimodal Biometric Traits (SDUMLA-HMT) and Peking University Finger Vein Dataset (PKU-FVD), respectively. These metrics show that our approach is time-saving and more effective than previous algorithms.

Target identification decisions are based on minimizing an energy function. This energy function is evaluated by comparing a candidate blob with a library of target models at several levels of resolution simultaneously available in the current foveal image. For this purpose, a concurrent (top-down-and-bottom-up) matching procedure is implemented via a novel multilayer Hopfield (1985) neural network. The associated energy function supports not only interactions between cells at the same resolution level, but also between sets of nodes at distinct resolution levels. This permits features at different resolution levels to corroborate or refute one another contributing to an efficient evaluation of potential matches. Gaze control, refoveation to more salient regions of the available image space, is implemented as a search for high resolution features which will disambiguate the candidate blob.

In such scenarios, tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven, functional contour-following task: the closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable, transparent, and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robot's pinch grasp. A Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (C-MAB) reinforcement learning algorithm was implemented to maximize cumulative rewards by balancing exploration versus exploitation of the state-action space. The C-MAB learner outperformed a benchmark Q-learner by more efficiently exploring the state-action space while learning a hard-to-code task. The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours (wire, rope). Importantly, this work contributes to the development of reinforcement learning approaches that account for limited resources such as hardware life and researcher time. As robots are used to perform complex, physically interactive tasks in unstructured or unmodeled environments, it becomes important to develop methods that enable efficient and effective learning with physical testbeds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8039205/,IEEE Transactions on Haptics,1 Jan.-March 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889930,Fuzzy Classification Using Pattern Discovery,IEEE,Journals,"Rule-based classifiers allow rationalization of classifications made. This in turn improves understanding which is essential for effective decision support. As a rule based classifier, the pattern discovery (PD) algorithm functions well in discrete, nominal and continuous data domains. A drawback when using PD as a classifier for decision support is that it has an unbounded decision space that confounds the understanding of the degree of support for a decision. Incorporating PD into a fuzzy inference system (FIS) allows the the degree of support for a decision to be expressed with intuitively understandable terms. In addition, using discrete algorithms in continuous domains can result in reduced accuracy due to quantization. Fuzzification reduces this ldquocost of quantizationrdquo and improves classification performance. In this work, the PD algorithm was used as a source of rules for a series of FISs implemented using different rule weighting and defuzzification schemes, each providing a linguistic basis for rule description and a bounded space for expression of decision support. The output of each FIS consists of a suggested outcome, a strong confidence metric describing suggestions within this space and a linguistic expression of the rules. This constitutes a stronger basis for decision making than that provided by PD alone. A variety of synthetic, continuous class distributions with varying degrees of separation was used to evaluate the performance of fuzzy, PD, back-propagation and Bayesian classifiers. Overall, the accuracy of the fuzzy system was found to be similar, but slightly below, that of the inherently continuous valued classifiers and was somewhat improved with respect to the PD classifiers. For the difficult spiral class distributions studied, the fuzzy classifiers were able to make more classifications than the PD classifiers. The correct classification rates for the fuzzy classifiers were similar across the various rule weighting and defuzzification schemes, demonstrating the strength of the statistical method for rule generation. Analysis of several real-world data sets shows that a PD-based FIS has comparable performance to a neuro-fuzzy system. The use of a PD based FIS however, provides insight into the structure of the data analyzed not available through the other approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4343108/,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,Oct. 2007,ieeexplore
10.1109/TASE.2020.3024725,Fuzzy Logic-Driven Variable Time-Scale Prediction-Based Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Multiple Peg-in-Hole Assembly,IEEE,Journals,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly used for single peg-in-hole assembly, where assembly skill is learned through interaction with the assembly environment in a manner similar to skills employed by human beings. However, the existing RL algorithms are difficult to apply to the multiple peg-in-hole assembly because the much more complicated assembly environment requires sufficient exploration, resulting in a long training time and less data efficiency. To this end, this article focuses on how to predict the assembly environment and how to use the predicted environment in assembly action control to improve the data efficiency of the RL algorithm. Specifically, first, the assembly environment is exactly predicted by a variable time-scale prediction (VTSP) defined as general value functions (GVFs), reducing the unnecessary exploration. Second, we propose a fuzzy logic-driven variable time-scale prediction-based reinforcement learning (FLDVTSP-RL) for assembly action control to improve the efficiency of the RL algorithm, in which the predicted environment is mapped to the impedance parameter in the proposed impedance action space by a fuzzy logic system (FLS) as the action baseline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VTSP and the data efficiency of the FLDVTSP-RL methods, a dual peg-in-hole assembly experiment is set up; the results show that FLDVTSP-deep Q-learning (DQN) decreases the assembly time about 44% compared with DQN and FLDVTSP-deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) decreases the assembly time about 24% compared with DDPG. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>—The complicated assembly environment of the multiple peg-in-hole assembly results in a contact state that cannot be recognized exactly from the force sensor. Therefore, contact-model-based methods that require tuning of the control parameters based on the contact state recognition cannot be applied directly in this complicated environment. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods without contact state recognition have recently attracted scientific interest. However, the existing RL methods still rely on numerous explorations and a long training time, which cannot be directly applied to real-world tasks. This article takes inspiration from the manner in which human beings can learn assembly skills with a few trials, which relies on the variable time-scale predictions (VTSPs) of the environment and the optimized assembly action control strategy. Our proposed fuzzy logic-driven variable time-scale prediction-based reinforcement learning (FLDVTSP-RL) can be implemented in two steps. First, the assembly environment is predicted by the VTSP defined as general value functions (GVFs). Second, assembly action control is realized in an impedance action space with a baseline defined by the impedance parameter mapped from the predicted environment by the fuzzy logic system (FLS). Finally, a dual peg-in-hole assembly experiment is conducted; compared with deep Q-learning (DQN), FLDVTSP-DQN can decrease the assembly time about 44%; compared with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), FLDVTSP-DDPG can decrease the assembly time about 24%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9210190/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Jan. 2022,ieeexplore

The situation may get worse when the planning in RTS games is implemented under a partially observable environment considering the existence of the fog-of-war. Given the recorded past positions of an agent, it would be helpful if the targets' next position can be predicted based on the recorded data since this will increase the certainty of the target. Therefore, this paper proposes a fuzzy theory-based single belief state generation method named FTH to do what based on multi-layer information sets extracted from the history position information. Besides, we incorporate the FTH generation method into adversarial hierarchical task network repairing (AHTNR) planning algorithm, which can be used for the prediction of the unit's position and task planning.

The proposed network consists of two generative architectures and one auxiliary learning component. The cycle generative architecture bridges the domain variance between the real bronchoscopic videos and virtual views derived from pre-operative CT data so that the proposed approach can be trained through a large number of generated virtual images but deployed through real images. The auxiliary learning architecture leverages complementary relative pose regression to constrain the search space, ensuring consistent global pose predictions. Most importantly, the uncertainty of each global pose is obtained through variational inference by sampling within the learned underlying probability distribution.

Most of the traditional group recommendation solutions regard group members as equal participants and assign a same weight to each member. As a result, performance of this type of recommendation methods is not as good as expected. To improve the performance of group recommendation, a novel group recommendation model via Self-Attention and Collaborative Metric Learning (SACML) is presented in this paper. With the employment of Self-Attention mechanism, the SACML model can learn the similarity interactions between group members and services and decide a different weight for different group member. Based on these weights, group preferences for services can be generated by the aggregation of group members' preferences and the group's own preference. Similar metric space between group and services is obtained via collaborative metric learning with the group preferences and positive and negative services' features.

However, wildcard rules introduce the rule dependency problem, which poses obstacles to preserve the semantics of network policies and design the timeout mechanism. Therefore, exploiting the limited flow table effectively as well as designing a safe timeout mechanism become the main challenge.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2804764,HotSpot: Anomaly Localization for Additive KPIs With Multi-Dimensional Attributes,IEEE,Journals,"Additive key performance indicators (KPIs) (such as page view (PV), revenue, and error count) with multi-dimensional attributes (such as ISP, Province, and DataCenter) are common and important in monitoring metrics in Internet companies. When an anomaly happens to an overall KPI, it is critical but challenging to localize the root cause, which is one (or more) combination of attribute values in multiple dimensions. For example, is the total PV decrease caused by the PV decrease from “Beijing”or “China Mobile in Beijing”, or “Beijing and Shanghai”? However, this task is very challenging for two major reasons. First, the PVs of different combinations are interdependent; thus, the PV anomalies at the root cause can cause the changes of many other PVs at different aggregation levels. Second, there could be tens of thousands of combinations to investigate in multi-dimensional attribute space. It is a difficulty to find the root cause from a huge search space. To address the first challenge, our approach HotSpot uses a novel potential score based on the ripple effect for anomaly propagation that we reveal. To address the second challenge, HotSpot adopts the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and a hierarchical pruning strategy. Using the real-world data from a top global search engine, we show that HotSpot achieves a great improvement on effectiveness and robustness, i.e., 95% of all types of root cause cases using HotSpot (compared with only 15% using existing approaches) achieves an F-score over 90%. Operational experiences show that HotSpot can reduce the localization time from more than 1 h in manual efforts to less than 20 s.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8288614/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

In this context, descriptive and predictive analytics has gained a significant research attention; however, prescriptive analytics has just started to emerge as the next step towards increasing data analytics maturity and leading to optimized decision making ahead of time. Although machine learning for decision making has been identified as one of the most important applications of AI, up to now, prescriptive analytics is mainly addressed with domain-specific optimization models. On the other hand, existing literature lacks generalized prescriptive analytics models capable of being dynamically adapted according to the human preferences. Reinforcement Learning, as the third machine learning paradigm alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning, has the potential to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and time-variant environments, the huge states space of sequential decision making processes, as well as the incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we propose a human-augmented prescriptive analytics approach using Interactive Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (IMORL) in order to cope with the complexity of real-life environments and the need for optimized human-machine collaboration. The decision making process is modelled in a generalized way in order to assure scalability and applicability in a wide range of problems and applications.

Smart sensing means faster and hardware-friendly imaging. Instead of acquiring all band samples in the spectral domain, we randomly select a few band samples per spatial pixel location. A periodic structure of spectral band selector array (SBSA) is designed so that we can learn a subspace basis from subsamples, which is essential to the underlying hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery algorithm. This spectral subsampling sensing strategy yields a demosaicing problem. We propose a blind hyperspectral reconstruction technique termed hyperspectral demosaicing (Hy-demosaicing) exploiting spectral low-rankness and spatial correlation of HSIs. It is blind in the sense that the signal subspace is learned from measured spectral subsamples. The subspace basis is data-adaptive and provides a more compact representation than other non-adaptive representations.

However, it is still a challenging task due to the highly uncertain and volatile nature of wind speed. Accordingly, in this work, a novel deep learning-based model integrating the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) is developed to precisely capture deep temporal features and learn the time-varying relationship of wind speed time series. In the proposed method, by applying the DWPT, both approximations and details parts are decomposed by passing through the filters to choose the frequency band related to the features of the original signal more adaptively. The BLSTM networks are incorporated to deal with the uncertainties more effectively as they have bidirectional memory capability (feedforward and feedback loops) to investigate both previous and future hidden layers data. To simultaneously improve the forecasting performance and decrease the learning complexity, the reconstructed state space of historical wind data is employed to reflect the evolution laws of wind speed. Two case studies using real-world wind speed datasets gathered from Flatirons campus (M2) of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) located in Colorado, USA and weather station of Edmonton, Canada are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed hybrid method compared to the shallow architectures and state-of-the-art deep learning models in the recent literature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9306756/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Two case studies are presented: an FMS cell and a press shop.

The scheduling problem, seen as a constraint satisfaction problem, can be approached with rule-based techniques. Nevertheless, algorithmic techniques are found to be valuable for their efficiency and ability to deal with aggregated data. This ability is fundamental for an efficient implementation of hierarchical control systems in general and in the manufacturing context in particular. This suggests that the integration of rule-based techniques with algorithmic ones can increase the efficiency of searching in the space of possible solutions. The ability to deal with aggregated data can have little value when detailed real-time operation scheduling is needed. In this case, simple dispatching rules are often used, and sophisticated operations research methods are not used.

Convolutional neural network(CNN), with the strong ability to extract features using the hidden layers in the network, has been introduced to solve this problem. However, several fully connected layers are always appended at the end of CNN, which dramatically reduced the efficiency of space utilization and make the classification algorithm hard to converge. Recently, a new network architecture called capsule network (CapsNet) was presented to improve the CNN. It uses groups of neurons as capsules to replace the neurons in traditional neural networks. Since the capsule can provide superior spectral features and spatial information extracted, its performance is better than the most advanced CNN in some fields. Motivated by this idea, a new remote sensing hyperspectral image classification algorithm called Conv-Caps is proposed to make full use of the advantages of both. We integrate spectral and spatial information into the proposed framework and combine Conv-Caps with Markov Random Field (MRF), which uses the graph cut expansion method to solve the classification task. The Caps-MRF method is further proposed. First, select an initial feature extractor, which a CNN without fully connected layers. Then, the initial recognition feature map is put into the newly designed CapsNet to obtain the probability map. Finally, the MRF model is used to calculate the subdivision labels.

Cell image denoising is a challenging task which has high requirement on the recovery of feature details. Current popular convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising methods encounter a blurriness issue that denoised images are blurry on texture details, which is fatal for the cell image denoising. In this paper, to solve the blurriness issue, we first theoretically analyze the cause of the blurriness issue. Subsequently, an image denoising training framework with WGAN based adversarial learning is proposed. This training framework solves the blurriness issue by guiding the denoising network to find the distribution space of real clean images rather than the distribution space of blurry images and introducing feature information. Experimental results show that this training framework can effectively solve the blurriness issue and achieve better denoising performance than the state-of-the-art denoising methods.

The MSNST feature is used to describe the texture feature of an image and integrated into GrabCut framework to overcome the problem of the scale difference of textured images. In addition, we extend the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to MSNST feature and GMM based on MSNST is constructed to describe the energy function so that the texture feature can be suitably integrated into GrabCut framework and fused with the color feature to achieve the more superior image segmentation performance than the original GrabCut method. For easier implementation and more efficient computation, the symmetric KL divergence is chosen to produce the estimates of the tensor statistics instead of the Riemannian structure of the space of tensor. The Conjugate norm was employed using Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) technique as the distance measure in the color space for more discriminating power. An adaptive fusing strategy is presented to effectively adjust the mixing factor so that the color and MSNST texture features are efficiently integrated to achieve more robust segmentation performance.

Existing machine learning approaches to visual servoing involve system identification of image and kinematic Jacobians. In contrast, the proposed approach actuates a control signal primarily as a function of the error and derivative of the error in the desired visual feature space. This approach leads to a significant reduction in the computational burden as compared to model-based approaches, as well as existing learning approaches to model inverse kinematics. The simplicity of the controller structure will make it attractive in industrial implementations where PD/PID type schemes are in common use. While the initial values of PD gain are learned with the help of model-based controller, an online adaptation scheme has been proposed that is capable of compensating for local uncertainties associated with the system and its environment. Rigorous experiments have been performed to show that visual servoing tasks such as reaching a static target and tracking of a moving target can be achieved using the proposed distributed PD controller. It is shown that the proposed adaptive scheme can dynamically tune the controller parameters during visual servoing, so as to improve its initial performance based on parameters obtained while mimicking the model-based controller.

To provide a robust and lightweight ABR algorithm for mobile streaming, this work improves the robustness of prediction-based scheme against unpredictable network variations and develops RBC (Robust Bitrate Controller) algorithm. Rather than optimizing QoE over the entire buffer capacity, RBC creates buffer margins to absorb the impact of throughput jitters and solves QoE maximization on the narrowed buffer range. The amount of buffer margin is dynamically adjusted based on the real-time throughput fluctuation to ensure sufficient de-jitter space.

The KH algorithm, since inception, has generated considerable real-world application interests in the research community. The standard algorithm solution implementation steps follow the initialization mechanism, which relies mainly on educated guesses or random initialization solution generation. Therefore, to improve the performance of the KH algorithm, the current study is set to investigate the influence of initializing the KH algorithm with three low-discrepancy sequences, such as the Faure sequence, Sobol sequence, and Van der Corput sequence. These low-discrepancy sequences are known to be more uniformly distributed across the problem search space than the commonly used random number initialization method. The study also evaluates the influence of population size on the performance of the proposed variants of the improved KH algorithms. The experimental results show significant improvements for the enhanced KH algorithms in terms of performance and the quality of solutions obtained; particularly on standard benchmarked high-dimension test problem instances, where the enhanced KH variants outperformed the existing basic KH algorithm for all the test functions evaluated. Similarly, the results for low dimension test cases showed less sensitivity to the initialization schemes, as the performance of our proposed improved scheme was comparable to that of the basic KH algorithm. However, in most cases, as the problem dimension was scaled up, the enhanced KH outperformed the basic KH. Evaluation results based on the population size of the algorithm, revealed that when the number of Krill is set at 25, the Sobol based KH initialization scheme performed better than did the other methods. Although, the Van der Corput and Faure based KH initialization schemes showed similar sensitivity when the dimension was set at 20.

Considering dynamic security constraints and wind power uncertainty, this paper presents an insecurity early warning method based on decision tree (DT) and semi-supervised deep learning. First, semi-supervised deep learning is deployed to estimate the dynamic security limit of the critical interface of hybrid AC/DC grids. The system security is assessed by comparing the actual power transfer of the critical interface with the security limit. Then, operating conditions (OCs) are ranked into different insecure levels according to the type of preventive control actions that is needed to ensure the system security. Finally, oblique DT is utilized to identify insecurity classification boundaries in the wind power injection space. Insecure OC sets are constructed based on these classification boundaries. Simulation results of the real-life Jiangsu-Shanghai interconnected grid in east China demonstrate that the proposed method can fast construct the insecure OC sets corresponding to different insecure levels.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399284/,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,Nov. 2021,ieeexplore

Within retrieval workflows for real-time mapping over agricultural regions, such crop-specific information products need to be derived precisely and rapidly. To allow fast processing, intelligent sampling schemes for training databases should be incorporated to establish efficient machine learning (ML) models. In this study, we implemented active learning (AL) heuristics using kernel ridge regression (KRR) to minimize and optimize a training database for variational heteroscedastic Gaussian processes regression (VHGPR) to estimate aboveground N content. Several uncertainty and diversity criteria were applied on a lookup table (LUT) composed of aboveground N content and corresponding hyperspectral reflectance simulated by the PROSAIL-PRO model. The best-performing AL criteria were Euclidian distance-based diversity (EBD) resulting in a reduction of the LUT training data set by 81% (50 initial samples plus 141 samples selected from a pool of 1000 samples). This reduced LUT was used for training VHGPR, which is not only a competitive algorithm but also provides uncertainty estimates. Validation against <i>in situ</i> N reference data provided excellent results with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.84 g/m<sup>2</sup> and a coefficient of determination (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$R^{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) of 0.92.

Participating media has a translucent aspect that comes from light being scattered inside the material. For materials with a small mean-free-path (mfp), multiple scattering effects dominate. Simulating these effects is computationally intensive, as it requires tracking a large number of scattering events inside the material. Existing approaches precompute multiple scattering events inside the material and store the results in a table. During rendering time, this table is used to compute the scattering effects. While these methods are faster than explicit scattering computation, they incur higher storage costs. In this paper, we present a new representation for double and multiple scattering effects that uses a neural network model. The scattering response from all homogeneous participating media is encoded into a neural network in a preprocessing step. At run time, the neural network is then used to predict the double and multiple scattering effects. We demonstrate the effects combined with Virtual Ray Lights (VRL), although our approach can be integrated with other rendering algorithms. Our algorithm is implemented on GPU.

Autonomous systems have a long history in the fields of AI and robotics. However, only through recent advances in technology has it been possible to create autonomous systems capable of operating in long-term, real-world scenarios. Examples include autonomous robots that operate outdoors on land, in air, water, and space; and indoors in offices, care homes, and factories. Designing, developing, and maintaining intelligent autonomous systems that operate in real-world environments over long periods of time, i.e. weeks, months, or years, poses many challenges. This special issue focuses on such challenges and on ways to overcome them using methods from AI. Long-term autonomy can be viewed as both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge of long-term autonomy requires system designers to ensure that an autonomous system can continue operating successfully according to its real-world application demands in unstructured and semi-structured environments. This means addressing issues related to hardware and software robustness (e.g., gluing in screws and profiling for memory leaks), as well as ensuring that all modules and functions of the system can deal with the variation in the environment and tasks that is expected to occur over its operating time.

To alleviate this issue, we propose to exploit the symmetries present in robotic tasks. Intuitively, symmetries from observed trajectories define transformations that leave the space of feasible RL trajectories invariant and can be used to generate new feasible trajectories, which could be used for training. Based on this data augmentation idea, we formulate a general framework, called Invariant Transform Experience Replay that we present with two techniques: (i) Kaleidoscope Experience Replay exploits reflectional symmetries and (ii) Goal-augmented Experience Replay which takes advantage of lax goal definitions. In the Fetch tasks from OpenAI Gym, our experimental results show significant increases in learning rates and success rates. Particularly, we attain a 13, 3, and 5 times speedup in the pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place tasks respectively in the multi-goal setting.

Recent results show that GANs can be used as a fast and efficient emulator for producing novel weak lensing convergence maps as well as cosmic web data in 2D and 3D. However, like any algorithm, the GAN approach comes with a set of limitations, such as an unstable training procedure, inherent randomness of the produced outputs, and difficulties when training the algorithm on multiple data sets. In this work, we employ a number of techniques commonly used in the machine learning literature to address the mentioned limitations. Specifically, we train a GAN to produce weak lensing convergence maps and dark matter overdensity field data for multiple redshifts, cosmological parameters, and modified gravity models. In addition, we train a GAN using the newest Illustris data to emulate dark matter, gas, and internal energy distribution data simultaneously. Finally, we apply the technique of latent space interpolation as a tool for understanding the feature space of the GAN algorithm. We show that the latent space interpolation procedure allows the generation of outputs with intermediate cosmological parameters that were not included in the training data. Our results indicate a 1–20 per cent difference between the power spectra of the GAN-produced and the test data samples depending on the data set used and whether Gaussian smoothing was applied.

One potential solution is to deploy the fog computing servers geographically closer to the vehicles to serve the vehicle-based applications in real time. However, due to the constraint of caching storage space as well as lack of tractable access mode selection and spectrum allocation algorithm, it is very challenging to balance the network transmission performance and fronthaul savings. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization problem of access mode selection and spectrum allocation in fog computing-based vehicular networks. To solve the problem in an efficient way, the original high complexity optimization problem is divided into two subproblems. Wherein, the vehicle access mode selection problem is solved by Q-learning-based algorithm by considering spectrum allocation profiles and the fronthaul link cost. The randomly vehicular network topologies are modeled as CoX processes and the closed-form payoff expressions are derived by the stochastic geometry tools. On the other hand, the optimal spectrum allocation indicator value can be finally obtained via convex optimization.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979163,Joint Learning of Embedding-Based Parent Components and Information Diffusion for Social Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Diffusion on social networks refers to the phenomena that opinions are spread via connected nodes. Given a set of observed cascades, the underlying diffusion process can be inferred for social network analysis. Earlier studies for modeling the diffusion process often assume that the activation of a node depends independently on the activations of its neighbors (or called parent nodes). Nevertheless, the activation of a node also depends on the connectivity of its neighbors. For instance, the opinions from the neighbors of the same closely connected social group are often similar, and thus those neighbors exhibit similar influence. Some recent studies incorporate the structural dependency of neighbors as connected components, which allow more accurate diffusion models to be inferred. However, the effectiveness of such component-based models often depends on how the components are identified. Existing methods are not designed to directly preserve the local connectivity of neighbors. In this paper, we propose to incorporate network embedding to enhance the performance of component-based diffusion models in social networks. In particular, we embed nodes in a social network in a latent vector space with local connectivity of the nodes preserved. Parent component identification then becomes a clustering task in the embedding space. A united probabilistic framework is proposed so that the parent components and the component-based diffusion models can be inferred simultaneously using a two-level EM algorithm based on observed information cascades. For performance evaluation, we apply the proposed model to both synthetic and real world data sets with promising results obtained. The empirical results also show how the use of the embedding-based framework can enhance both the component identification and the diffusion model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9027935/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

The third term refers to region information and measures conformity of the parametric representation of the motion of each region of segmentation to the image spatio-temporal variations. The components of motion in each region of segmentation are represented as functions in a space generated by a set of basis functions. The coefficients of the motion components considered combinations of the basis functions are the parameters of representation. The necessary conditions for a minimum of the functional, which are derived taking into consideration the dependence of the motion parameters on segmentation, lead to an algorithm which condenses to concurrent curve evolution, implemented via level sets, and estimation of the parameters by least squares within each region of segmentation.

Its challenges mainly come from three aspects: 1) a large number of tasks in a workflow cause large-scale decision variables; 2) the two optimization objectives are of quite different scales; 3) and cloud resources are heterogeneous and elastic. So far, many studies focus on adopting multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to solve the cloud workflow scheduling problem without mining the domain knowledge. To make a good trade-off between the makespan and monetary cost, this paper puts forward a knowledge-driven multi-objective evolutionary workflow scheduling algorithm, abbreviated as KMEWSA, including two novel features. On the one hand, the structural knowledge of workflow is mined to simplify the large-scale decision variables into a series of small-scale components, such accelerating the convergence speed of MOEAs. On the other hand, the knowledge on the Pareto front range is mined to estimate the ideal and nadir points for the objective space normalization during the search process, which helps maintain population diversity for MOEAs. At last, based on twenty real-world workflows and parameters of Amazon EC2, extensive experiments are performed to compare the KMEWSA with three baseline algorithms.

The largest challenge of the IM problem is its NP-hardness, and most of the existing approaches are with polynomial time complexity, making themselves unscalable to very large networks. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose LAIM: a linear time iterative approach for efficient IM on large-scale networks. Our framework has two steps: 1) influence approximation and 2) seed set selection. In the first step, we propose an iterative algorithm to compute the local influence of a node based on a recursive formula and use the local influence to approximate its global influence. In the second step, the k influential seed nodes are mined based on the approximated influence in the first step.

The encoder network constructs the discriminative global descriptors to realize high accuracy and robust place recognition, which contributed by extracting the local neighbor geometric features and aggregating neighborhood relationships both in feature space and physical space.

To solve this problem, one way is to recover the label distributions from the logical labels in the training set via leveraging the topological information of the feature space and the correlation among the labels. Such process of recovering label distributions from logical labels is defined as label enhancement (LE), which reinforces the supervision information in the training sets.

The decision function constructed by SVMs is used to determine the most discriminant direction in a neighborhood around the query. Such a direction provides a local feature weighting scheme.

As a practical implementation, we present a first-order LSVB (FoLSVB) algorithm to approximate this distribution over latent variables. From this approximate distribution, one can estimate the model evidence and the posterior over model parameters. The FoLSVB algorithm is directly comparable to the VBEM algorithm and has the same computational complexity.

Existing graph representation learning methods can be classified into two categories: generative models that learn the underlying connectivity distribution in a graph, and discriminative models that predict the probability of edge between a pair of vertices. In this paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning framework unifying the above two classes of methods, in which the generative and the discriminative model play a game-theoretical minimax game. Specifically, for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true connectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces “fake” samples to fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to detect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the generative model. With the competition between these two models, both of them can alternately and iteratively boost their performance. Moreover, we propose a novel graph softmax as the implementation of the generative model to overcome the limitations of traditional softmax function, which can be proven satisfying desirable properties of normalization, graph structure awareness, and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that GraphGAN achieves substantial gains in a variety of applications, including graph reconstruction, link prediction, node classification, recommendation, and visualization, over state-of-the-art baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8941296/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

However, in many cases the collected data may be incomplete or inconsistent, while the underlying environment may be time-varying or unformulated. In this paper, we develop an innovative cognitive fault diagnosis framework that tackles the above challenges. This framework investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of the signal space. Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using a series of signal segments selected with a sliding window. By investigating the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be discriminated from healthy models using a one-class learning algorithm. The framework enables us to construct a fault library when unknown faults occur, which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation. This paper also theoretically investigates how to measure the pairwise distance between two models in the model space and incorporates the model distance into the learning algorithm in the model space. The results on three benchmark applications and one simulated model for the Barcelona water distribution network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6515601/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Jan. 2014,ieeexplore

However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies.

The burgeoning Big Service computing just covers the significant challenges in constructing and maintaining a stable service-oriented SoS. A service-oriented SoS runs under a volatile and uncertain environment. As a step toward big service, service fault tolerance (FT) can guarantee the run-time quality of a service-oriented SoS. To successfully deploy FT in an SoS, online reliability time series prediction, which aims at predicting the reliability in near future for a service-oriented SoS arises as a grand challenge in SoS research. In particular, we need to tackle a number of big data related issues given the large and fast increasing size of the historical data that will be used for prediction purpose.

Given an initial estimate of its position (perhaps based on dead-reckoning) and an image taken of a known environment, our agent first attempts to locate a set of landmarks (real-world objects at known locations), then uses their angular separation to obtain an improved estimate of its current position. Unfortunately, some landmarks may not be visible, or worse, may be confused with other landmarks, resulting in both time wasted in searching for the undetected landmarks, and in further errors in the agent's estimate of its position. To address these problems, we propose a method that uses previous experiences to learn a selection function that, given the set of landmarks that might be visible, returns the subset that can be used to reliably provide an accurate registration of the agent's position.

The vast majority of the real-world networks are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic, containing many different types of nodes and edges and can change drastically over time. The dynamicity and heterogeneity make it extremely challenging to reason about the network structure. Unfortunately, existing approaches are inadequate in modeling real-life dynamical networks as they either have strong assumption of a given stochastic process or fail to capture the heterogeneity of network structure, and they all require extensive computational resources. We introduce <small>Lime</small>, a better approach for modeling dynamic and heterogeneous information networks. <small>Lime</small> is designed to extract high-quality network representation with significantly lower memory resources and computational time over the state-of-the-arts. Unlike prior work that uses a vector to encode each network node, we exploit the semantic relationships among network nodes to encode multiple nodes with similar semantics in shared vectors. By using many fewer node vectors, our approach significantly reduces the required memory space for encoding large-scale networks. To effectively trade information sharing for reduced memory footprint, we employ the recursive neural network (RsNN) with carefully designed optimization strategies to explore the node semantics in a novel cuboid space. We then go further by showing, for the first time, how an effective incremental learning approach can be developed – with the help of RsNN, our cuboid structure, and a set of novel optimization techniques – to allow a learning framework to quickly and efficiently adapt to a constantly evolving network. We evaluate <small>Lime</small> by applying it to three representative network-based tasks, node classification, node clustering and anomaly detection, performing on three large-scale datasets. We compare <small>Lime</small> against eleven prior state-of-the-art approaches for learning network representation.

This theory provides best mean squared finite sample error bounds for some popular statistical learning algorithms and also for several optimal improvements of other existing learning algorithms such as smoothing splines and kernel regularization. The bounds and improved algorithms are not based on asymptotics or Bayesian assumptions and are truly local for each query, not depending on cross validating estimates at other queries to optimize modeling parameters. Results are given for optimal local learning of approximately linear functions with side information (context) using real algebraic geometry. In particular, finite sample error bounds are given for ridge regression and for a local version of lasso regression. The new regression methods require only quadratic programming with linear or quadratic inequality constraints for implementation. Greedy additive expansions are then combined with local minimax learning via a change in metric. An optimal strategy is presented for fusing the local minimax estimators of a class of experts-providing optimal finite sample prediction error bounds from (random) forests. Local minimax learning is extended to kernel machines. Best local prediction error bounds for finite samples are given for Tikhonov regularization. The geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to derive improved estimators with finite sample mean squared error (MSE) bounds for class membership probability in two class pattern classification problems. A purely local, cross validation free algorithm is proposed which uses Fisher information with these bounds to determine best local kernel shape in vector machine learning.

Consequently, many research efforts have been put on location-aware news recommendation, which recommends to users news happening nearest to them. Nevertheless, in a real-world context, users' news preferences are not only related to their locations, but also strongly related to their personal interests. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid method called location-aware personalized news recommendation with explicit semantic analysis (LP-ESA), which recommends news using both the users' personal interests and their geographical contexts. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in LP-ESA suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the performance of LP-ESA. To address these problems, we further propose a novel method called LP-DSA to exploit recommendation-oriented deep neural networks to extract dense, abstract, low dimensional, and effective feature representations for users, news, and locations. Experimental results show that LP-ESA and LP-DSA both significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.

Considering these delay sequences as an uni-dimensional temporal signal, they easily exhibit rich stochastic behavior—abrupt changes of regime and bursts—due to the heterogeneity of the hardware and software components in the data path. There exist approaches for modeling this kind of signals without explicit knowledge of the system components: state-space reconstruction, hidden Markov models, neural networks, etc., but they are mostly focused on the stochasticity of the network only, without taking into account other elements in the sensory flow that also have an important influence in the delays. Previously, we have proposed simpler statistical methods that do not require any component knowledge either and are suitable for more lightweight implementations (e.g., in mobile phone interfaces). In this sense, we report elsewhere a log-normal three-parametrical model that fits reasonably well these delays as long as change detection is completely solved. Now we propose a more flexible solution: the log-logistic distribution, which has been found to fit delays better than the log-normal.

The process for obtaining the coefficients is carried out in three steps. First, an evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is applied, in order to produce an RBF neural network (RBFNN) with a reduced number of RBF transformations and the simplest structure possible. Then, the initial attribute space (or, as commonly known as in logistic regression literature, the covariate space) is transformed by adding the nonlinear transformations of the input variables given by the RBFs of the best individual in the final generation. Finally, a maximum likelihood optimization method determines the coefficients associated with a multilogistic regression model built in this augmented covariate space. In this final step, two different multilogistic regression algorithms are applied: one considers all initial and RBF covariates (multilogistic initial-RBF regression) and the other one incrementally constructs the model and applies cross validation, resulting in an automatic covariate selection [simplelogistic initial-RBF regression (SLIRBF)]. Both methods include a regularization parameter, which has been also optimized. The methodology proposed is tested using 18 benchmark classification problems from well-known machine learning problems and two real agronomical problems. The results are compared with the corresponding multilogistic regression methods applied to the initial covariate space, to the RBFNNs obtained by the EP algorithm, and to other probabilistic classifiers, including different RBFNN design methods [e.g., relaxed variable kernel density estimation, support vector machines, a sparse classifier (sparse multinomial logistic regression)] and a procedure similar to SLIRBF but using product unit basis functions.

Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid.

To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid.

A specific problem that has recently spurred research interest is the so-called Social Circle Inference from Mobility data (SCIM), aiming at inferring relationships among users based on mobility data and without any explicit structured network information. The existing methods either require partial social ties or fail to model the implicit correlations between user links, thereby suffering from critical inference bias. We present a novel SCIM framework, called SCIM via self-Attention and Contextualized-embedding (SCIMAC) - a methodology capturing multiple aspects of users' check-in behavior and complex motion patterns of different users. Instead of directly applying the recurrent model on training user trajectories, the proposed method introduces a new module for context-aware check-in representation learning by adaptively incorporating the internal states of the recurrent layers, which is more effective than the context-independent check-in embedding used in existing social circle inference approaches. To model the underlying correlations between labels, SCIMAC leverages a more sophisticated label embedding technique to adjust the penalties for correlated users, enabling a better understanding of the user's hierarchy in the label space, and alleviating the inference bias.

In this proposed system, control agents are implemented in order to perform temperature set-point delegation for heating and cooling systems in a building, offering a means to observe and learn from both the environment and the occupant. Operation of the proposed algorithms is compared with traditional algorithms utilized for room heating, using a simulated model of a residential building and real data about user behaviour. The results show (i) the performance of machine learning for the occupancy forecasting problem and for the problem of calculating the time to heat or cool a room; and (ii) the performance of the control algorithms, with respect to energy consumption and occupant comfort. The proposed control agents make it possible to significantly improve an occupant comfort with a relatively small increase in energy consumption, compared with simple control strategies that always maintain predefined temperatures. The findings enable the smart grid to anticipate the energy needs of the building.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8131352/,The Computer Journal,June 2015,ieeexplore

Mobile networks begin to establish a separate cluster attributable to the limited communication range of terminals. The multi-beam satellite communication systems can play a significant role in providing direct-to-user satellite mobile services and connecting the separated clusters. This paper focuses on how to efficiently schedule limited satellite-based radio resources to enhance transmission efficiency and meet the requested traffic with low complexity. Taking the inter-beam interference and resource utilization variance into consideration, we build a game-theoretic based model for bandwidth allocation in the forward link. As the size of satellite beams increases, the size of the action space for deep reinforcement learning based on a single agent becomes large, resulting in high time complexity. Thus, we extend the single-agent deep reinforcement learning to the multi-agent context and then propose a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method to achieve the optimal bandwidth allocation strategy. Each beam works as a player who is willing to satisfy the request traffic with flexible payloads. We built a multi-beam satellite platform using real historical data. The experimental results show that this approach is capable of enhancing transmission efficiency and can be flexible to achieve the desired goal with low complexity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9119854/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

How to use these data in the process of prediction is a highly attractive study for many researchers. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we present a novel multivariate time series prediction method based on multi-attention generative adversarial network.

Firstly, the encoder stage consists of two modules, from which the input-attention and self-attention can encode the exogenous sequence into latent space. Secondly, the decoder stage consists of the temporal-convolution-attention module, which can extract long-term temporal patterns. To solve the problem of low accuracy in long-term prediction, inspired by the weight clipping method, we design an improved discrimination network finally. The experiment results indicate that multi-attention mechanism is useful and the discrimination network can improve the performance in multivariate time series prediction.

In the first scenario, we aim at inferring instances' groundtruth given the crowds' annotations. We propose two approaches NAM/RAM (Neighborhood/Relevance Aware Multi-label crowdsourcing) modeling the crowds' expertise and label correlations from different perspectives. Extended from single-label crowdsourcing methods, NAM models the crowds' expertise on individual labels, but based on the idea that for rational workers, their annotations for instances similar in the feature space should also be similar, NAM utilizes information from the feature space and incorporates the local influence of neighborhoods' annotations. Noting that the crowds tend to act in an effort-saving manner while labeling multiple labels, i.e., rather than carefully annotating every proper label, they would prefer scanning and tagging a few most relevant labels, RAM models the crowds' expertise as their ability to distinguish the relevance between label pairs. In the second scenario, we care about cost-efficient crowdsourcing where the labeling and learning process are conducted in tandem. We extend NAM/RAM to the active paradigm and propose instance, label, and worker selection criteria such that the labeling cost is significantly saved compared to passive learning without labeling control.

However, the existing PU learning methods largely overlook the relationship between the examples when handling the unlabeled data, leading to insufficient exploitation of data structure which actually contains useful distribution information. Therefore, by following the multi-manifold assumption which is observed in many real-world vision problems, this paper proposes a novel algorithm termed “Multi-Manifold PU learning” (MMPU), which assumes that the data belonging to different classes lie on different underlying manifolds. As such, the structural information revealed by the dataset is deployed, which is helpful in deciding the labels of unlabeled examples. Our MMPU contains two main steps, namely, multi-manifold exploration and positive confidence training, where the former is accomplished by computing the local similarity, structural similarity, and semantic similarity of pairwise data, and the latter establishes a binary classifier in reproducing kernel Hilbert space based on the real-valued confidence level of each example to be positive. Experimentally, we not only test the proposed MMPU on five highly nonlinear synthetic datasets but also apply MMPU to various typical computer vision tasks, including handwritten digit recognition, violent behavior detection, and hyperspectral image classification. The results demonstrate that MMPU can obtain a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art PU learning methodologies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8662698/,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,May 2020,ieeexplore

The existing algorithms usually focus on the cooperation of different visible views in the original space but neglect the influence of the hidden information among these visible views, or they only consider the hidden information among the views. The algorithms are therefore not efficient since the available information is not fully exploited, particularly the otherness information in different views and the consistency information among them. In practice, the otherness and consistency information in multi-view data are both very useful for effective clustering analyses. In this study, a Multi-View clustering algorithm with the Cooperation of Visible and Hidden views, i.e., MV-Co-VH, is proposed. The MV-Co-VH algorithm first projects the multiple views from different visible spaces to the common hidden space by using non-negative matrix factorization to obtain the common hidden view data. Collaborative learning is then implemented in the clustering procedure based on the visible views and the shared hidden view.

However, it is a challenge to combine multiple heterogeneous features to learn a comprehensive description of data samples. To solve this problem, many methods explore the correlation between various features across views by assuming that all views share the same semantic information. Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a new multi-view robust feature learning (MRFL) method. In addition to projecting features from different views to a shared semantic subspace, our approach also learns the irrelevant information of data space to capture the feature dependencies between views in potential common subspaces. Therefore, the MRFL can obtain flexible feature associations hidden in multi-view data. A new objective function is designed to derive, and solve the effective optimization process of MRFL.

The important features are identified using the orthogonal arrays and the signal-to-noise ratio, and are then used to construct a reduced model measurement scale. The contribution of each important feature to classification is also derived according to the effect gain to develop a weighted Mahalanobis distance which is finally used as the distance metric for the classification of MMTS. Using the reduced model measurement scale, an unknown example will be classified into the class with minimum weighted Mahalanobis distance considering only the important features. For evaluating the effectiveness of MMTS, a numerical experiment is implemented, and the results show that MMTS outperforms other well-known algorithms not only on classification accuracy but also on feature selection efficiency.

Additional fuzzy agents are employed to fuse the recommendations of the local agents. Real-time implementation without special hardware is possible by using singleton output values during fuzzy rule evaluation.

A neural network is utilized to learn the skin and nonskin colors. The skin-color probability map is utilized for skin classification and morphology-based preprocessing. Heuristic rule is used for face-ratio analysis and Bayesian cost analysis for label classification. A face-detection module, based on a 2D color model in the and YUV color space, is selected over the traditional skin-color model in a 3D color space.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046604,Multiple Kernel Learning With Minority Oversampling for Classifying Imbalanced Data,IEEE,Journals,"Class imbalance problems, developed due to the sampling bias or measurement error, occur frequently in real-world pattern classification tasks. The traditional classifiers focus on the overall classification accuracy and ignore the minority class, which may degrade the classification performance. However, existing oversampling algorithms generally make specific assumptions to balance the class size and do not sufficiently consider irregularities present in imbalanced data. As a result, these methods can perform well only on certain benchmarks. In this paper, by incorporating minority oversampling and cost-sensitive learning, we propose multiple kernel learning with minority oversampling (MKLMO), for efficiently handling the class imbalance problem with small disjuncts, overlapping, and nonlinear shape. Unlike existing methods where oversampling of the minority class is performed first and then a standard classifier is deployed on the rebalanced data, the proposed MKLMO generates synthetic instances and trains classifier synchronously in the same feature space. Specially, we define a distance metric in the optimal feature space by multiple kernel learning and use kernel trick to expand the original Gram matrix. Moreover, we assign different weights to instances, based on the imbalance ratio, for reducing the bias of the classifier towards the majority class. In order to evaluate the proposed MKLMO method, several experiments are performed with nine artificial and twenty-one real-world datasets.

Nevertheless, existing GCNs have two limitations. First, most GCNs are constructed on unweighted graphs, considering importance of neighbors as the same, which is not in line with reality. Second, the receptive field of GCNs is fixed, which limits the effectiveness of GCNs for feature representation.

By replicating video content closer to the network edge, caching provides an effective mechanism for alleviating the demand for massive bandwidth for the Internet backbone. It reduces the network traffic and capital expense for streaming the video content, and in the meantime, enhance Internet's Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a neural adaptive caching approach, named NA-Caching, for helping cache learn to make caching decisions from its own experiences rather than a specific mathematical model, in a way similar to how a human being learns a new skill (e.g. cycling, swimming). NA-Caching leverages the benefits of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as well as the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to maximize the cache efficiency by jointly learning request features, caching space dynamics and making decisions.

A run of HC requires multiple iterations, each of which needs to compute and update the pairwise distances between all intermediate clusters. This makes the exact algorithm for HC inevitably suffer from quadratic time and space complexities. To address large-scale data, various approximate/parallel algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of HC. However, such algorithms still rely on conventional linkage methods (such as single, centroid, average, complete, or Ward's) for defining pairwise distances, mostly focusing on the approximation/parallelization of linkage computations. Given that the choice of linkage profoundly affects not only the quality but also the efficiency of HC, we propose a new linkage method named NC-link and design an exact algorithm for NC-link-based HC. To guarantee the exactness, the proposed algorithm maintains the quadratic nature in time complexity but exhibits only linear space complexity, thereby allowing us to address million-object data on a personal computer. To underpin the extensibility of our approach, we showthat the algorithmic nature of NC-link enables single instruction multiple data (SIMD) parallelization and subquadratic-time approximation of HC. To verify our proposal, we thoroughly tested it with a number of large-scale real and synthetic data sets. In terms of efficiency, NC-link allowed us to perform HC substantially more space efficiently or faster than conventional methods: compared with average and complete linkages, using NC-link incurred only 0.7%-1.75% of the memory usage, and the NC-link-based implementation delivered speedups of approximately 3.5 times over the centroid and Ward's linkages. With regard to clustering quality, the proposed method was able to retrieve hierarchical structures from input data as faithfully as in the popular average and centroid linkage methods.

It is assumed that the unknown dynamics can be estimated using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy model with arbitrary precision. The successful implementation of a PI scheme depends on the effective learning of critic network parameters. Network parameters must stabilize the system in each iteration in addition to approximating the critic and the cost. It is found that the critic updates according to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman formulation sometimes lead to the instability of the closed-loop systems. In the proposed work, a novel critic network parameter update scheme is adopted, which not only approximates the critic at current iteration but also provides feasible solutions that keep the policy stable in the next step of training by combining a Lyapunov-based linear matrix inequalities approach with PI. The critic modeling technique presented here is the first of its kind to address this issue. Though multiple literature exists discussing the convergence of PI, however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no literature, which focuses on the effect of critic network parameters on the convergence. Computational complexity in the proposed algorithm is reduced to the order of (F<sub>z</sub>)<sup>n-1</sup>, where n is the fuzzy state dimensionality and F<sub>z</sub> is the number of fuzzy zones in the states space.

Here we describe a novel algorithm, locally linear inlaying (LLI), which combines simple geometric intuitions and rigorously established optimality to compute the global embedding of a nonlinear manifold. Using a divide-and-conquer strategy, LLI gains some advantages in itself. First, its time complexity is linear in the number of data points, and hence LLI can be implemented efficiently. Second, LLI overcomes problems caused by the nonuniform sample distribution. Third, unlike existing algorithms such as isometric feature mapping (Isomap), local tangent space alignment (LTSA), and locally linear coordination (LLC), LLI is robust to noise. In addition, to evaluate the embedding results quantitatively, two criteria based on information theory and Kolmogorov complexity theory, respectively, are proposed. Furthermore, we demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal by synthetic and real-world data sets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4749257/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,Feb. 2009,ieeexplore
10.1109/TPAMI.2020.2965531,Novelty Detection and Online Learning for Chunk Data Streams,IEEE,Journals,"Datastream analysis aims at extracting discriminative information for classification from continuously incoming samples. It is extremely challenging to detect novel data while incrementally updating the model efficiently and stably, especially for high-dimensional and/or large-scale data streams. This paper proposes an efficient framework for novelty detection and incremental learning for unlabeled chunk data streams. First, an accurate factorization-free kernel discriminative analysis (FKDA-X) is put forward through solving a linear system in the kernel space. FKDA-X produces a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), in which unlabeled chunk data can be detected and classified by multiple known-classes in a single decision model with a deterministic classification boundary. Moreover, based on FKDA-X, two optimal methods FKDA-CX and FKDA-C are proposed. FKDA-CX uses the micro-cluster centers of original data as the input to achieve excellent performance in novelty detection. FKDA-C and incremental FKDA-C (IFKDA-C) using the class centers of original data as their input have extremely fast speed in online learning. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation on under-sampled and large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms make it possible to learn unlabeled chunk data streams with significantly lower computational costs and comparable accuracies than the state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8955936/,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,1 July 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIP.2020.3025437,On Aggregation of Unsupervised Deep Binary Descriptor With Weak Bits,IEEE,Journals,"Despite the thrilling success achieved by existing binary descriptors, most of them are still in the mire of three limitations: 1) vulnerable to the geometric transformations; 2) incapable of preserving the manifold structure when learning binary codes; 3) NO guarantee to find the true match if multiple candidates happen to have the same Hamming distance to a given query. All these together make the binary descriptor less effective, given large-scale visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based feature descriptor, namely Unsupervised Deep Binary Descriptor (UDBD), which learns transformation invariant binary descriptors via projecting the original data and their transformed sets into a joint binary space. Moreover, we involve a ℓ<sub>2,1</sub>-norm loss term in the binary embedding process to gain simultaneously the robustness against data noises and less probability of mistakenly flipping bits of the binary descriptor, on top of it, a graph constraint is used to preserve the original manifold structure in the binary space. Furthermore, a weak bit mechanism is adopted to find the real match from candidates sharing the same minimum Hamming distance, thus enhancing matching performance.

The approaches proposed so far to FDT learning, however, have generally neglected time and space requirements. In this paper, we propose a distributed FDT learning scheme shaped according to the MapReduce programming model for generating both binary and multiway FDTs from big data. The scheme relies on a novel distributed fuzzy discretizer that generates a strong fuzzy partition for each continuous attribute based on fuzzy information entropy. The fuzzy partitions are, therefore, used as an input to the FDT learning algorithm, which employs fuzzy information gain for selecting the attributes at the decision nodes. We have implemented the FDT learning scheme on the Apache Spark framework. We have used ten real-world publicly available big datasets for evaluating the behavior of the scheme along three dimensions: 1) performance in terms of classification accuracy, model complexity, and execution time; 2) scalability varying the number of computing units; and 3) ability to efficiently accommodate an increasing dataset size. We have demonstrated that the proposed scheme turns out to be suitable for managing big datasets even with a modest commodity hardware support. Finally, we have used the distributed decision tree learning algorithm implemented in the MLLib library and the Chi-FRBCS-BigData algorithm, a MapReduce distributed fuzzy rule-based classification system, for comparative analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7803561/,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,Feb. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1093/mnras/stx687,On the realistic validation of photometric redshifts,OUP,Journals,"Two of the main problems encountered in the development and accurate validation of photometric redshift (photo-z) techniques are the lack of spectroscopic coverage in the feature space (e.g. colours and magnitudes) and the mismatch between the photometric error distributions associated with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. Although these issues are well known, there is currently no standard benchmark allowing a quantitative analysis of their impact on the final photo-z estimation. In this work, we present two galaxy catalogues, Teddy and Happy, built to enable a more demanding and realistic test of photo-z methods. Using photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and spectroscopy from a collection of sources, we constructed data sets that mimic the biases between the underlying probability distribution of the real spectroscopic and photometric sample. We demonstrate the potential of these catalogues by submitting them to the scrutiny of different photo-z methods, including machine learning (ML) and template fitting approaches. Beyond the expected bad results from most ML algorithms for cases with missing coverage in the feature space, we were able to recognize the superiority of global models in the same situation and the general failure across all types of methods when incomplete coverage is convoluted with the presence of photometric errors – a data situation which photo-z methods were not trained to deal with up to now and which must be addressed by future large-scale surveys.

The UAV can charge the sensing devices remotely and harvest their data. A key challenge is online MPT and data collection in the presence of on-board control of a UAV (e.g., patrolling velocity) for preventing battery drainage and data queue overflow of the devices, while up-to-date knowledge on battery level and data queue of the devices is not available at the UAV. In this paper, an on-board deep Q-network is developed to minimize the overall data packet loss of the sensing devices, by optimally deciding the device to be charged and interrogated for data collection, and the instantaneous patrolling velocity of the UAV. Specifically, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the states of battery level and data queue length of devices, channel conditions, and waypoints given the trajectory of the UAV; and solve it optimally with Q-learning. Furthermore, we propose the on-board deep Q-network that enlarges the state space of the MDP, and a deep reinforcement learning based scheduling algorithm that asymptotically derives the optimal solution online, even when the UAV has only outdated knowledge on the MDP states.

However, the improved quality comes at a higher computational cost, as these approaches, even though heuristic driven, involve optimization over multidimensional real continuous space. The number of possible search trees in ML is at least exponential, thereby making runtimes on even modest-sized datasets to clock up to several million CPU hours. Evaluation of these trees, involving node-level likelihood vector computation and branch-length optimization, can be partitioned into tasks (or kernels), providing the application with the potential to benefit from hardware acceleration. The range of hardware acceleration architectures tried so far offer limited degree of fine-grain parallelism. Network-on-chip (NoC) is an emerging paradigm that can efficiently support integration of massive number of cores on a chip. In this paper, we explore the design and performance evaluation of 2-D and 3-D NoC architectures for RAxML, which is one of the most widely used ML software suites. Specifically, we implement the computation kernels of the top three functions consuming more than 85% of the total software runtime. Simulations show that through appropriate choice of NoC architecture, and novel core design, allocation and placement strategies, our NoC-based implementation can achieve individual function-level speedups of 390x to 847x, speed up the targeted kernels in excess of 6500x, and provide end-to-end runtime reductions up to 5x over state-of-the-art multithreaded software.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6218233/,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,July 2012,ieeexplore

In this study, we propose a new online method, which is a density grid-based method for data stream clustering. The primary objectives of the density grid-based method are to reduce the number of distant function calls and to improve the cluster quality. The method is conducted entirely online and consists of two main phases. The first phase generates the Core Micro-Clusters (CMCs), and the second phase combines the CMCs into macro clusters. The grid-based method was utilized as an outlier buffer in order to handle multi-density data and noises.

Their advantage is being suitable for the online interaction detection, recognition, and also for fusing information from multiple cameras, while enabling a fast implementation based on online recursive updates. For recognition, in order to compare interaction trajectories in the space of KSS models, we design so-called pairwise kernels with a special symmetry. For detection, we exploit the geometry of linear operators in Hilbert space, and extend to KSS models the concept of parity space, originally defined for linear models. For fusion, we combine KSS models with kernel construction and multiview learning techniques. We extensively evaluate the approach on four single view publicly available data sets, and we also introduce, and will make public, a new challenging human interactions data set that we have collected using a network of three cameras.

The key contribution is a computational complexity reduction compared to a similar approach with globally supported basis functions.

The approximation works well when the system dynamics exhibit limited correlation between points well separated in the state-space domain.

Therefore, the efficiency of condition monitoring can benefit from the compactness of the machine condition hash, while comparable diagnostic and prognostic results can still be achieved. The effectiveness of the developed method is verified with two benchmark bearing datasets. Considerations on practical condition monitoring applications are also presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8832158/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/TGRS.2020.3045790,Physically Constrained Transfer Learning Through Shared Abundance Space for Hyperspectral Image Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is one of the most active research topics and has achieved promising results boosted by the recent development of deep learning. However, most state-of-the-art approaches tend to perform poorly when the training and testing images are on different domains, e.g., the source domain and target domain, respectively, due to the spectral variability caused by different acquisition conditions. Transfer learning-based methods address this problem by pretraining in the source domain and fine-tuning on the target domain. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of data on the target domain has to be labeled and nonnegligible computational resources are required to retrain the whole network. In this article, we propose a new transfer learning scheme to bridge the gap between the source and target domains by projecting the HSI data from the source and target domains into a shared abundance space based on their own physical characteristics. In this way, the domain discrepancy would be largely reduced such that the model trained on the source domain could be applied to the target domain without extra efforts for data labeling or network retraining. The proposed method is referred to as physically constrained transfer learning through shared abundance space (PCTL-SAS). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as compared to the state of the art. The success of this endeavor would largely facilitate the deployment of HSI classification for real-world sensing scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9318553/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

Monitoring their safety and automatically identifying and locating third-party damage events are crucial to energy supply. However, most traditional methods lack in-depth consideration of distributed fiber signals and have not been tested on real-world long-distance pipelines, making it difficult to deploy them in operating long-distance pipelines. In this study, we utilize a novel real-time machine-learning method based on phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer technology to monitor the safety of oil and gas pipelines. Specifically, we build a multifeature-fusion convolutional neural network and LightGBM fusion model based on two novel complementary spatiotemporal features. The method was applied to a large amount of data collected from real-world oil–gas transportation pipelines of the China National Petroleum Corporation. The proposed method could accurately locate and identify third-party damage events in real-time under conditions of strong noise and various types of system hardware, and could effectively handle signal drift in the time and space dimensions.

Automatic separation of layers from color/contrast or from stereo alone is known to be error-prone. Here, color, contrast, and stereo matching information are fused to infer layers accurately and efficiently. The first algorithm, layered dynamic programming (LDP), solves stereo in an extended six-state space that represents both foreground/background layers and occluded regions. The stereo-match likelihood is then fused with a contrast-sensitive color model that is learned on-the-fly and stereo disparities are obtained by dynamic programming. The second algorithm, layered graph cut (LGC), does not directly solve stereo. Instead, the stereo match likelihood is marginalized over disparities to evaluate foreground and background hypotheses and then fused with a contrast-sensitive color model like the one used in LDP. Segmentation is solved efficiently by ternary graph cut. Both algorithms are evaluated with respect to ground truth data and found to have similar performance, substantially better than either stereo or color/contrast alone. However, their characteristics with respect to computational efficiency are rather different.

In addition, the cycle mechanism is introduced to reinforce features gradually, which also lighten model complexity by adopting time update instead of space stack. Visualization maps prove the feasibility of RCCM, and the discussion of cascade layers shows the extension of our proposed algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of RCCM, we have conducted extensive experiments on some benchmark image datasets, and the results show that RCCM is significantly better than several state-of-the-art algorithms.

Although most existing methods consider heterogeneous relations and achieve promising performance, they usually employ one single model for all relations without distinction, which inevitably restricts the capability of HIN embedding. In this paper, we argue that heterogeneous relations have different structural characteristics, and propose a novel Relation structure-aware HIN Embedding model, called RHINE. By exploring four real-world networks with thorough analysis, we present two structure-related measures which consistently distinguish heterogeneous relations into two categories: Affiliation Relations (ARs) and Interaction Relations (IRs). To respect the distinctive structural characteristics of relations, in RHINE, we propose different models specifically tailored to handle ARs and IRs, which can better capture the structures in HINs. Finally, we combine and optimize these models in a unified manner. Furthermore, considering that nodes connected via heterogeneous relations may have multi-aspect semantics and each relation focuses on one aspect, we introduce relation-specific projection matrices to learn node and relation embeddings in separate spaces rather than a common space, which can better preserve the semantics in HINs, referring to a new model RHINE-M.

The main idea behind the approach is to consider the robot arena as an excitable medium, in which moving objects-obstacles and the target-are represented by sites of autowave generation: the target generates attractive waves, while the obstacles repulsive ones. The moving robot detects traveling and colliding wave fronts and uses the information about dynamics of the autowaves to adapt its direction of collision-free motion toward the target. This approach allows us to achieve a highly adaptive robot behavior and thus an optimal path along which the robot reaches the target while avoiding obstacles. At the computational and experimental levels, we adopt principles of computation in reaction-diffusion (RD) nonlinear active media. Nonlinear media where autowaves are used for information processing purposes can therefore be considered as RD computing devices. In this paper, we design and experiment with three types of RD processors: experimental and computational Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical processor, computational CNN processor, and experimental RD-CNN very large-scale integration chip-the complex analog and logic computing engine (CACE1k).

The most complicated computation in each recursion is inversion of the augmented information matrix. Through data augmentation, this matrix is diagonal and easy to invert. More importantly, there is no search in such recursive procedures. Consequently, the computational time is much less than that associated with existing numerical methods for finding ML estimates.

One of the beneficiaries is an adaptive traffic control system that responds to real-time traffic observations by governing the signal phase and timings. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is extensively utilized in the literature in order to decrease traffic congestion in a road network. However, most of the previous works leverage centralized and cloud-based RL due to the computational complexity of underlying deep neural networks (DNN). Therefore, a persistent challenge towards adopting Edge learning is in devising a Multi-Agent RL in which agents are simplified, and their state spaces are localized but they perform comparable to the centralized RL. This article presents a Collaborative and Adaptive Signaling on the Edge (CASE), a novel Multi-Agent RL approach to control the traffic signals' phase and timing. Each signalized intersection in the road network is provided with an Edge Learning Platform which hosts an RL-Agent that observes local traffic states and learns an optimum signal policy. Moreover, CASE allows collaboration among RL-Agents by sharing their signal phase and timings to achieve convergence and performance. This collaboration is limited to one's direct neighbours only to minimize the computational complexity. We performed rigorous evaluations in terms of the choice of RL methods and their state space/reward and found that our collaborative state-space has resulted in a performance comparable to a centralized RL yet with a cost similar to the decentralized RL.

These data have to be filtered and their cardinality reduced to come up with a mesh manageable at interactive rates. We introduce here a novel procedure to accomplish these two tasks, which is based on an optimized version of soft vector quantization (VQ). The resulting technique has been termed enhanced vector quantization (EVQ) since it introduces several improvements with respect to the classical soft VQ approaches. These are based on computationally expensive iterative optimization; local computation is introduced here, by means of an adequate partitioning of the data space called hyperbox (HB), to reduce the computational time so as to be linear in the number of data points N, saving more than 80% of time in real applications. Moreover, the algorithm can be fully parallelized, thus leading to an implementation that is sublinear in N. The voxel side and the other parameters are automatically determined from data distribution on the basis of the Zador's criterion. This makes the algorithm completely automatic. Because the only parameter to be specified is the compression rate, the procedure is suitable even for nontrained users. Results obtained in reconstructing faces of both humans and puppets as well as artifacts from point clouds publicly available on the web are reported and discussed, in comparison with other methods available in the literature. EVQ has been conceived as a general procedure, suited for VQ applications with large data sets whose data space has relatively low dimensionality",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4049818/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,Jan. 2007,ieeexplore
10.1109/TSE.2020.2979701,Reinforcement-Learning-Guided Source Code Summarization Using Hierarchical Attention,IEEE,Journals,"Code summarization (aka comment generation) provides a high-level natural language description of the function performed by code, which can benefit the software maintenance, code categorization and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework which encodes source code into a hidden space and later decodes it into a natural language space. Such approaches suffer from the following drawbacks: (a) they are mainly input by representing code as a sequence of tokens while ignoring code hierarchy; (b) most of the encoders only input simple features (e.g., tokens) while ignoring the features that can help capture the correlations between comments and code; (c) the decoders are typically trained to predict subsequent words by maximizing the likelihood of subsequent ground truth words, while in real world, they are excepted to generate the entire word sequence from scratch. As a result, such drawbacks lead to inferior and inconsistent comment generation accuracy. To address the above limitations, this paper presents a new code summarization approach using hierarchical attention network by incorporating multiple code features, including type-augmented abstract syntax trees and program control flows. Such features, along with plain code sequences, are injected into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework (e.g., actor-critic network) for comment generation. Our approach assigns weights (pays “attention”) to tokens and statements when constructing the code representation to reflect the hierarchical code structure under different contexts regarding code features (e.g., control flows and abstract syntax trees). Our reinforcement learning mechanism further strengthens the prediction results through the actor network and the critic network, where the actor network provides the confidence of predicting subsequent words based on the current state, and the critic network computes the reward values of all the possible extensions of the current state to provide global guidance for explorations. Eventually, we employ an advantage reward to train both networks and conduct a set of experiments on a real-world dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baselines by around 22 to 45 percent in BLEU-1 and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by around 5 to 60 percent in terms of S-BLEU and C-BLEU.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031440/,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore

Reservoir computing (RC) provides efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of the MTS that can be further processed by standard classifiers.

In this article, we introduce the reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on RC to learn vectorial representations of MTS. Each MTS is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared with other RC methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance due to an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second contribution, we propose a modular RC framework for MTS classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced RC architectures. The architectures are compared with other MTS classifiers, including deep learning models and time series kernels.

Diverse kinds of trajectories from the sensor networks provide an unprecedented opportunity for intelligence analysis. The geographic co-movement pattern has rarely been used by the police force to infer social connections, although it has been prevalent in other fields. The previous studies have mainly focused on a singular form of trajectories with exact co-locations, and the spread of the co-locations is over-looked.

Firstly, We constructed the foundation for the discovery of co-occurrence events, namely space-time resonance honeycomb. It consists of multiple polygonal zones over sensor networks. Secondly, we transform all trajectories into a series of space-time prisms, and co-location activities are recorded using a sliding window approach.

Subsequently, the candidate poses are further verified and refined by matching the relative gradient images through an iterative energy-minimization procedure.

However, in the SDN-enabled switches, available TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) resources for traffic measurement are limited. Thus, it is necessary to utilize traffic matrix (TM) estimation to derive a hybrid network monitoring scheme through combining the partial direct measurement offered by SDN with some inference techniques. Although large size flows play an important role in improving TM estimation accuracy, directly monitoring each flow and finding out large size flows consume massive channel bandwidth resource between control plane and data plane. Therefore, in this paper, we identify large size flows from multiple historical TMs instead of monitoring each flow. First, we analyze multiple historical TMs and observe that origin-to-destination (OD) pair whose flow size is selected as large size flow at last time slot is most likely to be selected for per-flow monitoring at next time slot, so these OD pairs are identified by gradient boosting machine and are directly regarded as sampled OD pairs in order to reduce resource consumption. Then, we propose a greedy heuristic algorithm to solve SDN-enabled switch selection problem to best utilize the TCAM resources and guarantee that most of sampled OD pairs are measured in the flow table. We also present a source node prefix tree based bit merging aggregation (SPTBMA) scheme to design feasible forwarding rules to be inserted in TCAM of SDN-enabled switches and reserve more TCAM space for sampled OD pairs.

Previous examinations of STBC identification were focused on single-user transmissions over single-carrier and multi-carrier systems in combination with uncoded broadcasts. Practical systems, on the other hand, contain many users and employ error-correcting codes. For the first time in literature, this work explores the problem of STBC identification for multi-user uplink transmissions in single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems.

Lightweight JavaScript engines use several techniques for memory optimization, such as static heap reservation and compressed addressing. Recent IoT systems also use several external libraries and a larger on-chip memory to support abundant functionalities, such as machine learning and connectivity. However, as the JavaScript heap space is not resizable owing to the memory optimizations, the JavaScript engine or an external library is prone to fail the memory allocation in these devices. To address this problem, we propose a flexible memory optimization technique, segment-based multiple-base compressed addressing (SMBCA), which compresses a pointer indicating a JavaScript object allocated to a resizable heap based on multiple base addresses. SMBCA comprises two components: a dynamic segment allocator (DSA) and a multiple-base compressed address translator (MBCAT). DSA dynamically allocates the JavaScript heap in segment units. Meanwhile, MBCAT converts a low-bitwidth address into a full-bitwidth address and vice versa, based on the multiple base addresses. To reduce the address compression overhead of MBCAT, we propose a software cache technique, reverse map cache (RMC). We found that the SMBCA reduces average memory usage by 43.9% compared to the existing lightweight JavaScript engines when running SunSpider benchmarks, V8 benchmarks, and real-world applications.

When facing dramatic growth in new pedestrian videos, existing video-based person re-id methods usually need large quantities of labeled pedestrian videos to train a discriminative model. In practice, labeling large quantities of pedestrian videos is a costly and time-consuming task, which will limit the application of these methods in the real environment. Therefore, it is valuable and necessary to investigate how to learn a discriminative re-id model by using limited labeled training pedestrian videos. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised cross-view projection-based dictionary learning (SCPDL) approach for video-based person re-id. Specifically, SCPDL jointly learns a pair of feature projection matrices and a pair of dictionaries by integrating the information contained in labeled and unlabeled pedestrian videos. With the learned feature projection matrices, the influence of variations within each video to the re-id can be reduced. With the learned dictionary pair, pedestrian videos from two different cameras can be converted into coding coefficients in a common representation space, such that the differences between different cameras can be bridged. In the learning process, the labeled pedestrian videos are used to ensure that the learned dictionaries have favorable discriminability; the large quantities of unlabeled pedestrian videos are used to ensure that SCPDL can better capture the variations between pedestrian videos, such that the learned dictionaries can own stronger representative capability.

Specifically, a novel similarity measurement strategy of log-likelihood space is designed to calculate the log-likelihood value of the multivariate time series in sliding time windows, which can effectively help the hidden Markov model (HMM) to capture the dynamic temporal characteristics from multiple historical sequences in similar patterns, so that the prediction accuracy is greatly improved. In order to improve the generalization ability and stability of a single HMM, we further adopt the framework of Bagging ensemble learning algorithm to reduce the prediction errors of a single model. The experimental study is implemented on a real dataset from a company in Hunan Province, China. We test the model in different forecasting periods. The results of multiple experiments and comparison with several state-of-the-art models show that the proposed approach has higher prediction accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9183956/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

If one method outperforms another in simulation, how likely is that trend to hold in reality on a robot? We examine this question for embodied PointGoal navigation - developing engineering tools and a research paradigm for evaluating a simulator by its sim2real predictivity. First, we develop Habitat-PyRobot Bridge (HaPy), a library for seamless execution of identical code on simulated agents and robots - transferring simulation-trained agents to a LoCoBot platform with a one-line code change. Second, we investigate the sim2real predictivity of Habitat-Sim M. Savva et al., for PointGoal navigation. We 3D-scan a physical lab space to create a virtualized replica, and run parallel tests of 9 different models in reality and simulation. We present a new metric called Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) to quantify predictivity. We find that SRCC for Habitat as used for the CVPR19 challenge is low (0.18 for the success metric), suggesting that performance differences in this simulator-based challenge do not persist after physical deployment. This gap is largely due to AI agents learning to exploit simulator imperfections - abusing collision dynamics to `slide' along walls, leading to shortcuts through otherwise non-navigable space. Naturally, such exploits do not work in the real world. Our experiments show that it is possible to tune simulation parameters to improve sim2real predictivity (e.g. improving SRCC<sub>Succ</sub> from 0.18 to 0.844) - increasing confidence that in-simulation comparisons will translate to deployed systems in reality.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9158349/,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

Our contributions are mainly in three areas. 1) A novel feature selection criterion is proposed, which is based on the psychological similarity between the positive and negative training sets. 2) An effective online feature selection algorithm is implemented in a boosting manner to select the most representative features for the current query concept and combine classifiers constructed over the selected features to retrieve images. 3) To apply the proposed feature selection method in region-based image retrieval systems, we propose a novel region-based representation to describe images in a uniform feature space with real-valued fuzzy features. Our system is suitable for online relevance feedback learning in CBIR by meeting the three requirements: learning with small size training set, the intrinsic asymmetry property of training samples, and the fast response requirement.

The new approach has been applied to the identification in real time of various objects present in the Joint European Torus videos of both infrared (IR) and visible cameras. IR videos are here used to detect hot spots and the regions of the walls in which dangerously high temperatures are reached, whereas visible cameras provide information about multifaceted asymmetric radiations from the edge, which are dangerous instabilities that can lead to disruptions. Their identification is particularly difficult because of their movement and their shape which is similar to other objects present in the frames.

To effectively learn on a predefined graph with both labeled data and unlabeled data, the graph convolutional network (GCN) was proposed and has attracted a lot of attention due to its high-performance graph-based feature extraction along with its low computational complexity. Nevertheless, the performance of GCNs is highly sensitive to the quality of the graph, meaning with high probability, the GCNs will achieve poor performances on a badly defined graphs. In numerous real-world semisupervised learning problems, the graph connecting each entity in the data space implicitly exists so that there is no naturally predefined graph in these problems. To overcome the issues, in this article, we apply unified GR techniques and GCNs in a framework that can be implemented in semisupervised learning problems. To achieve this framework, we propose sparsity-induced graph convolutional network (SIGCN) for semisupervised learning.

However, devices like cameras and drones may have limited computational capability and storage space so that the direct deployment of complex deep saliency models becomes infeasible. To address this problem, this paper proposes a dynamic saliency estimation approach for aerial videos via spatiotemporal knowledge distillation. In this approach, five components are involved, including two teachers, two students and the desired spatiotemporal model. The knowledge of spatial and temporal saliency is first separately transferred from the two complex and redundant teachers to their simple and compact students, while the input scenes are also degraded from high-resolution to low-resolution to remove the probable data redundancy so as to greatly speed up the feature extraction process. After that, the desired spatiotemporal model is further trained by distilling and encoding the spatial and temporal saliency knowledge of two students into a unified network. In this manner, the inter-model redundancy can be removed for the effective estimation of dynamic saliency on aerial videos. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is comparable to 11 state-of-the-art models in estimating visual saliency on aerial videos, while its speed reaches up to 28,738 FPS and 1,490.5 FPS on the GPU and CPU platforms, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8868103/,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2020,ieeexplore

Compared with other biometric-based methods, it can provide higher security performance. The difficulty of the problem lies in how to stably extract ECG signal features and achieve real-time verification. In this study, a new type of sparse representation learning framework called statistical <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-best adaptive Fourier decomposition (SAFD) originated by Qian is adopted in ECG biometric identification. Adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) is a recently developed combination of transform-based signal decomposition and sparse representation method, which can adaptively select the atoms from a redundant dictionary through orthogonal processing. The advantage of the AFD-type methods is that each atom in the dictionary has a precise mathematical formula with good analytic properties. This characteristic is significantly distinguished it from other existing sparse representations, where the atoms learned are usually matrix data and cannot be described mathematically. The proposed SAFD extends the existing <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-best AFD from processing single signal to multi-signals and implements the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-best AFD in the stochastic Hardy space. Therefore, the small number of learned atoms by SAFD is sufficient to capture internal structure and robustness of the signal and generate a discriminative representation that reflects the time–frequency characteristics of signals. It is very suitable for non-stationary signals like ECG. The proof of convergence of the algorithm is presented. Extensive experiments are conducted on five public databases collected in different realistic conditions, and an average identification accuracy of 98.0% is achieved. In addition, less than 1 ms for one matching process makes it possible to be implemented in real time.

10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3111740,Structure-Aware Multikernel Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Recently, the inclusion of spatial information has drawn increasing attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) applications due to its effectiveness in terms of improving classification accuracy. However, most of the techniques that include such spatial knowledge in the analysis are based on spatial–spectral weak assumptions, i.e., all pixels in a spatial region are assumed to belong to the same class, and close pixels in spectral space are assigned the same label. This article proposes a novel structure-aware multikernel learning (SaMKL) method for HSI classification, which takes into account structural issues in order to effectively overcome the aforementioned weak assumptions and introduce a true multikernel learning process (based on multiple features derived from the original HSI), thus improving the spectral separability of such features. The proposed SaMKL method is composed of the following main steps. First, multiple (i.e., spectral, spatial, and textural) features are extracted from the original HSI based on various filtering operators. Then, a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-peak density approach is designed to define superpixel regions that can properly capture the structural information of HSIs and overcome the aforementioned weak assumptions. Next, three sets of composite kernels are separately constructed to make full use of the spectral, spatial, and textural information. Meanwhile, these three sets of composite kernels are independently incorporated into a support vector machine classifier to obtain their corresponding classification results. Finally, majority voting is used as a simple and effective method to obtain the final classification labels. Experimental results on real HSI datasets indicate that the SaMKL outperforms other well-known and state-of-the-art classification approaches, in particular, when very limited labeled samples are available <i>a priori</i>.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9535266/,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2021,ieeexplore

In domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers (i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap from the split classifiers.

To jointly characterize the invocation process, the path features and end-cross features are captured respectively through an explicit path modeling layer and an implicit cross-modeling layer. After that, a gating layer fuses and transmits these features to the prediction layer for estimating unknown QoS values. In this way, TAN provides a flexible framework that can comprehensively capture the invocation context for making accurate QoS prediction.

The latest TDS prototype appears as a wireless headphone and has been tested in human subject trials. However, the robustness of the external TDS (eTDS) in real-life outdoor conditions may not meet safety regulations because of the limited mechanical stability of the headset. The intraoral TDS (iTDS), which is in the shape of a dental retainer, firmly clasps to the upper teeth and resists sensor misplacement. However, the iTDS has more restrictions on its dimensions, limiting the battery size and consequently requiring a considerable reduction in its power consumption to operate over an extended period of two days on a single charge. In this brief, we propose an ultralow-power local processor for the TDS that performs all signal processing on the transmitter side, following the sensors. Assuming the TDS user on average issuing one command/s, implementing the computational engine reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted to a PC or smartphone by a factor of 1500×, from 12 kb/s to ~8 b/s.

10.1109/TKDE.2019.2936189,Truth Discovery by Claim and Source Embedding,IEEE,Journals,"Information gathered from multiple sources on the Web often exhibits conflicts. This phenomenon motivates the need of truth discovery, which aims to automatically find the true claim among multiple conflicting claims. Existing truth discovery methods are mainly based on iterative updates, optimization or probabilistic models. Although these methods have shown their own effectiveness, they have a common limitation. These methods do not model relationships between each pair of source and target such that they do not well capture the underlying interactions in the data. In this paper, we propose a new model for truth discovery, learning the representations of sources and claims automatically from the interactions between sources and targets. Our model first constructs a heterogenous network including source-claim, source-source and truth-claim relationships. It then embeds the network into a low dimensional space such that trustworthy sources and true claims are close. In this way, truth discovery can be conveniently performed in the embedding space. Moreover, our model can be implemented in both semi-supervised and un-supervised manners to deal with the label scarcity problem in practical truth discovery. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for truth discovery.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807324/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 March 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TPAMI.2008.74,Twin Kernel Embedding,IEEE,Journals,"In most existing dimensionality reduction algorithms, the main objective is to preserve relational structure among objects of the input space in a low dimensional embedding space. This is achieved by minimizing the inconsistency between two similarity/dissimilarity measures, one for the input data and the other for the embedded data, via a separate matching objective function. Based on this idea, a new dimensionality reduction method called twin kernel embedding (TKE) is proposed. TKE addresses the problem of visualizing non-vectorial data that is difficult for conventional methods in practice due to the lack of efficient vectorial representation. TKE solves this problem by minimizing the inconsistency between the similarity measures captured respectively by their kernel gram matrices in the two spaces. In the implementation, by optimizing a nonlinear objective function using the gradient descent algorithm, a local minimum can be reached. The results obtained include both the optimal similarity preserving embedding and the appropriate values for the hyperparameters of the kernel. Experimental evaluation on real non-vectorial datasets confirmed the effectiveness of TKE. TKE can be applied to other types of data beyond those mentioned in this paper whenever suitable measures of similarity/dissimilarity can be defined on the input data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4479481/,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,Aug. 2008,ieeexplore

Optimization of navigation under such circumstance has long been an open problem: 1) to meet the critical requirements of this task typically including the shortest distance and smoothness and 2) more challengingly, to enable a general solution to track the optimal path in real-time outdoor applications. Aiming at the problem, this study develops a two-tier approach to navigation optimization in terms of path planning and tracking. First, a “rope”model has been designed to mimic the deformation of a path in axial direction under external force and the fixedness of the radial plane to contain a UGV in a collision-free space. Second, a deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm has been trained efficiently on abstracted structures of an arbitrarily derived “rope”to model the controller for tracking the optimal path. The learned policy can be generalized to a variety of scenarios. Experiments have been performed over complicated environments of different types. The results indicate that: 1) the rope model helps in minimizing distance and enhancing smoothness of the path, while guarantees the clearance; 2) the DPG can be modeled quickly (in a couple of minutes on an office desktop) and the model can apply to environments of increasing complexity under the circumstance of external disturbances without the need for tuning parameters; and 3) the DPG-based controller can autonomously adjust the UGV to follow the correct path free of risks by itself.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8476521/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

The key problem is to handle the unconformities or distortions among view-specific samples or measurements of similarity or dissimilarity. This paper models the view-specific samples as a nonlinear mapping of uniform but latent intact samples for all the views, and the view-specific dissimilarity matrices or similarity matrices are estimated in terms of the uniform latent one. Two methods are then developed for multi-view clustering. One makes use of uniform multidimensional scaling (UMDS) on multi-view dissimilarities or kernels. The other one uses a uniform class assignment (UCA) procedure that optimally extracts the cluster components contained in the view-specific similarity matrices. These two methods result in the same optimization model, subjected to some slightly different constraints. A first-order condition of solutions is given as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and a second order condition guarantees local optimality.

Based on the nodes' embeddings, downstream network analytic tasks such as community mining, node classification, and link prediction, can then be easily implemented using traditional machine learning methods. In recent years, extensive network embedding methods have been proposed based on factorization, random walks, deep learning, and so on. However, most of them focus mainly on preserving the structural proximity of network nodes, where highly interconnected nodes in a network will be represented closely together in the embedded vector space. While in many real-world networks, existing studies have revealed that high-order organizations (e.g., network motifs and graphlets) may be related to specific network functions. In this case, nodes far apart but with a similar organization in a network (i.e., structural equivalence) may have similar network functions. Accordingly, in this paper, we present a hybrid embedding method that unifies both structural proximity and equivalence (SPaE) of a network. Specifically, we adopt the concept of graphlet degree vector (GDV) to measure structural equivalence between network nodes. Through carrying out experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we evaluate the performance of the hybrid embedding method in tasks of node clustering, node classification, and visualization. The results demonstrate that the proposed SPaE method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods when the network analytic tasks are not merely related to structural proximity.

The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch, learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image stitching is presented and released.

For improved robustness to intra-class variations, deep Siamese networks have recently been used for pair-wise face matching. Although these networks can improve state-of-the-art accuracy, the absence of prior knowledge from the target domain means that many images must be collected to account for all possible capture conditions, which is not practical for many real-world surveillance applications. In this paper, we propose the deep SiamSRC network that employs block-sparsity for face matching, while the reference gallery is augmented with a compact set of domain-specific facial images. Prior to deployment, clustering based on row sparsity is performed on unlabelled faces captured in videos from the target domain. Cluster centers discovered in the capture condition space (defined by, e.g., pose, scale and illumination) are used as rendering parameters with an off-the-shelf 3D face model, and a compact set of synthetic faces are thereby generated for each reference still based on representative intra-class information from the target domain. For pair-wise similarity matching with query facial images, the SiamSRC exploits sparse representation-based classification with a block structure. Experimental results obtained with the videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V datasets indicate that the proposed SiamSRC network can outperform state-of-the-art methods for still-to-video FR with a single sample per person, with only a moderate increase in computational complexity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8883245/,"IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science",April 2020,ieeexplore

Analagous to the result for traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution, generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra expansions in euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative to baseline non-euclidean CNNs.

Designing a wind farm is becoming more and more complex especially with the recent trend towards large farms. Finding the optimal locations of wind turbines inside a wind farm to reduce energy cost is a highly challenging task, as it requires the handling of conflicting criteria and depending on the number of turbines considered it can turn to a large scale-optimization problem. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to place efficiently wind turbines inside a given area considering all constraints. This problem formulated as an optimization problem is referred to as the wind farm layout optimization (WFLO) problem. This real-world problem is nonlinear and difficult to solve using classical optimization algorithms and it has to take into consideration wind scenarios, power curve and wake effects. For this purpose, a binary version of the most valuable player algorithm (MVPA) called BMVPA is developed and implemented. Furthermore, ten scenarios were investigated using different wind speeds, terrain sizes with and without obstacles. For the same terrain but including obstacles, it was found that the energy cost increased due to the presence of obstacles that could limit the search space and consequently reduces the number of available options. The empirical results obtained using BMVPA were compared with those obtained using other well-known algorithms like the binary particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. BMVPA showed better results in solving the WFLO problem than the comparative algorithms.

The large spectral variability of man-made structures, as well as the mixed pixel phenomenon, imposes the use of computational demanding techniques, which are not always effective for real case applications. Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, which are mainly used for classification and regression analysis. Specifically, a support vector classifier (SVC) constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which separates the training data into different classes. These are then used to classify a whole image, or series of images. The current standard SVM algorithm for classification used by the most popular mapping software (e.g., ENVI, EnMAP) is the C-SVC. The parameterization of a C-SVC strongly affects the final classification result. Yet, there is no rule of thumb to choose the optimal parameters when classifying satellite imagery. Optimal parameterization totally depends on the training data, and to determine it for a specific case, a time-consuming trial-and-error process is inevitable.

Applying Deep Neural Networks (i.e., DNNs) in computer vision can achieve a high detection accuracy but it requires a huge amount of computing power, storage space, and video data. Thus, DNNs-based video analytics is mostly deployed in the cloud with video data steaming from a set of stationary cameras. There are mainly three issues in this setting. First, steaming a huge amount of video data from cameras to cloud leads to high bandwidth consumption and latency. Second, when DNNs are deployed on resource-limited devices like edge nodes to reduce communication costs, it is hard to achieve a high detection accuracy. Third, stationary cameras can only collect a limited amount of video data that covers a small area, so it barely satisfies the needs of the real-time analytics in applications like public safety. We propose a mobile edge computing-based video stream processing platform, mVideo, which conducts video analytics making full use of resources at the collaborative edge and cloud nodes. On the mVideo, a mechanism is designed to partition a video analysis task based on available resources on the mobile edge node. Then, the edge nodes pre-process video data using a lightweight DNN model and upload the results to cloud nodes for further analysis. Thus mVideo not only collects video data that covers a large area, but also reduces the communication costs. To validate the proposed platform, a face recognition application is deployed on the mVideo prototype. Experimental results reveal that compared with the existing cloud computing model, mVideo reduces video data volume transmitted to the cloud nodes and power consumption by up to 99.5% and 96.2%, respectively. mVideo also improves the execution time by 90.0% to optimize mobile video analytics performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8945324/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

In traditional courses, aerospace-related disciplines are independently distributed in different courses, and there is rarely a hands-on platform which includes signal processing, control theory, and artificial intelligence into Aerospace engineering. Facing this problem, this paper designs a multidisciplinary comprehensive experiment, aiming to provide a hand-on platform and flexible project-based program to students of aerospace engineering professions. First of all, in order to let the students understand actual aerospace problems, a multidisciplinary simulation platform containing UAVs and remote objects scenarios is constructed for them to explore in the experiments. Second, the content of the experiment is designed into three stages including data acquisition and processing, conceptual design and simulation, in-flight validation, during which the multidisciplinary engineering ability runs through the whole process of the activities. Finally, Project Oriented Design Based Learning is also introduced here to combine engineering design education with innovation and creativity. Through the project demonstration and presentation at the end of the experiment, the multidisciplinary engineering ability of each student can be effectively evaluated. The UVN comprehensive experiment enables students to work on real-world aerospace engineering problems through a hardware-software integration framework, which may greatly stimulate their curiosity and interest in autonomously learning. It also provides students unprecedented opportunities to immerse themselves in projects that cross disciplinary boundaries, improve their professional ability and enhance their exploration competence in aerospace areas.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9273977/,2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),21-24 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICARM52023.2021.9536056,A Review of Bilateral Teleoperation Control Strategies with Soft Environment,IEEE,Conferences,"In the past two decades, bilateral teleoperation with haptic feedback has attracted great research and application interests in both robotics and other areas. Initially triggered by the need to handle dangerous and remote distance tasks such as nuclear materials manipulation and space exploration, bilateral teleoperation has found its way into other applications as a result of development of control theory, robotic technology (both hardware and software) and latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Consequently, bilateral teleoperation is found facing new challenges brought by these new applications. One major and obvious change is the working environment for the slave manipulator: different from rigid or solid contact environments which are reasonably assumed in early applications in industrial, nuclear and aerospace applications, the slave environment is now more complex and often the objects in contact are much softer in term of stiffness and can not be described by simple elastic model if good teleoperation performance (accurate and transparent) is expected. In this paper, the research of bilateral teleoperation system considering soft environment in recent 20 years has been surveyed for the first time in literature, to the knowledge of the authors. Following the difference in real applications, in this review the definition of soft environment covers linear elastic environment with much lower stiffness than conventional industrial environment and nonlinear complex soft environment with/out time-varying characteristics. Accordingly, the surveyed control strategies and structures in recent literature to improve the stability and accuracy of bilateral teleoperation with soft environment are classified and explained. Finally, the main applications, current challenges and future perspectives of bilateral teleoperation with soft environment are discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9536056/,2021 6th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM),3-5 July 2021,ieeexplore

One of the essential parameters in Li-ion batteries is state of charge (SOC) that shows the available energy in a battery. Various methods were proposed for SOC estimation. Since the battery has a nonlinear equations, it is important to use a method that does not require the system model. In the present study, a new Adaptive Online Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) method is proposed for the State of Charge (SOC) estimation. It is a kind of deep Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) which solved the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs with GRU units. For Optimization a robust adaptive Online gradient learning method is used. This method is able to tune online the learning rate in the process. Adaptive GRU is a nondependent method from the nonlinear batteries model and simplifies the mathematical computation.

Polygon transform representations of the object provide the inputs to a BARTIN (Bayesian Real Time Network) that generates the inspection decisions. This implementation employs a distance measure related to Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the difference between sample polygon transforms, and demonstrates the parsimony and reliability of the BARTIN architecture.

10.1109/C2I454156.2021.9689446,Challenges in Design and Development of Electron Beam Weld Predictor Software,IEEE,Conferences,"Electron beam welding (EBW) is high power density welding process used predominantly for fabrication of launch vehicles and spacecrafts made of aerospace grade materials. EBW process at LPSC-ISRO is a space qualified process and the cost and time involved in imbibing quality into the EBW process amounts to 65% of the total fabrication costs and 80 % of the total welding time. The weld quality is ensured by evaluating a pre-weld WTS (Weld Test Specimen), each time a weld is done.. The LPSC-ISRO-Bangalore, houses many variants of EBW machines and in order to tap, utilise the huge potential of empirical data available in-house, this software has been designed and developed to predict the EBW machine parameters for a given material and geometry details. The software developed is based on machine learning of the empirical data. The accuracy of prediction results have been validated using EBW experiments and presently the first version of the software is available for deployment in ISRO and continual improvement of prediction accuracies is ensured by enhancing the database with additional reference points. The software aids in reduction of total manufacturing cost and lead time as the WTS (Weld Test Specimen) requirements have been substantially reduced with aid of this software. Unlike software development for electrical and electronic systems, the challenges in design and development of software for mechanical systems (EBW machines in this design) commences with limited data availability in assessable form; data collection and assimilation are humongous as it is based on almost 20 nos of parameters related to EBW machine and weld quality and not all parameters are in measurable or assessable format. Despite this limitation, the software has been developed in two phases including feature extraction studies in phase2 thus enhancing the prediction accuracies achieved in phase1(a primitive and draft software design). Also the other challenges are input and output parameters for the software are in analog format &amp; knowledge based (interpretation needs skill); the empirical data is predominantly dependent on physics of EBW such as geometry, material properties and software accuracy to be validated by real-time physical EBW experiments. The challenges have been overcome by ensuring precision in empirical data collection, assimilation and cleansing and also feature extraction studies indicated the relevance in selection of input parameters. The selection of machine learning algorithm is also based on the applicability of the selected algorithm to address all the above challenges endured. Also the experimental results validated the prediction accuracies achieved via the Phase2 developed software. Despite the challenges endured, the indigenously designed, developed and validated EBW predictor software can predict EBW machine parameters (beam current and focus current) without any need to weld a WTS and hence, the software developed aids in reduction of the total manufacturing cost and also the lead time involved in realisation of launch vehicles and spacecrafts for various ISRO missions have been substantially reduced with induction of this EBW Predictor software.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9689446/,"2021 2nd International Conference on Communication, Computing and Industry 4.0 (C2I4)",16-17 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

10.23919/EATS52162.2021.9704856,Data-Driven Modeling of Dynamic Systems Based on Online Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents modeling and prediction of the unknown dynamics from a variety of real-time operation data in complex physical processes or systems based on machine learning. More generally, this is a data-driven modeling approach based on physical knowledge at time of design and machine learning at runtime. The learning process may apply to the entire or partial system dynamics, while portions of the physical system dynamics may be known or given. The learned models together with the known physics-based equations can be widely used in control system design, for instance, as one component in a model predictive control (MPC) framework for integrated dynamic systems. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are chosen here, because they have additional stored states resulting from the past output, and the state storage can be internally controlled subject to the network status itself. Such controlled states can be regarded as gated states or memory blocks in a neural network, and they serve as key components of the LSTM neural network in controlling the information flow throughout the network. This paper provides technical details about the concept of a LSTM neural network that can be used to model and predict energy production in renewable sources, battery state of charge, engine fuel use (or energy efficiency), or energy demand of the payload in aerospace or energy system applications. The most compute-intensive part of the learning algorithm is solving a nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the total error between the predicted and actual outputs. After updating the learned model and parameters, the LSTM model implementation may perform certain computational steps in parallel, so as to accelerate the computing. The model learning and prediction processes can be implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA - a reconfigurable parallel computing device), for instance, on NI’s CompactRIO modules or PXI FPGA modules. As an example, an application of the LSTM model is studied in this paper to learn and predict the varying power generation from intermittent sources based on historical and real-time operational data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9704856/,2021 AIAA/IEEE Electric Aircraft Technologies Symposium (EATS),11-13 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

Aircraft manufacturers and top-tier suppliers now rely on robotics to perform most of its operational tasks. Over the years, a succession of implemented mobile robots has been developed with the mission of automating important industrial processes such as welding, material handling or assembly procedures. However, despite the progress achieved, a major limitation is that the process still requires human supervision and an extensive quality control process. An approach to address this limitation is to integrate machine learning methods within the quality control process. The idea is to develop algorithms that can direct manufacturing experts towards critical areas requiring human supervision and quality control. In this paper we present an application of machine learning to a concrete industrial problem involving the quality control of a riveting machine. The proposal consists of an intelligent predictive model that can be integrated within the existing real time sensing and pre-processing sub-systems at the equipment level. The framework makes use of several data-driven techniques for pre-processing and feature engineering, combined with the most accurate algorithms, validated through k-folds cross validation technique which also estimates prediction errors.

Such an approach relies on layering autonomy onto existing architecture while making minimal changes to the existing FSW. This is distinctly different from a revolutionary approach, which calls for integrating the design of autonomy and FSW from the start. While a revolutionary approach may lead to a more optimal design, an evolutionary approach allows for reuse of proven FSW, facilitates the complicated process of software verification and validation, and accelerates acceptance by the aerospace community. Because intelligent autonomous agents are typically soft real-time processes while FSW typically meets hard real-time requirements, applying the evolutionary approach is not a straightforward task. One technique available for solving this problem is Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA). RMA uses real-time scheduling theory to guarantee that all processes can be scheduled. It has been used successfully in real-time scheduling applications such as helicopter control systems.

Firstly, the problem statement is presented and the implied mathematical equations are shown. The theoretical model is based on the discretized form of a matrix differential equation solution, and focuses on its first six truncation order. In order to have an easier communication between the user and the software, especially in the off-line data processing applications, a Graphical User Interface is developed. The obtained software is validated by using an integrated INS/GPS navigation system as reference system, the inputs of our software being the outputs of the gyro sensors in the strap-down INS. The tool can be used in all strap-down inertial systems application fields like aerospace, naval and automotive navigation, robotics, as well as in medicine surgery.

The focus is on improving the modeling accuracy of the in-line hydrodynamic coupling between a two-link manipulator and a small, free-floating vehicle in order to achieve better control for coordinated motion of the combined system. Loads predicted using existing models for underwater arms were determined to be off by as much as 25% when applied to a real, two-link arm in a test tank. In this new approach, an experimentally-determined model has been developed that takes into account the 3D flow effects that have previously not been included. The end result is a model that provides accurate predictions for the joint torques of a two-link arm in a form simple enough to be implemented in algorithms for precision planning and control.

10.1109/ICPHM.2019.8819386,Part Name Normalization,IEEE,Conferences,"Parts information plays a key role in prognostics and health management. However, expressions of parts often have a wide range of variations, spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. Normalization of such terms is crucial for many applications. Part names post a major challenge also because they tend to be in the form of multi-word terms. In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method UNAMER (Unification and Normalization Analysis, Misspelling Evaluation and Recognition). It is a general method for identifying term variants, including multi-word term variants, and normalizing them under a canonical name. UNAMER does not rely on a predefined set of canonical terms, which is often hard to obtain. Given a term, UNAMER first identifies candidate variants by exploiting contextual information. It then uses a supervised machine learning model, trained using easy-to-generate examples, that leverages both contextual and lexical features to predict actual variants from the candidates. UNAMER further extends its capability to normalize multi-word parts, such as part names like `lt pnl', `letf pnl' and `lft panal' for `left panel' using a specialized linguistically motivated term alignment approach. UNAMER has been deployed in practical applications to normalize part names in the aerospace domain.

Research is also ongoing into how to improve the lives of ordinary citizens using robotic arms. Often, it is difficult for physically impaired individuals to complete tasks such as obtaining an object from a shelf, opening a refrigerator door, obtaining food or drink from the refrigerator, and picking a needed item from a drawer. Thus, they must rely on a caregiver to aid them with such tasks or complete these tasks for them. In such cases, a robotic arm could potentially be used to assist the visually impaired individual to pick up items. Prior work has described a system that takes in audio commands from an individual, applies natural language processing to identify the action required by the user, and combines this with object recognition and grasp detection to identify the object in the fridge. However, the limitation in that work was the different components were not integrated and there were inefficiencies in the process of grasp point detection from images.This work builds on existing research by integrating the object recognition and grasp detection components. The work describes a technique to dynamically adjust the size of the object image sent to the grasp point detection module by extracting only the portion necessary for grasp detection from the stream of camera images. This approach of separately performing the object recognition, identifying the portion of the object suitable for grasping (i.e., the handle), and dynamically determining the buffer zone around the handle for use in the grasp detection module reduces the amount of data transmitted between steps and enables real-time object recognition and grasp identification. The integrated framework with object recognition using a pre-trained model and dynamic grasp point detection program was successfully tested with an Intel RealSense D455 camera.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9666543/,"2021 IEEE 12th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)",1-4 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

On-board aerospace applications are characterized by limited storage and communication budgets, while lossless data compression schemes should be sufficient enough to enhance transmission efficiency and hence the whole aerospace mission. In this paper, a proposed two-stage lossless compression method for telemetry data is presented. The proposed method consists of a decorrelation stage and an entropy coding one. The Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is implemented as a predictor in the decorrelation stage of the proposed method, and an illustrative method of applying LSTM network for telemetry data samples prediction is presented and figured out. In experiments, different entropy coders: Rice codes, arithmetic method and Huffman algorithm are separately implemented at the second stage. The proposed method is tested by different real telemetry data sets of FUNcube satellite in frames of data words of 8-,10-,16-bits widths.

The aerospace and defense sectors have a number of stochastic optimization problems that would benefit from the application of ML; however, people often have difficulties interpreting solutions arrived at via ML, which undermines trust, producing an obstacle to widespread adoption in these sectors. This paper introduces the Self-Explaining Decision Architecture (SEDA) for ML-based decision-making systems capable of generating intuitive explanations for their decisions in real time. SEDA makes use of a feature extraction subsystem and a sequence interpretation subsystem to identify patterns in data followed by a decision generation subsystem that determines appropriate actions based on those patterns. Internal state information from each of these subsystems is used to generate explanations of the system’s decisions. Using this information to create explanations provides insight as to the data elements the system focused on when making decisions as well as the reasoning that was used.

10.1109/IMTC.1994.352108,Use of artificial neural networks for optimal sensing in complex structures analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Among the advantages offered by the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), in the analysis and active control of structures characterized by high modal densities and complexity, it should be mentioned the possibility of optimizing the number and the position of sensors and actuators. This feature can result in a sensible reduction of cost in the analysis and control of large structures and could be of great advantage when some of the points under investigation of the structure are not physically accessible. The first step of research is the validation of the ANN approach to a satisfactory analysis of the structure. Previous papers have highlighted the encouraging results obtained from an ANN implementation for the description of a stiffened aluminum panel behaviour. In that case the ANN was trained with data obtained by a validated FEM (Finite Element Method) structural model. In the simulation phase the ANN estimated the behaviour of all the grid points with data referred only to a portion of points with interesting performances in terms of accuracy and computing time. The present paper describes a measurement system in which the ANN is trained with real data, experimentally obtained by accelerometers. The investigation was carried out considering a sinusoidal excitation, typically produced by the rotating engines of turboprob aircrafts. Real data allowed us to rest the ability of the ANN to learn the structural dynamics taking into the right account the influence of noise, not considered in the previous phase of the research. The experimental results highlight again the good ANN behaviour accuracy in the estimation of all the rest points considered for the analysis.

We show that the method is able to detect permanent faults occurring in some critical modules, thus allowing to increase the overall reliability of the system.

DAS is composed of design, independent monitoring and airworthiness functions in which these functions are specialized for aerospace industry. Besides, Design Organization Approval (DOA) is a milestone to establish a rigid Design Assurance System. By this way, design organization assures aircraft development life cycle by complying with aviation regulations.

In this article, we suggest enhancing the security of MIL-STD-1553 communication buses by integrating a machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS); such anIDS will be capable of detecting cyber attacks in real time. The IDS consists of two modules: 1) a remote terminal (RT) authentication module that detects illegitimately connected components and data transfers and 2) a sequence-based anomaly detection module that detects anomalies in the operation of the system. The IDS showed high detection rates for both normal and abnormal behavior when evaluated in a testbed using real 1553 hardware, as well as a very fast and accurate training process using logs from a real system. The RT authentication module managed to authenticate RTs with +0.99 precision and +0.98 recall; and detect illegitimate component (or a legitimate component that impersonates other components) with +0.98 precision and +0.99 recall.

,An adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy control approach for motion control of a spacecraft maneuver,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper proposes an adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy control approach to predict the torque required to control the attitude and rate in a spacecraft maneuver. In the real world environment, the mathematical models of many complex systems are often not accurate, due to the presence of continuous disturbances that effect their dynamic equations, in addition to errors in parameter knowledge. Consequently, methods that rely less on precise mathematical models are often preferred. One such Adaptive Machine Learning Technique is proposed for motion control in spacecraft maneuver. The controller uses an inverse learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model only to train itself from certain desired trajectories and tries to mimic the same in its response. Ideally, these training trajectories are obtained by directly measuring the spacecraft manuever response for various test inputs. Once the system is fully trained, the manuever is tested on a new trajectory with uncertain plant dynamics. However, for algorithm validation, trajectories generated through simulations based on mathematical models assumed to be reasonably accurate, can also be used for the training purpose.

Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults.

Anomaly detection is an important field for the anticipation of spacecraft operations, working as an enabler of diagnostic and prognostic functions. This article discusses a new real application of a well-known data driven statistical software known as soft independent modeling for class analogy (SIMCA-P) developed by Umetrics to historical telemetry for attitude determination and control system (ADCS) of actual remote sensing spacecraft. Our design work is to detect anomalies from mission control center (MCC) through analyzing the telemetry readings received by MCC and respond to ADCS off-nominal situations by sending corrective actions tele-commands within real time to avoid critical and risky situations.

10.1109/AERO.2015.7119180,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to achieve a robust architecture for future robotic spacecraft,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator. The avionics and robot control were integrated on an embedded, space-qualified Airbus e.Cube on-board computer. The experiments showed that the integration of SOM for robot failure detection positively complemented the capabilities of traditional FDIR methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7119180/,2015 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2015,ieeexplore

Hence, the current approach to the development of real-time guidance laws for these advanced space vehicles is to use approximation theory to obtain closed-loop guidance laws. Neural networks offer an alternative to the derivation and implementation of guidance laws. In this paper, we formulate the space vehicle guidance problem using a neural network approach and investigate the appropriate neural net architecture for modelling optimum guidance trajectories. In particular, we investigate the incorporation of a priori knowledge about the characteristics of the optimal guidance solution into the neural network architecture.

10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438232,A Pipeline for Vision-Based On-Orbit Proximity Operations Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Imagery,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep learning has become the gold standard for image processing over the past decade. Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities such as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity operations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an effective system for model development that streamlines data curation, training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges. The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a cloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset, to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses (positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code. Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality. Remote development, scalable compute, and automatic organization of data and artifacts have dramatically decreased iteration time while increasing reproducibility and system comprehension. Diverse, high-fidelity synthetic images that more closely replicate the real environment have improved model performance against real-world data. These results demonstrate that the presented pipeline offers tangible benefits to the application of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438232/,2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100),6-13 March 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/IROS.2014.6942859,A machine learning approach for real-time reachability analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Assessing reachability for a dynamical system, that is deciding whether a certain state is reachable from a given initial state within a given cost threshold, is a central concept in controls, robotics, and optimization. Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10% (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods.

,An adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy control approach for motion control of a spacecraft maneuver,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper proposes an adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy control approach to predict the torque required to control the attitude and rate in a spacecraft maneuver. In the real world environment, the mathematical models of many complex systems are often not accurate, due to the presence of continuous disturbances that effect their dynamic equations, in addition to errors in parameter knowledge. Consequently, methods that rely less on precise mathematical models are often preferred. One such Adaptive Machine Learning Technique is proposed for motion control in spacecraft maneuver. The controller uses an inverse learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model only to train itself from certain desired trajectories and tries to mimic the same in its response. Ideally, these training trajectories are obtained by directly measuring the spacecraft manuever response for various test inputs. Once the system is fully trained, the manuever is tested on a new trajectory with uncertain plant dynamics. However, for algorithm validation, trajectories generated through simulations based on mathematical models assumed to be reasonably accurate, can also be used for the training purpose. This approach is used for design and implementation of an ANFIS controller which is shown to work satisfactorily.

Interesting or anomalous phenomena must be quickly characterized and followed up with additional measurements via optimal deployment of limited assets. Modern astronomy presents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital synoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray bursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially hazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning tools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.

ML has many potential applications in the space domain. Next generation space instruments are producing data at rates that exceed the capabilities of current spacecraft to store or transmit to ground stations. Deployment of ML algorithms onboard future spacecraft could perform processing of sensor data as it is gathered, reducing data volume and providing a dramatic increase in throughput of meaningful data. ML techniques may also be used to enhance the autonomy of space missions. However ML techniques have not yet been widely deployed in space environments, primarily due to limitations on the computational capabilities of spaceflight hardware. The need to verify that high-performance computational hardware can reliably operate in this environment delays the adoption of these technologies. Nevertheless, the availability of advanced processing capabilities onboard spacecraft is increasing. These platforms may not provide the processing power of terrestrial equivalents, but they do provide the resources necessary for deploying real-time execution of ML algorithms. In this paper, we present results exploring the implementation of ML techniques on computationally-constrained, high-reliability spacecraft hardware.

Such an approach relies on layering autonomy onto existing architecture while making minimal changes to the existing FSW. This is distinctly different from a revolutionary approach, which calls for integrating the design of autonomy and FSW from the start. While a revolutionary approach may lead to a more optimal design, an evolutionary approach allows for reuse of proven FSW, facilitates the complicated process of software verification and validation, and accelerates acceptance by the aerospace community. Because intelligent autonomous agents are typically soft real-time processes while FSW typically meets hard real-time requirements, applying the evolutionary approach is not a straightforward task. One technique available for solving this problem is Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA). RMA uses real-time scheduling theory to guarantee that all processes can be scheduled. It has been used successfully in real-time scheduling applications such as helicopter control systems.

Moore's Law turns the supercomputers of yesterday into the laptops of today, but space computing remains relatively underpowered due to the harsh radiation environment and low risk-tolerance of most space missions. Space missions are generally low risk because of the high cost of components and launch. However, launch costs are drastically decreasing and innovations such as CubeSats are changing the risk equation. By accepting more risk and utilizing commercial of the shelf (COTS) parts, it is possible to cheaply build and launch extremely capable computing platforms into space. High performance satellites will be required for advanced interplanetary exploration due to latency challenges. The long transmission times between planets means satellites or robotic explorers need onboard processing to perform tasks in real-time. This paper explores one possible application that could be hosted onboard the next generation of high performance satellites, performing object classification on satellite imagery. Automation of satellite imagery processing is currently performed by servers or workstations on Earth, but this paper will show that those algorithms can be moved onboard satellites by using COTS components. First traditional computer vision techniques such as edge detection and sliding windows are used to detect possible objects on the open ocean. Then a modern neural network architecture is used to classify the object as a ship or not.

Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults.

In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator. The avionics and robot control were integrated on an embedded, space-qualified Airbus e.Cube on-board computer. The experiments showed that the integration of SOM for robot failure detection positively complemented the capabilities of traditional FDIR methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7119180/,2015 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172453,Utilizing Reinforcement Learning to Autonomously Mange Buffers in a Delay Tolerant Network Node,IEEE,Conferences,"In order to effectively communicate with Earth from deep space there is a need for network automation similar to that of the Internet. The existing automated network protocols, such as TCP and IP, cannot work in deep space due to the assumptions under which they were designed. Specifically, protocols assume the existence of an end-to-end path between the source and destination for the entirety of a communication session and the path being traversable in a negligible amount of time. In contrast, a Delay Tolerant Network is a set of protocols that allows networking in environments where links suffer from high-delay or disruptions (e.g. Deep Space). These protocols rely on different assumptions such as time synchronization and suitable memory allocation. In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomously avoiding memory overflows in a Delay Tolerant Node. To that end, we propose using Reinforcement Learning to automate buffer management given that we can easily measure the relative rates of data coming in and out of the DTN node. In the case of detecting overflow, we let the autonomous agent choose between three actions: slowing down the client, requesting more resources from the Deep Space Network, or selectively dropping packets once the buffer nears capacity. Furthermore, we show that all of these actions can be realistically implemented in real-life operations given current and planned capabilities of Delay Tolerant Networking and the Deep Space Network. Similarly, we also show that using Reinforcement Learning for this problem is well suited to this application due to the number of possible states and variables, as well as the fact that large distances between deep space spacecraft and Earth prevent human-in-the-loop intervention.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172453/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064928,Deep Space Network Scheduling via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,IEEE,Journals,"NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) is a globally-spanning communications network responsible for supporting the interplanetary spacecraft missions of NASA and other international users. The DSN is a highly utilized asset, and the large demand for its’ services makes the assignment of DSN resources a daunting computational problem. In this paper we study the DSN scheduling problem, which is the problem of assigning the DSN’s limited resources to its users within a given time horizon. The DSN scheduling problem is oversubscribed, meaning that only a subset of the activities can be scheduled, and network operators must decide which activities to exclude from the schedule. We first formulate this challenging scheduling task as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem. Next, we develop a sequential algorithm which solves the resulting MILP formulation to produce valid schedules for large-scale instances of the DSN scheduling problem. We use real world DSN data from week 44 of 2016 in order to evaluate our algorithm’s performance. We find that given a fixed run time, our algorithm outperforms a simple implementation of our MILP model, generating a feasible schedule in which 17% more activities are scheduled by the algorithm than by the simple implementation. We design a non-MILP based heuristic to further validate our results. We find that our algorithm also outperforms this heuristic, scheduling 8% more activities and 20% more tracking time than the best results achieved by the non-MILP implementation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9373338/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/JPROC.2018.2849003,SMC: Satisfiability Modulo Convex Programming,IEEE,Journals,"The design of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) requires methods and tools that can efficiently reason about the interaction between discrete models, e.g., representing the behaviors of “cyber” components, and continuous models of physical processes. Boolean methods such as satisfiability (SAT) solving are successful in tackling large combinatorial search problems for the design and verification of hardware and software components. On the other hand, problems in control, communications, signal processing, and machine learning often rely on convex programming as a powerful solution engine. However, despite their strengths, neither approach would work in isolation for CPSs. In this paper, we present a new satisfiability modulo convex programming (SMC) framework that integrates SAT solving and convex optimization to efficiently reason about Boolean and convex constraints at the same time. We exploit the properties of a class of logic formulas over Boolean and nonlinear real predicates, termed monotone satisfiability modulo convex formulas, whose satisfiability can be checked via a finite number of convex programs. Following the lazy satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) paradigm, we develop a new decision procedure for monotone SMC formulas, which coordinates SAT solving and convex programming to provide a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable. A key step in our coordination scheme is the efficient generation of succinct infeasibility proofs for inconsistent constraints that can support conflict-driven learning and accelerate the search. We demonstrate our approach on different CPS design problems, including spacecraft docking mission control, robotic motion planning, and secure state estimation. We show that SMC can handle more complex problem instances than state-of-the-art alternative techniques based on SMT solving and mixed integer convex programming.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8428633/,Proceedings of the IEEE,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore
