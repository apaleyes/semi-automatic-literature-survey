337301137,2021-06-17T00:00:00,"Deep learning-based sequential recommender systems have recently attracted
increasing attention from both academia and industry. Most of industrial
Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) system for recommendation share the similar
ideas with sequential recommenders. Among them, how to comprehensively capture
sequential user interest is a fundamental problem. However, most existing
sequential recommendation models take as input clicked or purchased behavior
sequences from user-item interactions. This leads to incomprehensive user
representation and sub-optimal model performance, since they ignore the
complete user behavior exposure data, i.e., items impressed yet unclicked by
users. In this work, we attempt to incorporate and model those unclicked item
sequences using a new learning approach in order to explore better sequential
recommendation technique. An efficient triplet metric learning algorithm is
proposed to appropriately learn the representation of unclicked items. Our
method can be simply integrated with existing sequential recommendation models
by a confidence fusion network and further gain better user representation. The
offline experimental results based on real-world E-commerce data demonstrate
the effectiveness and verify the importance of unclicked items in sequential
recommendation. Moreover we deploy our new model (named XDM) into EBR of
recommender system at Taobao, outperforming the deployed previous generation

343432594,2017-03-01T00:00:00,"Frank Kendall, then Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, released the first defense acquisition system performance report in June 2013. This report focused primarily on performance related to the collective outcomes of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs), but additionally explored various descriptive dimensions and acquisition approaches of the same (Kendall, 2013). Each annual report builds on the work previously conducted, and focuses on data-driven analysis relying on statistical techniques to identify trends that improve the defense acquisition communityﾒs insights into how contract incentives are motivating better contractor/vendor performance (Kendal, 2016). Nevertheless, large amounts of data (in modern jargon, ﾓBig Dataﾔ) are now available for research in the area of defense acquisition. Over the past several years, changes in electronic commerce have increased the amounts of both structured and unstructured data availableﾗboth in runtime and archived environments. This electronic data, from a variety of different acquisition agencies, can be obtained by a variety of means and used for a multitude of purposes (Snider et al., 2014). Traditional statistical and trend analysis methods thus far have been primarily relied upon to explore trends and test metrics in the sets of acquisition data at hand. Sometimes, spreadsheets of linear regression correlation are employed, or, in some more modern applications, multivariate structural equation models via scientific applications such as SPSS and AMOS are leveraged for their ability to evaluate complex variable relationships, such as nested or recursive if-then patterns (Byrne, 2016). However, not only are todayﾒs modern datasets large in magnitude, they are also large in variety and complexity (Gartner, 2013). Furthermore, to address this state of data, new statistical modeling techniques, more powerful than before, have had to be created. This is due to the older methods finding difficulty with some of the size problems Big Data represents, such as privacy and security concerns (Parms, 2017). Thankfully, computer power necessary to employ the modern techniques is less expensive today, the software near free, and the storage capacities available now yield bewildering capacities at a fingertip, and with amazingly fast access speed. In fact, these performance parameters appear to continue along a Mooreﾒs trend line against critical opposition (Magee, Basnet, Funk, & Benson, 2015). Presently, one of the more interesting of the new statistical modeling techniques is neural network algorithm machine learning. Neural network modeling involves utilizing a ﾓpowerful computational data model that is able to capture and represent input/output relationships.ﾔ This model was developed out of the desire to create artificial intelligence systems capable of completing functions that were previously executed solely by the human brain. One benefit of using neural network modeling lies with its capacity to display and comprehend both linear and non-linear relationships from the data to which it is supplied (NeuroSolutions, 2015). Research Question Because ﾓBig Dataﾔ is present in the Defense Acquisition Business space, and, because the demand to critically understand real cause-and-effect relationships between variables within that data is persistent from the Acquisition community, this paperﾒs research question is, Can a neural network modeling technique be confidently relied upon to meaningfully explore variable relationships within acquisition business datasets? Because, if it is, then any question may be reasonably asked by anyone of such a dataset; and, via the neural network-enabled tool, the answers they receive will come with scientific statistical confidence as to whether they can be trusted as interesting or useful answers.1 In order to explore this research question, the study opted to use business data on contractor performance and attempted to isolate predictive variables from past performance information predictive of good performance.Naval Postgraduate School Acquisition Research Progra",Data Consolidation of Disparate Procurement Data Sources for Correlated Performance-Based Acquisition Decision Support,https://core.ac.uk/download/343432594.pdf,"Monterey, California.

33799208,2008-03-19T00:00:00,"Nowadays, more and more applications require systems that can interact with humans. Agents can be perceived as computing services that humans, or even other agents, can request in order to accomplish their tasks. Some services may be simple and others rather complex. A way to determine the best agents (services) to be implemented is to identify who the actors are in the object of study, which roles they play, and (if possible) what kind of knowledge they use. 
Socially Intelligent Agents (SIAs) are agent systems that are able to connect and interface with humans, i.e. robotic or computational systems that show aspects of human-style social intelligence. In addition to their relevance in application areas such as e-commerce and entertainment, building artefacts in software and hardware has been recognized as a powerful tool for establishing a science of social minds which is a constructive approach toward understanding social intelligence in humans and other animals.
Social intelligence in humans and other animals has a number of fascinating facets and implications for the design of SIAs. Human beings are biological agents that are embodied members of a social environment and are autobiographic agents who have a unique personality. They are situated in time and space and interpret new experiences based on reconstructions of previous experiences. Due to their physical embodiment, they have a unique perspective on the world and a unique history: an autobiography. Also, humans are able to express and recognize emotions, that are important in regulating individual survival and problem-solving as well as social interactions.
Like artificial intelligence research trend, SIA research trend can be pursued with different goals in mind. A deep AI approach seeks to simulate real social intelligence and processes. A shallow AI approach, which will be highlighted also within this thesis, aims to create artefacts that are not socially intelligent per se, but rather appear socially intelligent to a given user. The shallow approach does not seek to create social intelligence unless it is meaningful social intelligence vis-à-vis some user situation
In order to develop believable SIAs we do not have to know how beliefs-desires and intentions actually relate to each other in the real minds of the people. If one wants to create the impression of an artificial social agent driven by beliefs and desires, it is enough to draw on investigations on how people with different cultural background, develop and use theories of mind to understand the behaviours of others. Therefore, SIA technology needs to model the folk-theory reasoning rather than the real thing. To a shallow AI approach, a model of mind based on folk-psychology is as valid as one based on cognitive theory. 
Distance education is understood as online learning that is technology-based training which encompasses both computer-assisted and Web-based training. These systems, which appear to offer something for everyone at any time, in any place, do not always live up to the great promise they offer.
The usage of social intelligent agents in online learning environments can enable the design of “enhanced-learning environments” that allow for the development and the assessment of social competences as well as the common professional competences. 

Within this thesis it is shown how to corroborate affective theory with role theory with agent technology in a synchronous virtual environment in order to overcome several inconveniences of distance education systems. This research embraces also the shallow approach of SIA and aims to provide the first steps of a method for creating a believable life-like tutor agent which can partially replace human-teachers and assist the students in the process of learning. The starting point for this research came from the fact: anxious, angry or depressed students do not learn; people in these conditions do not absorb information efficiently, consequentially it is an illusion to think that learning environments that do not consider motivational and emotional factors are adequate",Corroborating Emotion Theory with Role Theory and Agent Technology: a Framework for Designing Emotional Agents as Motivational Tutoring Entities,https://core.ac.uk/download/33799208.pdf,,,,core

480211410,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Credit card fraud jeopardizes the trust of customers in e-commerce transactions. This led in recent years to major advances in the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with short reaction time and high precision. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of the fraud behavior makes it difficult to tailor existing systems to different contexts (e.g. new payment systems, different countries and/or population segments). Given the high cost (research, prototype development, and implementation in production) of designing data-driven FDSs, it is crucial for transactional companies to define procedures able to adapt existing pipelines to new challenges. From an AI/machine learning perspective, this is known as the problem of transfer learning. This paper discusses the design and implementation of transfer learning approaches for e-commerce credit card fraud detection and their assessment in a real setting. The case study, based on a six-month dataset (more than 200 million e-commerce transactions) provided by the industrial partner, relates to the transfer of detection models developed for a European country to another country. In particular, we present and discuss 15 transfer learning techniques (ranging from naive baselines to state-of-the-art and new approaches), making a critical and quantitative comparison in terms of precision for different transfer scenarios. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we show that the accuracy of many transfer methods is strongly dependent on the number of labeled samples in the target domain and (ii) we propose an ensemble solution to this problem based on self-supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation classifiers. The thorough experimental assessment shows that this solution is both highly accurate and hardly sensitive to the number of labeled samples",Transfer Learning Strategies for Credit Card Fraud Detection,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104472,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core
395142086,2019-01-29T00:00:00,"[EN] Classification or typology systems used to categorize different human body parts have
existed for many years. Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features.
Ergonomics, forensic anthropology, crime prevention or new human-machine interaction
systems and online activities, like e-commerce, e-learning, games, dating or social networks, are fields in which classifications of facial features are useful, for example, to create
digital interlocutors that optimize the interactions between human and machines. However,
classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported
low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. This
work presents a computer-based procedure to automatically classify facial features based
on their global appearance. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgements from human observers, and facilitates the development of
taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained through this procedure are presented

’TIS SPRING
'Tis spring out on the farm I see,
A little colt, with nostrils wide;
A prancing leap in frolics gay,
Then snuggle close to his mother’s side.
The cattle graze in the pastures green,
Content with warmth, and food and ease;
A soft blue sky a halo makes,
Above the tops of the greening trees.
A mother partridge, wounded like,
Leads us away from hidden young;
A thousand winged minstrels hide,
And serenade in their own sweet tounge.
And I - forgotten wintry blasts,
The years of wind, and scanty rain;
Go out with beauty hungry heart,
And plant the flower beds again.
- Elma Helgason
WORK OF HEART
My friend wanted a personalized Easter egg.
She chose a chocolate egg and took it to the
booth the department store had set up for ""egg
writing"", but no one was there.
After we waited patiently for a while, a lady
hurried towards us, her coat thrown over her
arm. Handing me the coat, she asked Mary
what name she wanted on the egg, then
proceeded to decorate it. When she finished, we
thanked the lady for taking tie to do the egg even
though she was obviously on her way home. She
flashed us a mischievous grin. ""Oh I don't work
here. I just always wanted to do this.""

The Canadian Cancer Society has launched its annual campaign for funds.
Canvassers will be out in force during the month of April in
Magrath. When the cancer volunteer comes to your door, please give generously. Your donation is put to very good use, in support of patient services, educational programs and research. These ongoing year round services are expensive but vital. Your support is urgently needed.
TOGETHER WE CAN BEAT CANCER!
This year the co-ordinators for the canvass are Marie Stevenson 758­3540 and Mary Sallenbach 758-6839. Please call either of them if you are able to give a few hours of your time to canvass. Last year, 30 volunteers raised over $2400.00 in the Magrath/Welling area. A Job well done! Let's do it again!","Magrath Store News (March 30, 1994)",,J. A. Ririe,,,core
29194283,,"The financial industry is witnessing major changes. The financial enterprise is undergoing major business process renewal accompanied with the introduction of new technologies including electronic commerce; the financial market is shifting from an old to a new trading model that introduces major structural changes to the market and new roles for market participants; investment offers access to ever larger repositories of financial information and a wider choice of financial instruments to fulfill rising needs and expectations. In all these developments, there is a central role for human intelligence that can potentially influence the pattern of change and direct appropriate decisions in adapting to change. There is also a vital need for computer-based technology to support this human activity. 



The relation between human and computer activities in classical models for computer-based support is characterised by rigidity and framed patterns of interaction. The emphasis in such models is on automation, not only in respect of routine trading operations, but even of the role of market participants. An alternative culture is emerging through the use of advanced technologies incorporating databases, spreadsheets, virtual reality, multi-media and AI. There is an urgent need for a framework in which to unify the classical culture, in which mathematical financial modelling has a central place, with the emerging culture, where there is greater emphasis upon human interaction and experiential aspects of computer use. This thesis addresses the problem of developing software that takes into account the human factor, the integration of the social and technical aspects, human insight, the experiential and situated aspects, different viewpoints of analysis, a holistic rather than an abstract view of the domain of study, cognitive rather than operational activities, and group social interaction. The ultimate aspiration for this work is to transform the computer as it is used in finance from an advanced calculator to an 'instrument of mind'. 



Meeting the challenges of software support for finance is not only a matter of deployment, but also of software system development (SSD): this motivates our focus on the potential applications and prospects for an Empirical Modelling (EM) approach to SSD in finance. EM technology is a suite of principles, techniques, notations, and tools. EM is a form of situated modelling that involves the construction of artefacts that stand in a special relationship to the modeller's understanding and the situation. The modelling activity is rooted in observation and experiment, and exploits the key concepts of observables, dependencies and agency. The thesis extends the major findings of Sun (1999), in respect of the essential character of SSD, and its contextual and social aspects, by considering its particular application to the finance domain. 



The principles and qualities of EM as an approach to SSD are first introduced and illustrated with reference to a review of relevant existing models. The suitability of EM as a framework for SSD in finance is then discussed with reference to case studies drawn from the finance domain (the financial enterprise, the financial market, and investment).

328259578,2018-09-03T00:00:00,"Real estate needs to improve its adoption of disruptive technologies to move from traditional to smart real estate (SRE). This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology’s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders—consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries—and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers’ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers’ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets. The study, being the first to explore real estate technologies, is limited by the number of research publications on the SRE technologies that has been compensated through incorporation of online reports","A Systematic Review of Smart Real Estate Technology: Drivers of, and Barriers to, the Use of Digital Disruptive Technologies and Online Platforms",http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3142,'MDPI AG',10.3390/su10093142,,core

The definitive version was published in http://doi.org/10.1145/2871166[EN] The demand for more sophisticated Location-Based Services (LBS) in terms of applications variety and accuracy is tripling every year since the emergence of the smartphone a few years ago. Equally, smartphone manufacturers are mounting several wireless communication and localization technologies, inertial sensors as well as powerful processing capability, to cater to such LBS applications. A hybrid of wireless technologies is needed to provide seamless localization solutions and to improve accuracy, to reduce time to fix, and to reduce power consumption. The review of localization techniques/technologies of this emerging field is therefore important. This article reviews the recent research-oriented and commercial localization solutions on smartphones. The focus of this article is on the implementation challenges associated with utilizing these positioning solutions on Android-based smartphones. Furthermore, the taxonomy of smartphone-location techniques is highlighted with a special focus on the detail of each technique and its hybridization. The article compares the indoor localization techniques based on accuracy, utilized wireless technology, overhead, and localization technique used. The pursuit of achieving ubiquitous localization outdoors and indoors for critical LBS applications such as security and safety shall dominate future research efforts.This research was sponsored by Koya University, Kurdistan Region-Iraq.

demonstrated results that make them increasingly interesting for industrial
deployments. This paper explores the problem from an automation systems
point-of-view. We develop a robotics grasping system using Dex-Net, which is
fully integrated at the controller level. Two neural networks are deployed on a
novel industrial AI hardware acceleration module close to a PLC with a power
footprint of less than 10 W for the overall system. The software is tightly
integrated with the hardware allowing for fast and efficient data processing
and real-time communication. The success rate of grasping an object form a bin
is up to 95 percent with more than 350 picks per hour, if object and receptive
bins are in close proximity. The system was presented at the Hannover Fair 2019

In addition the secondary model predicts, if the customer is going to leave the e-commerce website in next few clicks. To answer this questions different frameworks are tested. The base model used is the Logit model. The base model is compared with more sophisticated methods in machine learning - with neural networks. The best results were yielded by Recurrent neural network - the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The results of the analysis confirm importance of the click stream data and calculated features that track user behavior on the e-commerce website, type of the page (product, category, information), product variance and category variance. The thesis emphasizes practical implications of this models. Two possible practical implementations are presented. The models are tested in novel ways to see how would they perform if implemented on the real e-commerce website.Tento článek analyzuje chování zákazníků na webových stránkách elektron- ického obchodu s cílem předpovědět, zda je zákazník ochoten si něco koupit nebo se jen dívá. Kromě toho sekundární model předpovídá, zda zákazník během několika málo kliknutí opustí web elektronického obchodu. Pro zod- povězení těchto otázek jsou testovány různé metody řešení. Použitý základní model je Logit. Základní model je porovnán se sofistikovanějšími metodami strojového učení - s neuronovými sítěmi. Nejlepší výsledky byly dosaženy po- mocí rekurentní neuronové sítě - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Výsledky analýzy potvrzují důležitost údajů o tocích kliknutí a napočtených proměnných, které sledují chování uživatelů na webové stránce elektronického obchodu, typ stránky (produkt, kategorie, informace), variance produktu a varianci kate- gorie.

475661028,,"The very small body of existing literature on content marketing consistently echoes the refrain that more research must be undertaken on the topic. My research, published since 2013, comprises the largest body of work on digital content marketing and content strategy. I have conducted and published more marketing-oriented research on digital content than anyone else in the field. Current literature examines content in narrow tranches, such as by platform or industry vertical. My research considers content as a practice, discipline, and strategic approach to marketing unto itself. This work provides an overview of digital marketing’s evolution and illustrates how it has diverged from initial expectations and offline corollaries: from advertising-centric marketing to new models in which advertising and media buying is either absent from the equation or constitutes a smaller proportion of strategy, which has shifted to owned and earned content models. My exploratory studies are collectively a holistic examination of content strategy and content marketing: creative and form factors, content’s intersection with other marketing forms, the evolution of technologies from publishing tools to more sophisticated applications of artificial intelligence (AI), Beacons, and sensors; the institutional and organisational challenges inherent in shifting organisations to become publishers and producers; and new forms of metrics and analytics. My research encompasses the following five areas: 1. People: How executives, employees, and consumers ideate, create, publish, amplify, and consume content. 2. Organisational Ecosystem: The roles played by brands, agencies, and technology vendors. 3. Technology: I have mapped and created a framework for content technology, assessing how content technology relates to and integrates with other marketing technologies as well as with enterprise software. 4. Strategy and Process: How content is conceived, created, disseminated, and functions within the paid, owned, and earned ecosystem as well as within the real- and near real-time enterprise demands. 5. Measurement: I developed a framework of ‘metrics that matter’ for content, relating content performance to enterprise strategy rather than the ‘soft metrics’ of likes and shares. Marketing that entertains, educates, informs, or provides utility meets consumer needs. This increases with the evolution of technology. Content (and marketing) now bleeds off screens and begins to permeate the physical world as everyday objects become ‘smart’ and imbued iii with content. Content is learning how to create itself, primarily via AI. My research scrutinises the implications of this evolution and content’s future state for consumers, brands, and businesses. Much of this work consists of firsts: the first research-based definitions of content marketing and content strategy; the first detailed study of content technologies and how they interrelate with other marketing and enterprise tools; the first research on native advertising and realtime marketing; the first research on where content resides within the enterprise (organisationally, globally, and interdepartmentally); and the first research on meaningful content measurement. While these areas are constantly evolving, my work provides the baselines and benchmarks to inform future research in the field","Content Marketing & Content Strategy: Identification of Research Trends, Best Practices, and Directions for Future Research",https://core.ac.uk/download/475661028.pdf,,,,core
159217765,2018-01-01T00:00:00,Different types of software components and data have to be combined to solve an artificial intelligence challenge. An emerging marketplace for these components will allow for their exchange and distribution. To facilitate and boost the collaboration on the marketplace a solution for finding compatible artifacts is needed. We propose a concept to define compatibility on such a marketplace and suggest appropriate scenarios on how users can interact with it to support the different types of required compatibility. We also propose an initial architecture that derives from and implements the compatibility principles and makes the scenarios feasible. We matured our concept in focus group workshops and interviews with potential marketplace users from industry and academia. The results demonstrate the applicability of the concept in a real-world scenario,Artifact Compatibility for Enabling Collaboration in the Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1007/978-3-030-04840-2_5,,core

An example of these technologies is Blockchain, which has appeared to overcome security problems potentially. This research assesses Blockchain\u27s implementation in supply chains through a methodology that uses deep learning and agent-based simulation. A case study was utilized to observe and validate research developments. The unique method predicts intrusions by using deep learning, and agent-based modeling reproduces artificial but convincing agents (e.g., customers, companies, hackers, and cyber pirates) in a computer-generated market. Trust and other relationships are systematically captured to represent Blockchain additions. Once again, the agent-based simulation model\u27s environment permits hypothetical interactions and emergent features by coordinating supply and demand for business-to-consumer e-commerce events.

6906130,,"We present a computational approach that autonomous software agents can adopt to make tactical decisions, such as product pricing, and strategic decisions, such as product mix and production planning, to maximize profit in markets with supply and demand uncertainties. Using a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques, the agent is able to characterize economic regimes, which are historical microeconomic conditions reflecting situations such as over-supply and scarcity. We assume an agent is capable of using real-time observable information to identify the current dominant market condition and we show how it can forecast regime changes over a planning horizon. We demonstrate how the agent can then use regime characterization to predict prices, price trends, and the probability of receiving a customer order in a dynamic supply chain environment. We validate our methods by presenting experimental results from a testbed derived from the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM). The results show that our agent outperforms traditional short- and long-term predictive methodologies (such as exponential smoothing) significantly, resulting in accurate prediction of customer order probabilities, and competitive market prices. This, in turn, has the potential to produce higher profits. We also demonstrate the versatility of our computational approach by applying the methodology to prediction of stock price trends.dynamic pricing;machine learning;agent-mediated electronic commerce;market forecasting;rational decision making",Tactical and Strategic Sales Management for Intelligent Agents Guided By Economic Regimes,,,,,core
483700440,2021-10-15T00:00:00,"As the world calls it, data is the new oil. With vast installments of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) infrastructure, data is produced at a rate like never before. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions are getting integrated to numerous services, making them ""smarter"". However, the data remains fragmented in individual organizational silos inhibiting data value extraction to it&#x2019;s full potential. Digital marketplaces are emerging to allow data owners to monetize this data. Yet concerns like privacy, security and unfair payment settlement deter adoption of such platforms. In addition, the state-of-the-art platforms are under the control of large multinational corporations with no transparency between buyer and seller in terms of payment details, listing, data discovery and storage. In this work, a novel decentralized platform of digital data marketplace for IoT data has been proposed. The platform leverages a decentralized data streaming network to host IoT data in a reliable and fault tolerant manner. The platform ensures fair trading, data storage and delivery in a privacy preserving manner and trust metric calculation for actors in the network. In order to study the feasibility of the proposed platform, an open source library is developed using Hyperledger Fabric and data network layer built on VerneMQ, the library is deployed on a real-time Google cloud platform.

475079083,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Last-mile operations in forward and reverse logistics are responsible for a large part of the costs, emissions, and times in supply chains. These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage",Data-Driven Methodology to Support Long-Lasting Logistics and Decision Making for Urban Last-Mile Operations,,'MDPI AG',10.3390/su13116230,"[{'title': 'Sustainability', 'identifiers': ['2071-1050', 'issn:2071-1050']}]",core
201801018,2018-09-01T00:00:00,"Real estate needs to improve its adoption of disruptive technologies to move from traditional to smart real estate (SRE). This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology&rsquo;s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders&mdash;consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries&mdash;and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers&rsquo; needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers&rsquo; needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets.

398561907,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Adoption of digital platform innovations afford a changing nature of work, from mobile computing platforms (e.g. Apple) enabling 24/7 work connectivity, to labour marketplace platforms (e.g. Uber) enabling precarious work arrangements. Recently, organisations are adopting/investigating spatial computing platforms (e.g. Autodesk, Toyota, BNP Paribas), offering new affordances for organising (e.g. carrying out tasks, communicating and collaborating). Spatial computing concerns achieving spatial interplay between the real and digital world (Agulhon 2016), enabling perception of physically present content. An emerging paradigm of spatial computing is enabled by hardware and software innovations for; 1) digitally mapping, tracking, understanding and predicting analog audio and visual spatial fields, 2) creating digital audio and visual spatial fields, and the (3) mixing and fusing of those fields. Mixed, augmented and immersive reality is then experienced by volumetric graphic rendering onto a human's field of view (FOV) (Martín-Gutiérrez et al. 2017). Emerging marketplace examples can be seen in 'Microsoft Hololens 2' and 'Magic Leap One' platforms, both creating/enabling an ecosystem of novel applications for both industrial, educational and leisure life contexts. With further convergence of IoT, haptics, 5G, cloud and AI etc., spatial applications will range from contextually aware and interactive; digital information layering of objects, guidance and decision support systems (DSS) within business operations (such as for industrial machine manufacture, monitoring, and maintenance), digital modelling & prototyping in R&D, through to applications for communications and collaborations (such as for spatial tele co-presence of people, objects and environments). More broadly, these advances have potential to catalyse disruptions within business, through to the labour and consumer marketplace via: (1) Virtualisation of hardware resources (e.g. fully digitising workplace equipment such as displays and interfaces, raw inputs for prototyping and even digital rendering of spaces). (2) Protection and strengthening of institutional knowledge and performance via knowledge capture, guidance and decision support of labour tasks and activity (e.g. reducing labour (re)training (e.g. parts assembly), knowledge capture of practice). (3) Creation and distribution of new value propositions in goods and services (e.g. digital item ownership in a mixed-reality cloud, spatial applications for IoT enabled devices). (4) Displacement of geographic space as cost, talent, time, access and convenience constraints on business (e.g. available talent pool, partner/customer reach and relations). (5) Collaboration through new/enhanced affordances for workers (e.g. shared digitised work tools/environments). Therefore, a paradigm of spatial computing will challenge the IS community to research new ways of working, and consequences for worker experience, meaning, productivity and power. With emerging advances in AI, automation and spatial computing, one of the pertinent enquires concerns importance of workers (sense of) agency (Chandra et al. 2019). Control in the IT context has been conceptualised as control over work, control over self, and control over technology (Beaudry and Pinsonneault 2005), with prior IS work studying locus of control related to; work stress (Chandra et al. 2019), intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Mujinga, M Eloff, MM Kroeze 2013), and performance (Vieira da Cunha et al. 2015) etc. With spatial computing platforms and their applications, what affordances of control and for whom should be developed? For example, the electronic representation of worker activity can be further enabled. Thus, tighter or looser coupling between worker activity and the reporting/outcome of work (Vieira da Cunha et al. 2015) becomes more of an organisational decision, with capability to monitor workers, and leverage AI for learning and optimisation. Furthermore, with development of spatial tele co-presence (STcP) (e.g. Mimesys), brings new affordances for communication with any worker(s), at any time, from anywhere. However, prior CMC research suggests people can choose different communication media specifically to manage social and emotional relationships (Madianou 2014) and their time (Mcloughlin et al. 2019). Hence, will such affordances serve greater identity fusion (Swann et al. 2012) and collaboration in organisations? Thus, we propose a socio-technical research agenda exploring 'control' related affordances for emerging spatial computing platforms, such as for STcP technology. In this regard, Control Theory can offer a useful starting frame, as it deals with control mechanisms governing workers organisational actions both formal (outcome and behaviour based) and informal (group and self-control), to further the interests of organisations (Kirsch 1996). We suggest, data and communication related affordances of control (e.g. privacy, exploitation, authenticity, availability and spaces) as starting points. Social Capital (Lin 2001), Social Influence (Kelman 1958), Social Identity (Ellemers and Haslam 2012), Identity Fusion (Swann et al. 2012) and Polymedia (Madianou and Miller 2012) being just some of the many relevant social theories to this endeavour",Affordances of Control in a Paradigm of Spatial Computing Platforms,,,,,core
275610953,2016-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] This paper presents the extension of a meta-model (MAM5) and a framework based on the model (JaCalIVE) for developing intelligent virtual environments. The goal of this extension is to develop augmented mirror worlds that represent a real and virtual world coupled, so that the virtual world not only reflects the real one, but also complements it. A new component called a smart resource artifact, that enables modelling and developing devices to access the real physical world, and a human in the loop agent to place a human in the system have been included in the meta-model and framework. The proposed extension of MAM5 has been tested by simulating a light control system where agents can access both virtual and real sensor/actuators through the smart resources developed. The results show that the use of real environment interactive elements (smart resource artifacts) in agent-based simulations allows to minimize the error between simulated and real system.This work is partially supported by the TIN2009-13839-C03-01, TIN2011-27652-C03-01, 547CSD2007-00022, COST Action IC0801, FP7-294931 and the FPI grant AP2013-01276 548 awarded to Jaime-Andres Rincon.Rincón Arango, JA.; Poza Luján, JL.; Julian Inglada, VJ.; Posadas Yagüe, JL.; Carrascosa Casamayor, C.

343439754,2017-03-01T00:00:00,"Frank Kendall, then Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, released the first defense acquisition system performance report in June 2013. This report focused primarily on performance related to the collective outcomes of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs), but additionally explored various descriptive dimensions and acquisition approaches of the same (Kendall, 2013). Each annual report builds on the work previously conducted, and focuses on data-driven analysis relying on statistical techniques to identify trends that improve the defense acquisition communityﾒs insights into how contract incentives are motivating better contractor/vendor performance (Kendal, 2016). Nevertheless, large amounts of data (in modern jargon, ﾓBig Dataﾔ) are now available for research in the area of defense acquisition. Over the past several years, changes in electronic commerce have increased the amounts of both structured and unstructured data availableﾗboth in runtime and archived environments. This electronic data, from a variety of different acquisition agencies, can be obtained by a variety of means and used for a multitude of purposes (Snider et al., 2014). Traditional statistical and trend analysis methods thus far have been primarily relied upon to explore trends and test metrics in the sets of acquisition data at hand. Sometimes, spreadsheets of linear regression correlation are employed, or, in some more modern applications, multivariate structural equation models via scientific applications such as SPSS and AMOS are leveraged for their ability to evaluate complex variable relationships, such as nested or recursive if-then patterns (Byrne, 2016). However, not only are todayﾒs modern datasets large in magnitude, they are also large in variety and complexity (Gartner, 2013). Furthermore, to address this state of data, new statistical modeling techniques, more powerful than before, have had to be created. This is due to the older methods finding difficulty with some of the size problems Big Data represents, such as privacy and security concerns (Parms, 2017). Thankfully, computer power necessary to employ the modern techniques is less expensive today, the software near free, and the storage capacities available now yield bewildering capacities at a fingertip, and with amazingly fast access speed. In fact, these performance parameters appear to continue along a Mooreﾒs trend line against critical opposition (Magee, Basnet, Funk, & Benson, 2015). Presently, one of the more interesting of the new statistical modeling techniques is neural network algorithm machine learning. Neural network modeling involves utilizing a ﾓpowerful computational data model that is able to capture and represent input/output relationships.ﾔ This model was developed out of the desire to create artificial intelligence systems capable of completing functions that were previously executed solely by the human brain. One benefit of using neural network modeling lies with its capacity to display and comprehend both linear and non-linear relationships from the data to which it is supplied (NeuroSolutions, 2015). Research Question Because ﾓBig Dataﾔ is present in the Defense Acquisition Business space, and, because the demand to critically understand real cause-and-effect relationships between variables within that data is persistent from the Acquisition community, this paperﾒs research question is, Can a neural network modeling technique be confidently relied upon to meaningfully explore variable relationships within acquisition business datasets? Because, if it is, then any question may be reasonably asked by anyone of such a dataset; and, via the neural network-enabled tool, the answers they receive will come with scientific statistical confidence as to whether they can be trusted as interesting or useful answers.1 In order to explore this research question, the study opted to use business data on contractor performance and attempted to isolate predictive variables from past performance information predictive of good performance.Naval Postgraduate School Acquisition Research Progra",Data Consolidation of Disparate Procurement Data Sources for Correlated Performance-Based Acquisition,https://core.ac.uk/download/343439754.pdf,"Monterey, California.

objectives on a micro-crowdsourcing marketplace - the quality of work, total
cost incurred, and time to completion. Previous control agents have mostly
focused on cost-quality, or cost-time tradeoffs, but not on directly
controlling all three in concert. A naive formulation of three-objective
optimization is intractable; Octopus takes a hierarchical POMDP approach, with
three different components responsible for setting the pay per task, selecting
the next task, and controlling task-level quality. We demonstrate that Octopus
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on real
experiments. We also deploy Octopus on Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing its
ability to manage tasks in a real-world dynamic setting.Comment: 10 pages, to appear in HCOMP 201",Octopus: A Framework for Cost-Quality-Time Optimization in Crowdsourcing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03488,,,,core
209828433,2002-10-31,"AbstractOver recent years, the notion of agency has claimed a major role in defining the trends of modern research. Influencing a broad spectrum of disciplines such as Sociology, Psychology, among others, the agent paradigm virtually invaded every sub-field of Computer Science, not least because of the Internet and Robotics.Multi-agent Systems (MAS) are communities of problem-solving entities that can perceive and act upon their environments to achieve their individual goals as well as joint goals. The work on such systems integrates many technologies and concepts in artificial intelligence and other areas of computing. There is a full spectrum of MAS applications that have been and are being developed; from search engines to educational aids to electronic commerce and trade.Although commonly implemented by means of imperative languages, mainly for reasons of efficiency, the agent concept has recently increased its influence in the research and development of computational logic based systems.Computational Logic, by virtue of its nature both in substance and method, provides a well-defined, general, and rigorous framework for systematically studying computation, be it syntax, semantics, procedures, or attending implementations, environments, tools, and standards. Computational Logic approaches problems, and provides solutions, at a sufficient level of abstraction so that they generalise from problem domain to problem domain, afforded by the nature of its very foundation in logic, both in substance and method, which constitutes one of its major assets.The purpose of this workshop is to discuss techniques, based on computational logic, for representing, programming and reasoning about multi-agent systems in a formal way. This is clearly a major challenge for computational logic, to deal with real world issues and applications.The first workshop in this series took place in Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA, in 1999, under the designation Multi-Agent Systems in Logic Programming (MASLP'99), and affiliated with ICLP'99. In the following year, the name of the workshop changed to Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems (CLIMA'00), taking place in London, UK, and affiliated with CL'2000. The subsequent edition, CLIMA'01, took place in Paphos, Cyprus, affiliated with ICLP'01. The present edition, CLIMA'02, takes place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on August the1st of 2002, and is affiliated with ICLP'02 and part of FLOC'02.We would like to thank the authors of the submitted papers, the members of the program committee and the additional reviewers for their contribution to both the meeting and this volume. We would also like to thank Michael Mislove for his help with the editing of the proceedings.Programme Committee

There follows a brief overview of the workshop.Session 1 - Agents: Arguments and UpdatesSchroeder and Schweimeier present a framework based on logic programming with 3-valued multi-agent argumentation and fuzzy unification, for knowledge representation and reasoning in agents, to accommodate arguments for negotiating agents when agent communication is subject to uncertainty.Leite et al. extend the language LUPS introducing MLUPS, an update command language designed for specifying the flexible evolution of hierarchically related groups of agents, based on logic programming, thus assigning them declarative semantics.Kakas and Moraïtis present a modular argumentation framework for modelling agent deliberation, where object level arguments can be made conditional on agents' roles and the priority relation amongst such roles can, in turn, be made conditional on contents, on top of which a simple form of abduction allows dealing with incomplete knowledge.Session 2 - Logics for AgentsToyama et al. introduce a translation of multi-agent autoepistemic logic (MAEL), a logic for multi-agent systems based on Moore's autoepistemic logic, into logic programming, and show the correspondence between MAEL extensions and the stable models of the corresponding logic program.Dell'Acqua et al. extend their previous work on abductive logic programming based multi-agent systems, in which agents can update themselves and each other, eliminate contradictory update rules, abduce hypotheses to explain observations, and use them to generate actions, with asynchronous based communication through the use of buffers.Harland and Winikoff discuss the formalisation and implementation issues of BDI-type agents, using a Linear Logic based calculus that allows a mixture of forward- and backward-chaining techniques.Session 3 - BDI Agent SystemsBordini and Moreira investigate how far the Asymmetry Thesis Principles formulated by Rao and Georgeff are actually met by the abstract agent specification language AgentSpeak(L), hence contributing to the reconciliationBetween practice and theory of BDI-based agents.Araragi et al. formalise and propose a method to solve a verification problem that arises in implementing a commitment strategy for the BDI architecture, namely the verification of the suitability and/or feasibility of the intentions of an agent.Nide et al. extend with mental state consistency features their previously presented deduction system for CTL-based propositional BDI Logics using sequent calculus, as a step towards the use of the expressive power of BDI Logics as executable specification languages of rational agents.Session 4 - Agents: Speculative Computation and IntrospectionHayashi et al. address the issue of integrating speculative computation and action execution through logic programming, namely by devising a method for plan modification when speculative computation fails or actions are executed.Iwanuma and Inoue refine the first-order consequence-finding procedure based on clausal tableaux SOL, with conditional answer computation and skip-preference, to formalise speculative computation in a master-slave multi-agent system.Bolander investigates on finding consistent classes of formulas under the syntactical treatment of knowledge and belief, identifying three maximal sets of introspective beliefs that strong introspective agents can consistently maintain so as to avoid the paradoxes of self-reference.Session 5 - Panel DiscussionTorroni moderates a panel discussion entitled ""Logics and Multi-agents: towards a new symbolic model of cognition"".This volume constitutes the proceedings of CLIMA'02.September 2002, Jürgen Dix, João Alexandre Leite and Ken Satoh (Guest Editors",Preface ,,Published by Elsevier B.V.,10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80598-5,,core
398227078,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Adoption of digital platform innovations afford a changing nature of work, from mobile computing platforms (e.g. Apple) enabling 24/7 work connectivity, to labour marketplace platforms (e.g. Uber) enabling precarious work arrangements. Recently, organisations are adopting/investigating spatial computing platforms (e.g. Autodesk, Toyota, BNP Paribas), offering new affordances for organising (e.g. carrying out tasks, communicating and collaborating). Spatial computing concerns achieving spatial interplay between the real and digital world (Agulhon 2016), enabling perception of physically present content. An emerging paradigm of spatial computing is enabled by hardware and software innovations for; 1) digitally mapping, tracking, understanding and predicting analog audio and visual spatial fields, 2) creating digital audio and visual spatial fields, and the (3) mixing and fusing of those fields. Mixed, augmented and immersive reality is then experienced by volumetric graphic rendering onto a human's field of view (FOV) (Martín-Gutiérrez et al. 2017). Emerging marketplace examples can be seen in 'Microsoft Hololens 2' and 'Magic Leap One' platforms, both creating/enabling an ecosystem of novel applications for both industrial, educational and leisure life contexts. With further convergence of IoT, haptics, 5G, cloud and AI etc., spatial applications will range from contextually aware and interactive; digital information layering of objects, guidance and decision support systems (DSS) within business operations (such as for industrial machine manufacture, monitoring, and maintenance), digital modelling & prototyping in R&D, through to applications for communications and collaborations (such as for spatial tele co-presence of people, objects and environments). More broadly, these advances have potential to catalyse disruptions within business, through to the labour and consumer marketplace via: (1) Virtualisation of hardware resources (e.g. fully digitising workplace equipment such as displays and interfaces, raw inputs for prototyping and even digital rendering of spaces). (2) Protection and strengthening of institutional knowledge and performance via knowledge capture, guidance and decision support of labour tasks and activity (e.g. reducing labour (re)training (e.g. parts assembly), knowledge capture of practice). (3) Creation and distribution of new value propositions in goods and services (e.g. digital item ownership in a mixed-reality cloud, spatial applications for IoT enabled devices). (4) Displacement of geographic space as cost, talent, time, access and convenience constraints on business (e.g. available talent pool, partner/customer reach and relations). (5) Collaboration through new/enhanced affordances for workers (e.g. shared digitised work tools/environments). Therefore, a paradigm of spatial computing will challenge the IS community to research new ways of working, and consequences for worker experience, meaning, productivity and power. With emerging advances in AI, automation and spatial computing, one of the pertinent enquires concerns importance of workers (sense of) agency (Chandra et al. 2019). Control in the IT context has been conceptualised as control over work, control over self, and control over technology (Beaudry and Pinsonneault 2005), with prior IS work studying locus of control related to; work stress (Chandra et al. 2019), intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Mujinga, M Eloff, MM Kroeze 2013), and performance (Vieira da Cunha et al. 2015) etc. With spatial computing platforms and their applications, what affordances of control and for whom should be developed? For example, the electronic representation of worker activity can be further enabled. Thus, tighter or looser coupling between worker activity and the reporting/outcome of work (Vieira da Cunha et al. 2015) becomes more of an organisational decision, with capability to monitor workers, and leverage AI for learning and optimisation. Furthermore, with development of spatial tele co-presence (STcP) (e.g. Mimesys), brings new affordances for communication with any worker(s), at any time, from anywhere. However, prior CMC research suggests people can choose different communication media specifically to manage social and emotional relationships (Madianou 2014) and their time (Mcloughlin et al. 2019). Hence, will such affordances serve greater identity fusion (Swann et al. 2012) and collaboration in organisations? Thus, we propose a socio-technical research agenda exploring 'control' related affordances for emerging spatial computing platforms, such as for STcP technology. In this regard, Control Theory can offer a useful starting frame, as it deals with control mechanisms governing workers organisational actions both formal (outcome and behaviour based) and informal (group and self-control), to further the interests of organisations (Kirsch 1996). We suggest, data and communication related affordances of control (e.g. privacy, exploitation, authenticity, availability and spaces) as starting points. Social Capital (Lin 2001), Social Influence (Kelman 1958), Social Identity (Ellemers and Haslam 2012), Identity Fusion (Swann et al. 2012) and Polymedia (Madianou and Miller 2012) being just some of the many relevant social theories to this endeavour",Affordances of Control in a Paradigm of Spatial Computing Platforms,https://core.ac.uk/download/398227078.pdf,,,,core

428380032,2017-05-01T07:00:00,"Report from a meeting held on the topic of disinformation, the Internet, and public diplomacy held at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, in 2017.
Executive Summary
Scientific progress continues to accelerate, and while we’ve witnessed a revolution in communication technologies in the past ten years, what proceeds in the next ten years may be far more transformative. It may also be extremely disruptive, challenging long held conventions behind public diplomacy (PD) programs and strategies. In order to think carefully about PD in this ever and rapidly changing communications space, the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy (ACPD) convened a group of private sector, government, and academic experts at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution to discuss the latest trends in research on strategic communication in digital spaces. The results of that workshop, refined by a number of follow-on interviews and discussions, are included in this report. I encourage you to read each of the fourteen essays that follow, which are divided into three thematic sections: Digital’s Dark Side, Disinformation, and Narratives.
Digital’s Dark Side focuses on the emergence of social bots, artificial intelligence, and computational propaganda. Essays in this section aim to raise awareness regarding how technology is transforming the nature of digital communication, offer ideas for competing in this space, and raise a number of important policy and research questions needing immediate attention. The Disinformation section confronts Oxford English Dictionary’s 2016 word of the year – “post-truth” – with a series of compelling essays from practitioners, a social scientist, and philosopher on the essential roles that truth and facts play in a democratic society. Here, theory, research, and practice neatly align, suggesting it is both crucial and effective to double-down on fact-checking and evidence-based news and information programming in order to combat disinformation campaigns from our adversaries. The Narrative section concludes the report by focusing on how technology and facts are ultimately part of, and dependent on, strategic narratives. Better understanding how these narratives form, and what predicts their likely success, is necessary to think through precisely how PD can, indeed, survive the Internet. Below are some key takeaways from the report.
In Defense of Truth
• We are not living in a “post-truth” society. Every generation tends to think that the current generation is less honest than the previous generation. This is an old human concern, and should be seen today as a strategic narrative (see Hancock, p. 49; Roselle, p. 77). Defending the value and search for truth is crucial. As Jason Stanley notes (p. 71), “without truth, there is just power.”
• Humans are remarkably bad at detecting deception. Studies show that people tend to trust what others say, an effect called the truth bias. This bias is actually quite rational—most of the messages that a person encounters in a day are honest, so being biased toward the truth is almost always the correct response (see Hancock, p.49).
• At the same time people are also continuously evaluating the validity of their understanding of the world. This process is called “epistemic vigilance,” a continuous process checking that the information that a person believes they know about the world is accurate. While we have a difficult time detecting deception from interpersonal cues, people can detect lies when they have the time, resources, and motivation. Lies are often discovered through contradicting information from a third source, or evidence that challenges a deceptive account (see Hancock, p. 49).
• Fact checking can be effective, even in hyper-partisan settings (see Porter, p. 55), and is crucial for sustained democratic dialogue (Bennett, p. 61; Stanley, p. 71). Moreover, it is possible, using digital tools, to detect and effectively combat disinformation campaigns in real time (Henick and Walsh, p. 65).
Computational Propaganda
• Computational propaganda refers to the coordinated use of social media platforms, autonomous agents and big data directed towards the manipulation of public opinion.
• Social media bots (or “web robots”) are the primary tools used in the dissemination of computational propaganda. In their most basic form, bots provide basic answers to simple questions, publish content on a schedule or disseminate stories in response to triggers (e.g. breaking news). Bots can have a disproportionate impact because it is easy to create a lot of them and they can post a high-volume content at a high frequency (see Woolley, p.13).
• Political bots aim to automate political engagement in an attempt to manipulate public opinions. They allow for massive amplification of political views and can empower a small group of people to set conversation agenda’s online. Political bots are used over social media to manufacture trends, game hashtags, megaphone particular content, spam opposition and attack journalists. The noise, spam and manipulation inherent in many bot deployment techniques threaten to disrupt civic conversations and organization worldwide (see Chessen, p.19).
• Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) – an evolving constellation of technologies enabling computers to simulate cognitive processes – will soon enable highly persuasive machine-generated communications. Imagine an automated system that uses the mass of online data to infer your personality, political preferences, religious affiliation, demographic data and interests. It knows which news websites and social media platforms you frequent and it controls multiple user accounts on those platforms. The system dynamically creates content specifically designed to plug into your particular psychological frame and achieve a particular outcome (see Chessen, p. 39).
• Digital tools have tremendous advantages over humans. Once an organization creates and configures a sophisticated AI bot, the marginal cost of running it on thousands or millions of user accounts is relatively low. They can operate 24/7/365 and respond to events almost immediately. AI bots can be programmed to react to certain events and create content at machine speed, shaping the narrative almost immediately. This is critical in an information environment where the first story to circulate may be the only one that people recall, even if it is untrue (see Chessen, p. 39).
• PD practitioners need to consider the question of how they can create and sustain meaningful conversations and engagements with audiences if the mediums typically relied upon are becoming less trusted, compromised and dominated by intelligent machines.
• Challenging computational propaganda should include efforts to ensure the robustness and integrity of the marketplace of information online. Defensively, this strategy would focus on producing patterns of information exchange among groups that would make them difficult to sway using techniques of computational propaganda. Offensively, the strategy would seek to distribute the costs of counter-messaging broadly, shaping the social ecosystem to enable alternative voices to effectively challenge campaigns of misinformation (see Hwang, p. 27). In the persuasive landscape formed by social media and computational propaganda, it may be at times more effective to build tools, rather than construct a specific message.
• Practitioners are not alone in their concern about the escalating use of social bots by adversarial state actors. The private sector is, too. Social media platforms see this trend as a potentially existential threat to their business models, especially if the rise of bots and computational propaganda weakens users’ trust in the integrity of the platforms themselves. Coordination with private sector is key, as their policies governing autonomous bots will adapt and, thus, shape what is and isn’t feasible online.
Moving Past Folk Theories
• Folk theories, or how people think a particular process works, are driving far too many digital strategies. One example of a folk theory is in the prevalence of echo chambers online, or the idea that people are increasingly digitally walled off from one another, engaging only with content that fits cognitive predispositions and preferences.
• Research suggests that the more users rely on digital platforms (e.g. Twitter and Facebook) for their news and information, the more exposure they have to a multitude of sources and stories. This remains true even among partisans (though to a lesser extent than non-partisans). It turns out we haven’t digitally walled ourselves off after all (see Henick and Walsh, p. 65).
• Despite increased exposure to a pluralistic media ecosystem, we are becoming more and more ideological and partisan, and becoming more walled off at the interpersonal and physical layers. For example, marriages today are twice as likely to be between two people with similar political views than they were in 1960.
• Understanding this gap between a robustly diverse news environment and an increasingly “siloed” physical environment is crucial to more effectively engaging with target audiences around the world. Interpersonal and in-person engagement, including exchange programs, remain crucial for effective PD moving forward (see Wharton, p. 7).
• Despite this growing ideological divide, people are increasingly willing to trust one another, even complete strangers, when their goals are aligned (see the sharing economy, for example). This creates interesting opportunities for PD practitioners. Targeting strategies based on political attitudes or profiles may overshadow the possibility of aligned goals on important policy and social issues (see Hancock, p. 49).
Rethinking Our Digital Platforms and Metrics
Virality – the crown jewel in the social media realm – is overemphasized often at the expense of more important metrics like context and longevity. Many of the metrics used to measure the effectiveness of social media campaigns are vulnerable to manipulation, and more importantly, don’t measure engagement in any meaningful way. These metrics were built for an industry reliant on advertising for revenue generation, and as a result, may not be well-suited when applied to the context of PD (see Ford, p. 33; Woolley, p. 13).
• Overemphasizing certain metrics, such as reach or impressions, fails to account for the risks created by relaying on the same portals as other, less truthful and more nefarious actors. We need to be cautious and aware of the various ways in which the digital media business industries are shaping PD content, be aware of the risks, and think carefully about safeguarding the credibility U.S. Department of State PD programs operating in this space (see Wharton, p. 7; Ford, p. 33).
Strategic Narratives
• Strategic narratives—a means for political actors to construct a shared meaning of the past, present and future of politics in order to shape the behavior of other actors.” They provide the ideological backdrop for how audiences assess the meaning and significance of current events and breaking news. Put another way, they help people make sense of what would otherwise be a dizzying onslaught of news they are exposed to on a daily basis (see Roselle, p. 77; Kounalakis, p. 91).
• Crafting effective narratives require a genuine consensus--even if limited or temporary--on our policy priorities and their underlying values, as well as a detailed understanding and appreciation of local grievances and concerns about the related policy issue (see Wharton, p. 7; Roselle. P. 77). As such, effective strategic narratives must be mutually constructed.
• Rather than focusing on trending news topics and stories alone, we need to develop greater capacity to understand competing public narratives in foreign contexts and track how they adapt over time. Understanding distinctions between system (or governance), value, and identity narratives would allow PD practitioners to construct policy narratives that speak to, or at least acknowledge, the underlying pillars of belief in a given community (see Walker, p. 83; Roselle, p. 77).
• Every new administration creates new opportunities for foreign engagement. A shift towards a more transactional approach to PD, focused less on values but more on shared policy priorities, could allow for improved relations and cooperation with a number of countries previously hostile to American PD efforts and programs (see Kounalakis, p. 91)","Can Public Diplomacy Survive the Internet?

478159177,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Real estate needs to improve its adoption of disruptive technologies to move from traditional to smart real estate (SRE). This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology’s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders—consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries—and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers’ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers’ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders.

296662864,2015-11-26T15:38:18Z,"This paper suggests a multiagent system (MAS) approach for market simulation. This is achieved through analysis, modeling, implementation and simulation of artificial markets populated by software agents that represent economic self interested agents. Software agents are the constructs of a complex system, an artificial market that model a real existing market or an outline of a market design. The interest in simulating a market is multiple: exploiting existing market rules, searching for market design flaws and loopholes, and supporting decision making during a market mechanism design process. The main aim of the suggested approach is to analyze the behavior that emerges from the interaction of self interested agents acting in an artificial market. AEMAS (Artificial Economy MultiAgent System), a multiagent system architecture inspired by the Market Oriented Programming (MOP) approach is defined. In different economical sectors, e.g. energy markets, there is no consensus about which structures lead to social welfare maximization outcomes. An approach to find adequate architectures allows different market structure instances to be created and simulated, to ease the design and analysis of alternative structures. These alternatives can then be compared and potential design flaws eventually risen by simulation identified. Taking the electricity market as an example, two instances of the proposed architecture are presented, corresponding to the centralized dispatch arrangement common to non restructured markets, and the auction based pool, common to restructured markets.

practice, recommender system can greatly influence user behavior by promoting

into account user interaction with recommended items. We propose and evaluate

We present the problem of automatic co-niching in which potential suppliers of some product or service need to determine which offers to make to the marketplace at the same time as potential buyers need to determine which offers (if any) to purchase. Because both groups typically face incomplete or uncertain information needed for these decisions, participants in repeated market interactions engage in a learning process, making tentative decisions and adjusting these in the light of experiences they gain. Perhaps surprisingly, real markets typically then exhibit a form of parallel clustering: buyers cluster into segments of similar preferences and buyers into segments of similar offers. For computer scientists, the interesting question is whether such co-niching behaviours can be automated. We report on the first simulation experiments showing automated co-niching is possible using reinforcement learning in a multi-attribute product model. The work is of relevance to designers of online marketplaces, of computational resource allocation systems, and of automated software trading agents.

A common feature of all these professions is the digital nature of their activities. The project is aimed at these professions. In addition, it responds to the following processes that shape modern business and to which SMEs need to adapt:
1) The shift of trade to the web - the rapid growth of e-commerce - the coronovirus epidemic accelerated the global trend that was taking place anyway as part of the technological revolution known as Industry 4.0 - companies that have not yet moved their activities online are losing their competitiveness faster and faster and they will soon be unable to cope with the competition.
2) Automating customer service by introducing chatbots. With resource constraints, the smart way to get things done is through automation.
3) Generation Z has become the greatest market force, understanding the market completely differently and displaying consumer behaviour in a completely different way than previous generations. This creates a demand for new marketing strategies, new tools and new skills, as well as for new content that must be more visual and saturated with deeper content than before - refer not only to the substantive content of the message, but also for an attractive and visual message.
4) Moving business processes to the cloud - companies implementing the cloud have many benefits from improving processes, and at the same time cloud solutions are advanced, inexpensive, and easy to use.

heasants Forever
Alarmed by a continuing decline
in pheasant numbers, a local group
has decided to take action.
A couple of years ago, they have
formed a southern Alberta chapter of
Pheasants Forever, a group that boasts
about 100,000 members in North
America, mostly in the United States.
Chapters have also been established in
Medicine Hat, Brooks and Calgary.
The aim of the group is to pre­serve
habitat for the pheasants in the
south, says one of eight local board
members, Brent Ehlert.
Magrath has always been one of
the best spots for pheasant hunting in
southern Alberta, he says. The bird
isn’t native to the area though, he
explains, and it requires healthy envi­ronment
for it to survive year round.
Unfortunately that habitat has
been disappearing at an alarming rate,
he says.
Fence lines, ditches, tree stands
and other kinds of cover have been
erased as farmers seek to take advan­tage
of as much land as possible for
growing crops.
The decline of the species was
initially sparked in the 60s when there
was an open season on hens.
“That was the beginning of the
end. You can’t kill the female of the
Brent Ehlert ofMagrath, showing the protected habitat at the Deerfield Colony north of town.
species and expect them to survive.”
So far the group’s efforts have
focused on keeping the habitat that is
currently available, rather than creating
new spots.
The group is receiving a lot of
support, says Ehlert and has had a lot
of success in various —
areas in the two years it
has been operating. It has received
support and has worked with other
groups like Ducks Unlimited, Alberta
Conservation, irrigation districts and
Hutterite Colonies.
The group’s major fundraiser is a
banquet held in Lethbridge every
September, where they have raised over
$60,000 each of the last two years. The
money raised goes toward buying trees
and
shrubs or trucking them, fencing off areas and last year the
group funded a summer employee with St. Mary’s Irrigation.
“We are making headway,’’ says Ehlert. “We rely on
the farmers and ranchers to help us out.” He finds many of
them have been very cooperative.
“If you have the habitat, everything else comes -
pheasants, song birds, deer...” he says.
He points out that last year’s hunting season from mid­October
to mid-November was one of the best in recent
years, although nobody knows why for sure.
“But we know that the pheasants can still be here if we
can maintain and keep the habitat we have.”
At the present time, the group has about six habitats
they are working with in southern Alberta.
Those wanting more information or wanting to join
Pheasants Forever can phone (403) 758-3712 to get more
details.
“We just want to have something for the young person
growing up so pheasant hunting doesn’t become a lost art,”
says Ehlert. ♦

Water Tennis Anyone?
Saturday morning, January 10th, residents of Magrath
living in the south end of town gazed out on a newly formed
lake that covered the tennis courts and surrounding area.
About 8:00 am that morning, the town crew arrived on the
scene to see water flowing out of the doorway of the old
pump house that was a part of the original water system for
the town.
Sometime in the middle of the night, an old 4 inch steel
elbow pipe ruptured in the pumphouse’s basement. The 10
foot deep basement was soon filled and water began to flow
outside, covering the tennis court and surrounding area.
Eventually the two shut off valves were located and
turned off. At about 10:00 am the fire department began
pumping the basement and by about 3:30 pm there was still
three feet of water in the building.
It was about 9:30 pm when the fire department com­pleted
their job. ♦

The long anticipated day of the new high school offices
being completed has arrived. Moving took place this past
weekend as high school records, equipment and furniture
were moved to the newly renovated area in the hall north of
the main Tom Karren Gym entrance.
There is now office space for all the administrative
staff. With the extra room comes not only more work sta­tions
but more storage room and as Ila Ehlert, the high
school secretary says, “We can keep things more organized.”
“The advantage of having the two offices separated
(Elementary and Jr/Sr High School) is the work loads have
increased over the last few years to the point that it’s very
difficult to try and keep track of both schools,” Ehlert says.
We’ll be able to operate much more efficiently because we’ll
be focusing on our school.” The workload increase is partly
due to keeping closer track of attendance and more fundraising.
Hours of operation for the Magrath Jr/Sr High School
are the same as before, 8:00 am - 4:30 pm, but right now
they’re closing during lunch, 11:45 am -12:45 pm.
The elementary school’s hours are: 8:15 am - 3:45 pm,
also closing for the lunch hour, 11:45 am -12:45 pm. ❖

The Alberta Government has passed
bill 53 AUTOMOBILE RATE FREEZE. This freeze
applies to all mandatory and optional insurance for
all classes of vehicles and is effective on or after
October 30,2003. This freeze is in effect for 18 months.
Any renewals that wrere issued with a premium
increase on or after Oct. 30th will be issued a credit.
Renewals issued after Feb. 2004 will have it’s premium
froze to last years rates.
PLEASE NOTE BILL 53
WILL INCREASE YOUR PREMIUMS
IF ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OCCURS.
1. An at fault accident.
2. Convicted of a criminal offense relating
to operation of an automobile.
3. Buy a new vehicle.
4. Change of address.
5. Add an additional driver to your policy.
The government is trying to come up with a new
insurance policy that all drivers will pay the same
base premium. Therefore no AGE, SEX, MARITAL
STATUS OR TERRITORY DISCRIMINATION.
So the 16 year old male living in Calgary will pay the
same base rate as a married 50 year old in Magrath
or rural area. You hear “them” saying government
insurance is cheaper in B.C. or Sask. And “they’re”
right if you are under age, single, have an impaired,
tickets or accidents. The average “Joe’s” premium is
still cheaper in Alberta. With Government insurance
the average “Joe” subsidizes the higher risks.

Seeing Things in a
Whole New Light
By Rick Humphreys
Jake Loose- owner of
Apex Thermal Imaging.
Do you worry that
your home may not be well
insulated? Do you suspect
that you may be losing heat
but don’t know where it is
leakingout? Or are you
concerned that you may
have wiring problems that
could eventually result in a
fire?
There is a new busi­ness
in town that can help
you find answers to these
questions. Apex Thermal
Imaging, owned and oper-ated
by Jacob (Jake) Loose, uses infrared photographic
technology to help you literally see the sources of your
problems.
Infrared energy is light that is not visible to the human
eye. It's the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we
perceive as heat. Specialized equipment, such as night
vision goggles and infrared cameras are able to “see” this
type of light and
convert it into
images that we can
see.

utilize the camera and interpret the resulting images.
In a typical home heat loss investigation, Jake will go
to the home at night and take multiple exterior and interior
infrared pictures. After downloading the images to a
computer, using specialized software, he creates a report
which includes images and data which provide the heat loss
information. Lastly, he delivers the report to the customer
and helps them understand where and how much heat is
being lost.
Heat loss is a comfort and economical problem, but
faulty electrical wiring is the cause of many fires. Infrared
images of walls and electrical panels will show any existing
heat spots, indicating that there may be a problem with
wiring in those locations.
Infrared imaging can assist in many business applica­tions.
By imaging flat roofs on large buildings, the pictures
can pinpoint specific locations of leaks. The company can
then fix localized problems, rather than replacing the entire
roof covering.
Images of mechanical equipment can show where
there is undesired heat build-up, indicating worn or failing
parts such as bearings. This helps the business do proper
preventative maintenance to keep expensive equipment up
and running.
Jake is excited about this technology and how it can
provide the first step for people to make their homes and
businesses more comfortable, economical and safe. For
further information, you can call Apex Thermal Imaging at

(story continued from last weeks issue)
That's one of the marvels of prospecting lunacy, getting
into places you have no business getting into. All the laws of
physics and probability just go right out the window. But not
the law of gravity... oh no, it has an iron, tenacious grip on
reality.
Well now, I had to get back down, because I certainly
couldn't go up. You can't climb a boulder clay cliff, no mat-ter
how high on prospecting, or any other heady stimulant,
you are. So, I took my first step down.
It actually wasn't so bad. I just leaned back into the hill
and put all my weight on that still-squishy boot heel.
Miraculously, it held, and I took another step. The bucket of
gravel felt like it must surely be mostly gold! Or, I was just an
idiot that had severely overloaded it, but no matter; this was
easier than I thought. I was now in amongst the smaller
boulders, the ones that had dogged me on the way up.
I took several more steps and then one of those lurking
tree branches snagged my boot. That bucket just kicked out
in front of me like it was on rocket-assisted autopilot. Well,
Newton sure was right about gravity—it grabbed me right then
and there. I don't know the mathematical formula for what
happened, or the principle of physics that took over, but it all
took place at about
the speed of light.
My brain franti­cally
went into disas­ter
salvation correc­tion
mode, and I
promptly, yet grace­fully
yanked myself
back as hard as I
could, bringing the bucket toward me. The problem was that
my feet had already headed down the mountain, and all I did
with my serene corrective maneuver was succeed in launch­ing
both feet further away from my point of most-precarious
equilibrium.
At a distance, say from the other side of the canyon, I'm
sure it looked like someone had shot something up on the
side of the mountain: some ugly beast, a raging bull moose,
or some other type of smelly obnoxious varmint (any of
which category I easily qualify for after three glorious weeks
in the bush), but nonetheless, it must have appeared that
some tortured, wracked savage form, thrashing out its death­throes,
was hurtling its way down the slope.
The real truth is that I was magnificently in control,
supremely in command. The fact that my rubber boots were
throwing off more smoke than a good smudge fire was only

my clever attempt to keep the bugs at bay as I tried to find my
brakes amongst the boulders. The feet that the three spare
gold pans in my backpack were absorbing more shock than
a crash-test-dummy doing macli V into a concrete wall was
only a minor annoyance, a brief test of my prospecting mettle.
At last, much more battered, but still breathing (though
hot and ragged those breaths were, I can tell you), I came to
a sudden stop. In fact, it just so happened that some far
friendlier branches, much more amiable than the evil one
that had originally tripped me up, had halted my avalanching,
yet quite ballet-like, plunge.
For those with a sense of the divine in nature, this was
the penultimate moment—the human at one with the moun­tain—
still alive. Yet, most remarkable of all, none of the dirt
had spilled from my bucket. Yes, that is the true heroism in
this high placer tale— not a stone lost from the bucket, not
one grain of sand!
Rearranging all my joints took considerably longer
than I thought it should have, but soon with all parts more
or less functioning, I was on my way again, with renewed
confidence in my abilities. This time it was only boulder clay,
quite laid out like a sinister lava flow, but boulder clay
nonetheless.
Remember, I had steps carved in it to safely guide my
footsteps back down again. At some point, you'd think the
brain would revolt and refuse to command the muscles in an
instance like this, where the whole body has just faced immi­nent
extinction at the hands of an ambitious idiot bent on
sampling some dirt, but no, the brain can always be overrid­den.
I know where the master switch to disarm it is. I've used
it many times, and sb’ll, I live to tell this tale. This is proof
that life is full of mysteries, not easily solved by rational
thought, or by overly predictable theories.
At any rate, about a dozen steps down, the clay remem­bered
one of its admirable qualities, the slipperier-than-
Teflon one, and off I went again. This time it was only a gentle,
yet thorough pummeling and bashing that lasted a mere
twenty feet, and I came to a feather-like stop on the gravel
below, the contents of the bucket still serenely undisturbed.
After I picked a pan full of golf ball-sized gravel out of
my teeth, replaced my left eyeball, and checked to see
whether the protrusion from my shoulders really was my
neck and that it was still attached to my head, so that ","Magrath Store News (January 14, 2004)",,J. A. Ririe,,,core
1508061,2004-07-06T00:00:00,"Bargaining is becoming increasingly important due to developments within the field of electronic commerce, especially the development of autonomous software agents. Software agents are programs which, given instructions from a user, are capable of autonomously and intelligently realise a given task. By means of such agents, the bargaining process can be automated, allowing products and services together with related conditions, such as warranty and delivery time, to be flexible and tuned to the individual preferences of the people concerned. In this theses we concentrate on both fundamental aspects of bargaining as well as business-related applications of automated bargaining using software agents. The fundamental part investigates bargaining outcomes within a stylised world, and the factors that influence these outcomes. This can provide insights for the production of software agents, strategies, and setting up bargaining rules for practical situations. We study these aspects using computational simulations of bargaining agents. Hereby we consider adaptive systems, i.e., where agents learn to adjust their bargaining strategy given past experience. This learning behaviour is simulated using evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms originate from the field of artificial intelligence, and are inspired by the biological theory of evolution. Originally, evolutionary algorithms were designed for solving optimisation problems, but they are now increasingly being used within economics for modelling human learning behaviour. Besides computational simulations, we also consider mathematical solutions from game theory for relatively simple cases. Game theory is mainly concerned with the “rational man”, that is, with optimal outcomes within an stylised setting (or game) where people act rationally. We use the game-theoretic outcomes to validate the computational experiments. The advantage of computer simulations is that less strict assumptions are necessary, and that more complex interactions that are closer to real-world settings can be investigated. First of all, we study a bargaining setting where two players exchange offers and counter offers, the so-called alternating-offers game. This game is frequently used for modelling bargaining about for instance the price of a product or service. It is also important, however, to allow other product- and service-related aspects to be negotiated, such as quality, delivery time, and warranty. This enables compromises by conceding on less important issues and demanding a higher value for relatively important aspects. This way, bargaining is less competitive and the resulting outcome can be mutually beneficial. Therefore, we investigate using computational simulations an extended version of the alternating-offers game, where multiple aspects are negotiated concurrently. Moreover, we apply game theory to validate the results of the computational experiments. The simulation shows that learning agents are capable of quickly finding optimal compromises, also called Pareto-efficient outcomes. In addition, we study the effects of time pressure that arise if negotiations are broken off with a small probability, for example due to external eventualities. In absence of time pressure and a maximum number of negotiation rounds, outcomes are very unbalanced: the player that has the opportunity to make a final offer proposes a take-it-or-leave-it offer in the last round, which leaves the other player with a deal that is only slightly better than no deal at all. With relatively high time pressure, on the other hand, the first offer is most important and almost all agreements are reached in the first round. Another interesting result is that the simulation outcomes after a long period of learning in general coincide with the results from game theory, in spite of the fact that the learning agents are not “rational”. In reality, not only the final outcome is important, but also other factors play a role, such as the fairness of an offer. Using the simulation we study the influence of such fairness norms on the bargaining outcomes. The fairness norms result in much more balanced outcomes, even with no time pressure, and seem to be closer outcomes in the real world. Negotiations are rarely isolated, but can also be influenced by external factors such as additional bargaining opportunities. We therefore also consider bargaining within a market-like setting, where both buyers and sellers can bargain with several opponents before reaching an agreement. The negotiations are executed consecutively until an agreement is reached or no more opportunities are available. Each bargaining game is reduced to a single round, where player 1 makes an offer and player 2 can only respond by rejecting or accepting this offer. Using an evolutionary simulation we study several properties of this market game. It appears that the outcomes depend on the information that is available to the players. If players are informed about the bargaining opportunities of their opponents, the first player in turn has the advantage and always proposes a take-it-or-leave-it deal that leaves the other player with a relatively poor outcome. This outcome is consistent with a game-theoretic analysis which we also present in this thesis. If this information is not available, a theoretical analysis is very hard. The evolutionary simulation, however, shows that in this case the responder obtains a better deal. This occurs because the first player can no longer anticipate the response of the other player, and therefore bids lower to avoid a disagreement. In this thesis, we additionally consider other factors that influence the outcomes of the market game, such as negotiation over multiple issues simultaneously, search costs, and break off probabilities. Besides fundamental issues, this thesis presents a number of business-related applications of automated bargaining, as well as generic bargaining strategies for agents that can be employed in related areas. As a first application, we introduce a framework where negotiation is used for recommending shops to customers, for example on a web page of an electronic shopping mall. Through a market-driven auction a relevant selection of shops is determined in a distributed fashion. This is achieved by selling a limited number of banner spaces in an electronic auction. For each arriving customer on the web page, shops can automatically place bids for this “customer attention space” through their shop agents. These software agents bid based on a customer profile, containing personal data of the customer, such as age, interests, and/or keywords in a search query. The shop agents are adaptive and learn, given feedback from the customers, which profiles to target and how much to bid in the auction. The highest bidders are then selected and displayed to the customer. The feasibility of this distributed approach for matching shops to customers is demonstrated using an evolutionary simulation. Several customer models and auction mechanisms are studied, and we show that the market-based approach results in a proper selection of shops for the customers. Bargaining can be especially beneficial if not only the price, but other aspects are considered as well. This allows for example to customise products and services to the personal preferences of a user. We developed a system makes use of these properties for selling and personalising so-called information goods, such as news articles, software, and music. Using the alternating-offers protocol, a seller agent negotiates with several buyers simultaneously about a fixed price, a per-item price, and the quality of a bundle of information goods. The system is capable of taking into account important business-related conditions such as the fairness of the negotiation. The agents combine a search strategy and a concession strategy to generate offers in the negotiations. The concession strategy determines the amount the agent will concede each round, whereas the search strategy takes care of the personalisation of the offer. We introduce two search strategies in this thesis, and show through computer experiments that the use of these strategies by a buyer and seller agent, result in personalised outcomes, also when combined with various concession strategies. The search strategies presented here can be easily applied to other domains where personalisation is important. In addition, we also developed concession strategies for the seller agent that can be used in settings where a single seller agent bargains with several buyer agents simultaneously. Even if bargaining itself is bilateral (i.e., between two parties), a seller agent can actually benefit from the fact that several such negotiations occur concurrently. The developed strategies are focussed on domains where supply is flexible and can be adjusted to meet demand, like for information goods. We study fixed strategies, time-dependent strategies and introduce several auction-inspired strategies. Auctions are often used when one party negotiates with several opponents simultaneously. Although the latter strategies benefit from the advantages of auctions, the actual negotiation remains bilateral and consists of exchanging offers and counter offers. We developed an evolutionary simulation environment to evaluate the seller agent’s strategies. We especially consider the case where buyers are time-impatient and under pressure to reach agreements early. The simulations show that the auction-inspired strategies are able to obtain almost maximum profits from the negotiations, given sufficient time pressure of the buyers","Autonomous Agents in Bargaining Games: An Evolutionary Investigation of Fundamentals, Strategies, and Business Applications",,,,,core
301378568,2018-11-28T08:00:00,"Abstract The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the feasibility of business-to-consumer (B2C) customer relationship analytics in the industrial business-to-business (B2B) context, in particular spare part sales. The contribution of the paper is twofold; the article identifies analytics approaches with value potential for B2B decision-making, and illustrates their value in use. The identified analytics approaches, customer segmentation, market basket analysis and target customer selection, are common in the B2C marketing and e-commerce. However, in the industrial B2B marketing, the application of these approaches is not yet common.. The different kinds of analytics under examination in this paper use machine learning (ML) techniques. The examination takes into account the applicability and usefulness of the techniques as well as implementation challenges. The research suggests that the identified analytics may serve different business purposes and may be relatively straightforward to implement. This requires careful examination of the desired purposes of use in a particular business context. However, the continuous and real-time use of such analyses remains a challenge for further examination also in information systems research.

301383852,2019-11-07T06:51:49,"Conversational user interfaces (CUI) enable real-time communication between the buyer and the seller in electronic commerce based on natural spoken or written language. Although first insights reveal that customers have privacy concerns with CUI that prevent them from adoption, online retailers have especially and increasingly implemented messaging services (e.g., live chats on websites) combined with artificial intelligence. Against this background, and drawing on information systems and consumer research, the current research investigates how the mere presence of messaging services on websites influences website users’ privacy concerns. The results of two online experiments reveal that the presence of CUI evokes perceptions of a social presence that translate into perceptions of being watched, thus positively influencing the privacy concern. The findings of this study extend the those of previous research by revealing that perceived social presence elicited by the presence of CUI also yields negative effects. Moreover, the literature on privacy concerns is enhanced by providing an explanation for the effects of social presence",Can Conversational User Interfaces Be Harmful?

359967044,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Recommendation system can predict the ratings of users to items by leveraging machine learning algorithms. The use of recommendation systems is common in e-commerce websites now-a-days. Since enormous amounts of data including users’ click streams, purchase history, demographics, social networking comments and user-item ratings are stored in e-commerce systems databases, the volume of the data is getting bigger at high speed, and the data is sparse. However, the recommendations and predictions must be made in real time, enabling to bring enormous benefits to human beings. Apache spark is well suited for applications which require high speed query of data, transformation and analytics results. Therefore, the recommendation system developed in this research is implemented on Apache Spark. Also, the matrix factorization using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm which is a type of collaborative filtering is used to solve overfitting issues in sparse data and increases prediction accuracy. The overfitting problem arises in the data as the user-item rating matrix is sparse. In this research a recommendation system for e-commerce using alternating least squares (ALS) matrix factorization method on Apache Spark MLlib is developed. The research shows that the RMSE value is significantly reduced using ALS matrix factorization method and the RMSE is 0.870. Consequently, it is shown that the ALS algorithm is suitable for training explicit feedback data set where users provide ratings for items.ISBN för värdpublikation: 978-3-030-68153-1,  978-3-030-68154-8</p",Recommendation System for E-commerce Using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) on Apache Spark,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1007/978-3-030-68154-8_75,,core

200820501,2019-04-02T00:00:00,"Nowadays, more and more customers browse and purchase products in favor of
using mobile E-Commerce Apps such as Taobao and Amazon. Since merchants are
usually inclined to describe redundant and over-informative product titles to
attract attentions from customers, it is important to concisely display short
product titles on limited screen of mobile phones. To address this discrepancy,
previous studies mainly consider textual information of long product titles and
lacks of human-like view during training and evaluation process. In this paper,
we propose a Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Network (MM-GAN) for short
product title generation in E-Commerce, which innovatively incorporates image
information and attribute tags from product, as well as textual information
from original long titles. MM-GAN poses short title generation as a
reinforcement learning process, where the generated titles are evaluated by the
discriminator in a human-like view. Extensive experiments on a large-scale
E-Commerce dataset demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we deploy our model into a real-world
online E-Commerce environment and effectively boost the performance of click
through rate and click conversion rate by 1.66% and 1.87%, respectively.Comment: Accepted by NAACL-HLT 2019. arXiv admin note: substantial text

327123147,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"High-order interactive features capture the correlation between different
columns and thus are promising to enhance various learning tasks on ubiquitous
tabular data. To automate the generation of interactive features, existing
works either explicitly traverse the feature space or implicitly express the
interactions via intermediate activations of some designed models. These two
kinds of methods show that there is essentially a trade-off between feature
interpretability and search efficiency. To possess both of their merits, we
propose a novel method named Feature Interaction Via Edge Search (FIVES), which
formulates the task of interactive feature generation as searching for edges on
the defined feature graph. Specifically, we first present our theoretical
evidence that motivates us to search for useful interactive features with
increasing order. Then we instantiate this search strategy by optimizing both a
dedicated graph neural network (GNN) and the adjacency tensor associated with
the defined feature graph. In this way, the proposed FIVES method simplifies
the time-consuming traversal as a typical training course of GNN and enables
explicit feature generation according to the learned adjacency tensor.
Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world datasets show the
advantages of FIVES over several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the
interactive features identified by FIVES are deployed on the recommender system
of Taobao, a worldwide leading e-commerce platform. Results of an online A/B
testing further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method FIVES, and we
further provide FIVES as AI utilities for the customers of Alibaba Cloud.Comment: Accepted by KDD-2",FIVES: Feature Interaction Via Edge Search for Large-Scale Tabular Data,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14573,,,,core

234922210,2017,"Presently, garment fit evaluation mainly focuses on real try-on, and rarely deals with virtual try-on. With the rapid development of E-commerce, there is a profound growth of garment purchases through the internet. In this context, fit evaluation of virtual garment try-on is vital in the clothing industry. In this paper, we propose a Naive Bayes-based model to evaluate garment fit. The inputs of the proposed model are digital clothing pressures of different body parts, generated from a 3D garment CAD software; while the output is the predicted result of garment fit (fit or unfit). To construct and train the proposed model, data on digital clothing pressures and garment real fit was collected for input and output learning data respectively. By learning from these data, our proposed model can predict garment fit rapidly and automatically without any real try-on; therefore, it can be applied to remote garment fit evaluation in the context of e-shopping. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method was validated using a set of test samples. Test results showed that digital clothing pressure is a better index than ease allowance to evaluate garment fit, and machine learning-based garment fit evaluation methods have higher prediction accuracies",Fit evaluation of virtual garment try-on by learning from digital pressure data,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234922210.pdf,'Elsevier BV',10.1016/j.knosys.2017.07.007,,core

132440274,2008-01-01T00:00:00,"Data mining is a new discipline lying at the interface of statistics, database technology, pattern 
recognition, machine learning, and other areas. It is concerned with the secondary analysis of lar-
ge databases in order to find previously unsuspected relationships which are of interest or value 
to the database owners. There are two keys to success in data mining. First is coming up with 
a precise formulation of the problem you are trying to solve. A focused statement usually results 
in the best payoff. The second key is using the right data. After choosing from the data available 
to you, or perhaps buying external data, you may need to transform and combine it in significant 
ways. New problems arise, partly as a consequence of the sheer size of the data sets involved, and 
partly because of issues of pattern matching. H
owever, since statistics 
provides the intellectual 
glue underlying the effort, it is important for statisticians to become involved. There are very real 
opportunities for statisticians to make significant contributions. 
The main definition of data mining and the special data mining tasks are mentioned in the first 
part of this paper. The data mining problem was also discussed in previous issues of E+M. One 
method (clustering) was chosen to be a subject of this article. 
One of the opportunities to gain knowledge from data is a use of clustering analysis. Clustering 
analysis belongs to unsupervised methods of data mining. We put here a focus on this method. 
Some basic principles are described in the second part of this paper. This method is examined on 
two examples from the marketing field. In the first example is used software Statgraphics 5.0Plus 
(www.statgraphics.com) to solve clustering problem (nearest neighbour algorithm and Eucleidi-
an distance), and in the second example is used Statistica 6.0Cz software (from Statoft, Inc., 
www.statsoft.com or www.statsoft.cz).
But the building models is only one step in knowledge discovery. It is vital to properly collect and 
prepare the data, and to check the models against the real world. The „best“ model is often found 
after building models of several different types, or by trying different technologies or algorithms",Data mining with clustering,,Technická univerzita v Liberci,,,core

The system leverages technologies in natural language processing and human computer interaction to create a faster and more intuitive way of interacting with websites. By combining traditional AI rule-based technology with taxonomy mapping, the system is able to accommodate both customer and business requirements. Our user studies have demonstrated that, in the context of e-commerce, users preferred the natural language enabled navigation over menu-driven navigation (79 % to 21 % users). In addition, compared to a menu driven system, the average number of clicks used in the natural language system was reduced by 63.2 % and the average time was reduced by 33.3%. The NLSA system is currently deployed by IBM as a live pilot and we are collecting real user feedback. We believe that conversational interfaces like that of NLSA offer the ultimate personalization and can greatly enhance the user experience for websites.

Profile of A Volunteer
What is a Volunteer? A volunteer is a special
human being who helps others get a job done-any
job-without being paid. Volunteers are
found among men & women, the young & old,
the large & small, the educated & not-so-educated.
They come from all races, ethnic
groups, social & economic classes. While they
are not identifiable by appearance, ""by their
smiles you shall know them"". They are also
known by their willingness to jump to the task
at hand. Nobody rolls up their sleeves faster,
uses more elbow grease, & gets the job done
better. Volunteers are good at lots of things,
especially one that the rest of us don't get
around to doing. They can file, stuff, count,
sort, collect, distribute, bargain, organize,
supervise, manage. Volunteers have the tenacity
of mountain goats, the gentleness of lambs, the
strength of oxen, the speed of impalas, the
dependability of work horses & the eagerness
of new puppies. If we are comparing them to
animals, we must also note they are a breed
apart. They can raise funds, lower costs, spread
enthusiasm, reduce work loads, ease pressure &
warm hearts. They are pros at soothing,
cajoling, explaining, describing, convincing &
adapting. They often arrive just when the stress
is greatest, the moment bleakest, the work
hardest, the light in the tunnel the farthest
away. When the work is finished, try to say
""Thank You"" to a volunteer & he or she is apt
to say ""The Pleasure was all mine”.
******

Nutrition Basics
by Ted Bouvier
One of the major factors to whether you will loose
or gain weight is your metabolic rate. This determines
how your body will use up the nutrients you take in.
One way to increase your metabolism is to
increase your activity level. When you increase your
activity level, you need to increase your nutritional intake
appropriately. To sustain your new activities, you can
increase your intake by having 5-6 small balanced meals
each day.
By having a well balanced meal plan and a
moderate activity level every day, you will be able to start
increasing your metabolism. This in turn will make your
body more efficient in burning more calories.

pastry cloth or board, use a light dusting of
cornstarch. It actually works better than flour,
leaves no starchy aftertaste & makes cleanup
easier.

477990133,2020-12-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Identifying deceptive online reviews is a challenging tasks for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Collecting corpora for the task is difficult, because normally it is not possible to know whether reviews are genuine. A common workaround involves collecting (supposedly) truthful reviews online and adding them to a set of deceptive reviews obtained through crowdsourcing services. Models trained this way are generally successful at discriminating between `genuine¿ online reviews and the crowdsourced deceptive reviews. It has been argued that the deceptive reviews obtained via crowdsourcing are very different from real fake reviews, but the claim has never been properly tested. In this paper, we compare (false) crowdsourced reviews with a set of `real¿ fake reviews published on line. We evaluate their degree of similarity and their usefulness in training models for the detection of untrustworthy reviews. We find that the deceptive reviews collected via crowdsourcing are significantly different from the fake reviews published online. In the case of the artificially produced deceptive texts, it turns out that their domain similarity with the targets affects the models¿ performance, much more than their untruthfulness. This suggests that the use of crowdsourced datasets for opinion spam detection may not result in models applicable to the real task of detecting deceptive reviews. As an alternative method to create large-size datasets for the fake reviews detection task, we propose methods based on the probabilistic annotation of unlabeled texts, relying on the use of meta-information generally available on the e-commerce sites. Such methods are independent from the content of the reviews and allow to train reliable models for the detection of fake reviews.Leticia Cagnina thanks CONICET for the continued financial support.

323558776,2020-01-29T00:00:00,"International audienceAn A/B test evaluates the impact of a new technology by running it in a real production environment and testing its performance on a set of items. Recently, promising new methods are optimizing A/B tests with dynamic allocation. They allow for a quicker result regarding which variation (A or B) is the best, saving money for the user. However, dynamic allocation by traditional methods requires certain assumptions, which are not always verified in reality. This is mainly due to the fact that the populations tested are not homogeneous. This document reports on the new reinforcement learning methodology which has been deployed by the commercial A/B testing platform AB Tasty. We provide a new method that not only builds homogeneous groups for a user, but also allows to find the best variation for these groups in a short period of time. This paper provides numerical results on AB Tasty data, but also on public data sets, to demonstrate an improvement in A/B testing over traditional methods.Récemment en e-commerce, de nouvelles méthodes promet-teuses optimisent les A/B-Tests en utilisant une allocation dynamique des items aux variations permettant ainsi de déterminer plus rapidement la meilleure variation et donc de réduire les coûts du test. Cependant, ces méthodes qui peuvent s'apparenter à un apprentissage par renforcement, restent limitées à des données statiques et ne peuvent prendre en compte des données temporelles évolutives. Nous présentons ici deux nouvelles méthodes basées sur une approche commune, qui permettent d'intégrer des séries temporelles dans le profil des visiteurs. Nous montrons dans cet article qu'elles améliorent l'allocation dynamique des A/B-Tests en présentant des résultats obtenus sur des données issues de tests réels",Intégration des séries temporelles dans les A/B-Tests,,HAL CCSD,,,core

Recently, organisations are adopting/investigating spatial computing platforms (e.g. Autodesk, Toyota, BNP Paribas), offering new affordances for organising (e.g. carrying out tasks, communicating and collaborating). Spatial computing concerns achieving spatial interplay between the real and digital world (Agulhon 2016), enabling perception of physically present content. An emerging paradigm of spatial computing is enabled by hardware and software innovations for; 1) digitally mapping, tracking, understanding and predicting analog audio and visual spatial fields, 2) creating digital audio and visual spatial fields, and the (3) mixing and fusing of those fields. Mixed, augmented and immersive reality is then experienced by volumetric graphic rendering onto a human's field of view (FOV) (Martín-Gutiérrez et al. 2017). Emerging marketplace examples can be seen in 'Microsoft Hololens 2' and 'Magic Leap One' platforms, both creating/enabling an ecosystem of novel applications for both industrial, educational and leisure life contexts. With further convergence of IoT, haptics, 5G, cloud and AI etc., spatial applications will range from contextually aware and interactive; digital information layering of objects, guidance and decision support systems (DSS) within business operations (such as for industrial machine manufacture, monitoring, and maintenance), digital modelling & prototyping in R&D, through to applications for communications and collaborations (such as for spatial tele co-presence of people, objects and environments). More broadly, these advances have potential to catalyse disruptions within business, through to the labour and consumer marketplace via: (1) Virtualisation of hardware resources (e.g. fully digitising workplace equipment such as displays and interfaces, raw inputs for prototyping and even digital rendering of spaces). (2) Protection and strengthening of institutional knowledge and performance via knowledge capture, guidance and decision support of labour tasks and activity (e.g. reducing labour (re)training (e.g. parts assembly), knowledge capture of practice). (3) Creation and distribution of new value propositions in goods and services (e.g. digital item ownership in a mixed-reality cloud, spatial applications for IoT enabled devices). (4) Displacement of geographic space as cost, talent, time, access and convenience constraints on business (e.g. available talent pool, partner/customer reach and relations). (5) Collaboration through new/enhanced affordances for workers (e.g. shared digitised work tools/environments). Therefore, a paradigm of spatial computing will challenge the IS community to research new ways of working, and consequences for worker experience, meaning, productivity and power. With emerging advances in AI, automation and spatial computing, one of the pertinent enquires concerns importance of workers (sense of) agency (Chandra et al. 2019). Control in the IT context has been conceptualised as control over work, control over self, and control over technology (Beaudry and Pinsonneault 2005), with prior IS work studying locus of control related to; work stress (Chandra et al. 2019), intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Mujinga, M Eloff, MM Kroeze 2013), and performance (Vieira da Cunha et al. 2015) etc. With spatial computing platforms and their applications, what affordances of control and for whom should be developed? For example, the electronic representation of worker activity can be further enabled. Thus, tighter or looser coupling between worker activity and the reporting/outcome of work (Vieira da Cunha et al. 2015) becomes more of an organisational decision, with capability to monitor workers, and leverage AI for learning and optimisation. Furthermore, with development of spatial tele co-presence (STcP) (e.g. Mimesys), brings new affordances for communication with any worker(s), at any time, from anywhere. However, prior CMC research suggests people can choose different communication media specifically to manage social and emotional relationships (Madianou 2014) and their time (Mcloughlin et al. 2019). Hence, will such affordances serve greater identity fusion (Swann et al. 2012) and collaboration in organisations? Thus, we propose a socio-technical research agenda exploring 'control' related affordances for emerging spatial computing platforms, such as for STcP technology. In this regard, Control Theory can offer a useful starting frame, as it deals with control mechanisms governing workers organisational actions both formal (outcome and behaviour based) and informal (group and self-control), to further the interests of organisations (Kirsch 1996). We suggest, data and communication related affordances of control (e.g. privacy, exploitation, authenticity, availability and spaces) as starting points. Social Capital (Lin 2001), Social Influence (Kelman 1958), Social Identity (Ellemers and Haslam 2012), Identity Fusion (Swann et al. 2012) and Polymedia (Madianou and Miller 2012) being just some of the many relevant social theories to this endeavour",Affordances of Control in a Paradigm of Spatial Computing Platforms,,,,,core

convenient and straightforward services. One of the most fundamental problems
is how to balance the demand and supply in market segments to build an
efficient platform. While conventional machine learning models have achieved
great success on data-sufficient segments, it may fail in a large-portion of
segments in E-commerce platforms, where there are not sufficient records to
learn well-trained models. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context
of market segment demand prediction. The goal is to facilitate the learning
process in the target segments by leveraging the learned knowledge from
data-sufficient source segments. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm,
RMLDP, to incorporate a multi-pattern fusion network (MPFN) with a
meta-learning paradigm. The multi-pattern fusion network considers both local
and seasonal temporal patterns for segment demand prediction. In the
meta-learning paradigm, transferable knowledge is regarded as the model
parameter initialization of MPFN, which are learned from diverse source
segments. Furthermore, we capture the segment relations by combining
data-driven segment representation and segment knowledge graph representation
and tailor the segment-specific relations to customize transferable model
parameter initialization. Thus, even with limited data, the target segment can
quickly find the most relevant transferred knowledge and adapt to the optimal
parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale industrial
datasets. The results justify that our RMLDP outperforms a set of
state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, RMLDP has been deployed in Taobao, a
real-world E-commerce platform. The online A/B testing results further
demonstrate the practicality of RMLDP.Comment: First two authors contributed equally; Accepted by WSDM 202","Relation-aware Meta-learning for Market Segment Demand Prediction with

The system leverages technologies in natural language processing and human computer interaction to create a faster and more intuitive way of interacting with websites. By combining traditional AI rulebased technology with taxonomy mapping, the system is able to accommodate both customer and business requirements. Our user studies have demonstrated that, in the context of e-commerce, users preferred the natural language enabled navigation over menu-driven navigation (79 % to 21 % users). In addition, compared to a menu driven system, the average number of clicks used in the natural language system was reduced by 63.2 % and the average time was reduced by 33.3%. The NLSA system is currently deployed by IBM as a live pilot and we are collecting real user feedback. We believe that conversational interfaces like that of NLSA offer the ultimate personalization and can greatly enhance the user experience for websites",2001.

an intelligent computing era where AI is widely employed to augment services.
In this context, many innovative AI algorithms, systems, and architectures are
proposed, and thus the importance of benchmarking and evaluating them rises.
However, modern Internet services adopt a microservice-based architecture and
consist of various modules. The diversity of these modules and complexity of
execution paths, the massive scale and complex hierarchy of datacenter
infrastructure, the confidential issues of data sets and workloads pose great
challenges to benchmarking. In this paper, we present the first
industry-standard Internet service AI benchmark suite---AIBench with seventeen
industry partners, including several top Internet service providers. AIBench
provides a highly extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark framework
that contains loosely coupled modules. We identify sixteen prominent AI problem
domains like learning to rank, each of which forms an AI component benchmark,
from three most important Internet service domains: search engine, social
network, and e-commerce, which is by far the most comprehensive AI benchmarking
effort. On the basis of the AIBench framework, abstracting the real-world data
sets and workloads from one of the top e-commerce providers, we design and
implement the first end-to-end Internet service AI benchmark, which contains
the primary modules in the critical paths of an industry scale application and
is scalable to deploy on different cluster scales. The specifications, source
code, and performance numbers are publicly available from the benchmark council

295571477,2008-01-01T00:00:00,"Data mining is a new discipline lying at the interface of statistics, database technology, pattern 
recognition, machine learning, and other areas. It is concerned with the secondary analysis of lar-
ge databases in order to find previously unsuspected relationships which are of interest or value 
to the database owners. There are two keys to success in data mining. First is coming up with 
a precise formulation of the problem you are trying to solve. A focused statement usually results 
in the best payoff. The second key is using the right data. After choosing from the data available 
to you, or perhaps buying external data, you may need to transform and combine it in significant 
ways. New problems arise, partly as a consequence of the sheer size of the data sets involved, and 
partly because of issues of pattern matching. H
owever, since statistics 
provides the intellectual 
glue underlying the effort, it is important for statisticians to become involved. There are very real 
opportunities for statisticians to make significant contributions. 
The main definition of data mining and the special data mining tasks are mentioned in the first 
part of this paper. The data mining problem was also discussed in previous issues of E+M. One 
method (clustering) was chosen to be a subject of this article. 
One of the opportunities to gain knowledge from data is a use of clustering analysis. Clustering 
analysis belongs to unsupervised methods of data mining. We put here a focus on this method. 
Some basic principles are described in the second part of this paper. This method is examined on 
two examples from the marketing field. In the first example is used software Statgraphics 5.0Plus 
(www.statgraphics.com) to solve clustering problem (nearest neighbour algorithm and Eucleidi-
an distance), and in the second example is used Statistica 6.0Cz software (from Statoft, Inc., 
www.statsoft.com or www.statsoft.cz).
But the building models is only one step in knowledge discovery. It is vital to properly collect and 
prepare the data, and to check the models against the real world. The „best“ model is often found 
after building models of several different types, or by trying different technologies or algorithms",Data mining with clustering,,Technická univerzita v Liberci,,,core

This led in recent years to major advances in the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with short reaction time and high precision. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of the fraud behavior makes it difficult to tailor existing systems to different contexts (e.g. new payment systems, different countries and/or population segments). Given the high cost (research, prototype development, and implementation in production) of designing data-driven FDSs, it is crucial for transactional companies to define procedures able to adapt existing pipelines to new challenges. From an AI/machine learning perspective, this is known as the problem of transfer learning. This paper discusses the design and implementation of transfer learning approaches for e-commerce credit card fraud detection and their assessment in a real setting. The case study, based on a six-month dataset (more than 200 million e-commerce transactions) provided by the industrial partner, relates to the transfer of detection models developed for a European country to another country. In particular, we present and discuss 15 transfer learning  techniques (ranging from naive baselines to state-of-the-art and new approaches), making a critical and quantitative comparison in terms of precision for different transfer scenarios. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we show that the accuracy of many transfer methods is strongly dependent on the number of labeled samples in the target domain and (ii) we propose an ensemble solution to this problem based on self-supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation classifiers. The thorough experimental assessment shows that this solution is both highly accurate and hardly sensitive to the number of labeled samples",Transfer Learning Strategies for Credit Card Fraud Detection.,https://core.ac.uk/download/491346803.pdf,,,,core

480151527,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"The article has dealt with the current trends of communication aspects of company’s relations

with the customers. The emphasis is placed on the necessity to review the companies’ marketing

strategies, in particular, due to communication constraints and the corresponding changes in the format

of both direct and feedback with the customers. Restrictive measures have changed the format of

competition, having created the conditions for its concentration in cyberspace. Changes in the nature

of interpersonal communication predetermined by the limited personal activity and the introduction

of remote forms of interaction, have generated demand for innovative ways of communication with

customers. Other factors that require the adjustment of marketing strategies include the emergence

of new behavioral capabilities of consumers associated with the intensive development of digital

communication channels.

It has been noted that in the digital communication environment, digital platforms provide the main

format of communication with the existing customer base and potential customers. In addition, prompt

acquisition and processing of data on purchasing behavior of customers allows companies to increase

significantly the “sensitivity” of marketing research and optimize their own marketing decisions. Among

the areas of increasing targeting and personalization of product offerings, the use of elements of artificial

intelligence and voice search has been accentuated. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence greatly

facilitates and simplifies the work of marketers on the processing and initial analysis of the growing flow

of digital marketing data, as well as provides greater efficiency. It has been concluded that widespread use

of voice assistants in e-commerce requires companies to rethink radically their approaches to internal data

processing, IT investment and customer engagement strategies.

Active integration of chatbots into various communication platforms is able to make them

universal tools for both business and consumers, which will allow them to become a familiar part of

the user experience. Implementation of virtual reality and augmented reality elements in the interface

of company websites can significantly diversify the process of collecting information by users and push

them to unplanned purchases.

It has been indicated that the growing standards of personalization and new rules of customer

confidentiality will continue to require companies to be flexible and introduce new technologies in

order to adapt permanently their business to new conditions. Focusing on building trust with customers\ud

275591324,2011-11-01T00:00:00,"Today, the need for architectures and computational models for large-scale open multi-agent systems is considered to be a key issue for the success of agent technology in real-world scenarios. This paper analyzes the significant unsolved problems that must be taken into account in order to develop real, open multi-agent systems. It identifies requirements and related open issues, discusses how some of these requirements have been tackled by current technologies, and explains how the THOMAS architecture is able to give support to these open issues. This paper also describes the THOMAS abstract architecture and computational model for large-scale open multi-agent systems based on a service-oriented approach that specifically addresses the design of virtual organizations.

200818569,2019-06-05T00:00:00,"Quality product descriptions are critical for providing competitive customer
experience in an e-commerce platform. An accurate and attractive description
not only helps customers make an informed decision but also improves the
likelihood of purchase. However, crafting a successful product description is
tedious and highly time-consuming. Due to its importance, automating the
product description generation has attracted considerable interests from both
research and industrial communities. Existing methods mainly use templates or
statistical methods, and their performance could be rather limited. In this
paper, we explore a new way to generate the personalized product description by
combining the power of neural networks and knowledge base. Specifically, we
propose a KnOwledge Based pErsonalized (or KOBE) product description generation
model in the context of e-commerce. In KOBE, we extend the encoder-decoder
framework, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation using
self-attention. In order to make the description both informative and
personalized, KOBE considers a variety of important factors during text
generation, including product aspects, user categories, and knowledge base,
etc. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
out-performs the baseline on various metrics. KOBE can achieve an improvement
of 9.7% over state-of-the-arts in terms of BLEU. We also present several case
studies as the anecdotal evidence to further prove the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. The framework has been deployed in Taobao, the largest
online e-commerce platform in China.Comment: KDD 2019 Camera-ready. Website:

Predicting demand accurately is critical for organizations in order to be able
to make plans. In this paper, we propose a new approach for demand prediction
on an e-commerce web site. The proposed model differs from earlier models in
several ways. The business model used in the e-commerce web site, for which the
model is implemented, includes many sellers that sell the same product at the
same time at different prices where the company operates a market place model.
The demand prediction for such a model should consider the price of the same
product sold by competing sellers along the features of these sellers. In this
study we first applied different regression algorithms for specific set of
products of one department of a company that is one of the most popular online
e-commerce companies in Turkey. Then we used stacked generalization or also
known as stacking ensemble learning to predict demand. Finally, all the
approaches are evaluated on a real world data set obtained from the e-commerce
company. The experimental results show that some of the machine learning
methods do produce almost as good results as the stacked generalization method.Comment: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Data Science,

The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage",Data-Driven Methodology to Support Long-Lasting Logistics and Decision Making for Urban Last-Mile Operations,,'MDPI AG',10.3390/su13116230,,core

Data is extracted from the sensors embedded within the Smart city, infrastructure, or building via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and inserted into a Data Marketplace. The technology is based on smart contracts deployed on a private ethereum blockchain. Current issues with data in Smart cities, infrastructure, buildings, or any real estate, are the difficulty of its access and retrieval, therefore integration; its quality in terms of meaningful information; its large quantity with a reduced coverage in terms of systems and finally its authenticity, as data can be manipulated for economic advantage. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a Data Marketplace model with a hierarchical process for data validation and verification where each stage adds a layer of data abstraction, value-added services and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence. By using a blockchain, this presented approach is based on a decentralised method where each stakeholder stores the data. The proposed model is validated in a real application with live data: Newcastle urban observatory smart city project",Validation and Verification of Data Marketplaces,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1007/978-3-030-79150-6_61,,core

companies, acts as a source of truth for key information, and enables building
advanced solutions, e.g., predictive models, machine learning, real-time
recommendations, to grow the business.
  A self-service, multi-tenant, API-first, and scalable data platform is the
foundational requirement in creating an enterprise data marketplace, which
enables the creation, publishing, and exchange of data products. Such a
marketplace enables the exploration and discovery of data products, further
providing high-level data governance and oversight on marketplace contents. In
this paper, we describe our way to the gourmet data product marketplace. We
cover the design principles, the implementation details, technology choices,
and the journey to build an enterprise data platform that meets the above
characteristics. The platform consists of ingestion, streaming, storage,
transformation, schema generation, fail-safe, data sharing, access management,
PII data automatic identification, self-service storage optimization
recommendations, and CI/CD integration.
  We then show how the platform enables and operates the data marketplace,
facilitating the exchange of stable data products across users and tenants. We
motivate and show how we run scalable decentralized data governance. All of
this is built and run for Cimpress Technology (CT), which operates the Mass
Customization Platform for Cimpress and its businesses. The CT data platform
serves 1000s of users from different platform participants, with data sourced
from heterogeneous sources. Data is ingested at a rate of well over 1000
individual messages per second and serves more than 100k analytical queries
daily.Comment: Peer reviewe","The Trip to The Enterprise Gourmet Data Product Marketplace through a

270168619,2019-10-31T00:00:00,"The effective solution of regression problems is an important task for e-commerce, medicine, business analytics and for many other industries. In recent years, the demand to use artificial intelligence methods for solving regression problems has been rapidly increased. This can be explained by the need to work with large datasets, or the complex interrelationships between multiple independent variables. General regression neural network is one of the options for solving this problem. However, the use of this computational intelligence method does not provide high accuracy of the result, which imposes a number of limitations. The new method based on a general regression neural network ensemble for increasing prediction task accuracy is developed. The main advantages and disadvantages of neural networks of this type are described in detail. A brief description of the operation of the general regression neural network is given. An algorithmic implementation of the developed ensemble is provided. An increased prediction accuracy using developed ensemble has been received. A software solution for the implementation of the described method with use libraries of Python programming language is developed. Experimental modeling of the method is conducted on real data of the regression problem. High efficiency of solving the problem is established using the developed method on the basis of both the mean absolute error in percentage and using the standard error. The method is compared with the existing ones: the Wiener polynomial approximation based on Stochastic Gradient Descent, the general regression neural network, and the modified AdaBoost algorithm. The highest accuracy of the solution of the problem by the developed method is proved experimentally based on both indicators of accuracy among all the methods considered in the work. In particular, it provides accuracy more than 3.4&nbsp;%, 4.3&nbsp;% and 8.3&nbsp;% (MAPE) compared to existing methods. The method developed can be used to obtain high-precision solutions for solving applications of e-commerce, medicine, materials science, business analytics and others. The plan for further researches is to develop a hybrid high-speed computational intelligence system based on the combination of the developed method and the successive geometric transformations model (SGTM).Розроблено метод ансамблювання нейронних мереж узагальненої регресії для підвищення точності розв'язання задачі прогнозування.

A lot of time and effort is put to check different furniture items from different stores, and to make sure that these items match together. We propose an Augmented Reality based mobile application for furniture shopping. The main objective of the proposed application is to enhance users experience while shopping for furniture. We incorporate state-of-the-art technologies that enable interaction with the physical and virtual environment simultaneously. The proposed application allows users to view items from different stores, as well as ’try’ them before buying using AR. Thus, users can choose the right color, shape and size while they are sitting at home. In this work, we followed the waterfall software engineering model and described each main component. Specifically, details of requirement gathering, software design and implementation, and software testing are presented here. The proposed application was implemented using Vuforia. The software testing verified and validated the developed application, and the results were compared in light of related work. For future work, we aim to further improve the users experience in furniture shopping by incorporating more state-of-the-art techniques, such as an AI-based shopping assistant or an ML-based recommender system",The design and implementation of an interactive mobile Augmented Reality application for an improved furniture shopping experience,,'ICI Bucharest',10.33436/v31i3y202106,"[{'title': 'Revista Română de Informatică și Automatică', 'identifiers': ['1220-1758', '1841-4303', 'issn:1220-1758', 'issn:1841-4303']}]",core

However, justifying and demonstrating the benefits of collaborative solutions remains a challenge and has been under-researched. Demonstrating the feasibility of implementing collaborative solutions as opposed to traditional, linear and transactional solutions is even less evident. The purpose of this paper is to conceive a collaborative solution that supports the multi-level DM process in a real, tree-based automotive supply chain environment. The hypothesis presented posits that by sharing information collaboratively, improvements in terms of the profit and service levels will be found within the supply chain and at every supply chain node.The authors thanks the support from the project 'Operations Design and Management in Global Supply Chains (GLOBOP)' (Ref.

481612216,2021-04-01T07:00:00,"With the availability of large scale data sets, researchers in many different areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, recommender systems have started making use of deep learning models and have achieved great progress in recent years. In this dissertation, we study three important classification problems based on deep learning models.
First, with the fast growth of e-commerce, more people choose to purchase products online and browse reviews before making decisions. It is essential to build a model to identify helpful reviews automatically. Our work is inspired by the observation that a customer\u27s expectation of a review can be greatly affected by review sentiment and the degree to which the customer is aware of pertinent product information. To model such customer expectation and capture important information from a review text, we propose a novel neural network which encodes the sentiment of a review through an attention module, and introduces a product attention layer that fuses information from both the target product and related products. Our experimental results for the task of identifying whether a review is helpful or not show an AUC improvement of 5.4\% and 1.5\% over the previous state of the art model on Amazon and Yelp data sets, respectively. We further validate the effectiveness of each attention layer of our model in two application scenarios. The results demonstrate that both attention layers contribute to the model performance, and the combination of them has a synergistic effect. We also evaluate our model performance as a recommender system using three commonly used metrics: NDCG@10, Precision@10 and Recall@10. Our model outperforms PRH-Net, a state-of-the-art model, on all three of these metrics.
Second, real-time bidding (RTB) that features per-impression-level real-time ad auctions has become a popular practice in today\u27s digital advertising industry. In RTB, click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental problem to ensure the success of an ad campaign and boost revenue. We present a dynamic CTR prediction model designed for the Samsung demand-side platform (DSP). We identify two key technical challenges that have not been fully addressed by the existing solutions: the dynamic nature of RTB and user information scarcity. To address both challenges, we develop a \ourmodel model. Our model effectively captures the dynamic evolutions of both users and ads and integrates auxiliary data sources (e.g., installed apps) to better model users\u27 preferences. We put forward a novel interaction layer that fuses both explicit user responses (e.g., clicks on ads) and auxiliary data sources to generate consolidated user preference representations. We evaluate our model using a large amount of data collected from the Samsung advertising platform and compare our method against several state-of-the-art methods that are likely suitable for real-world deployment. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the potential for production.
Third, for Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) purposes, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) must provide to the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) a classification of vehicles. However, due to limited lighting conditions at nighttime, classifying vehicles at nighttime is quite challenging. To solve this problem, we designed three CNN models to operate on thermal images. These three models have different architectures. Of these, model 2 achieves the best performance. Based on model 2, to avoid over-fitting and improve the performance further, we propose two training-test methods based on data augmentation technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the second training-test method improves the performance of model 2 further with regard to both accuracy and f1-score",Deep Learning based Models for Classification from Natural Language Processing to Computer Vision,https://core.ac.uk/download/481612216.pdf,Scholar Commons,,,core
386386252,2020-01-01T08:00:00,"Discrete sequences are the building blocks for many real-world problems in domains including genomics, e-commerce, and social sciences. While there are machine learning methods to classify and cluster sequences, they fail to explain what makes groups of sequences distinguishable. Although in some cases having a black box model is sufficient, there is a need for increased explainability in research areas focused on human behaviors. For example, psychologists are less interested in having a model that predicts human behavior with high accuracy and more concerned with identifying differences between actions that lead to divergent human behavior. This dissertation presents techniques for understanding differences between classes of discrete sequences. We leveraged our developed approaches to study two online collaborative environments: GitHub, a software development platform, and Minecraft, a multiplayer online game. The first approach measures the differences between groups of sequences by comparing k-gram representations of sequences using the silhouette score and characterizing the differences by analyzing the distance matrix of subsequences. The second approach discovers subsequences that are significantly more similar to one set of sequences vs. other sets. This approach, which is called contrast motif discovery, first finds a set of motifs for each group of sequences and then refines them to include the motifs that distinguish that group from other groups of sequences. Compared to existing methods, our technique is scalable and capable of handling long event sequences. Our first case study is GitHub. GitHub is a social coding platform that facilitates distributed, asynchronous collaborations in open source software development. It has an open API to collect metadata about users, repositories, and the activities of users on repositories. To study the dynamics of teams on GitHub, we focused on discrete event sequences that are generated when GitHub users perform actions on this platform. Specifically, we studied the differences that automated accounts (aka bots) make on software development processes and outcomes. We trained black box supervised learning methods to classify sequences of GitHub teams and then utilized our sequence analysis techniques to measure and characterize differences between event sequences of teams with bots and teams without bots. Teams with bots have relatively distinct event sequences from teams without bots in terms of the existence and frequency of short subsequences. Moreover, teams with bots have more novel and less repetitive sequences compared to teams with no bots. In addition, we discovered contrast motifs for human-bot and human-only teams. Our analysis of contrast motifs shows that in human-bot teams, discussions are scattered throughout other activities while in human-only teams discussions tend to cluster together. For our second case study, we applied our sequence mining approaches to analyze player behavior in Minecraft, a multiplayer online game that supports many forms of player collaboration. As a sandbox game, it provides players with a large amount of flexibility in deciding how to complete tasks; this lack of goal-orientation makes the problem of analyzing Minecraft event sequences more challenging than event sequences from more structured games.  Using our approaches, we were able to measure and characterize differences between low-level sequences of high-level actions and despite variability in how different players accomplished the same tasks, we discovered contrast motifs for many player actions.  Finally, we explored how the level of player collaboration affects the contrast motifs",Analyzing User Behavior in Collaborative Environments,https://core.ac.uk/download/386386252.pdf,'Information Bulletin on Variable Stars (IBVS)',,,core
323030829,2020-08-02T00:00:00,"Recently, neural networks have been widely used in e-commerce recommender
systems, owing to the rapid development of deep learning. We formalize the
recommender system as a sequential recommendation problem, intending to predict
the next items that the user might be interacted with. Recent works usually
give an overall embedding from a user's behavior sequence. However, a unified
user embedding cannot reflect the user's multiple interests during a period. In
this paper, we propose a novel controllable multi-interest framework for the
sequential recommendation, called ComiRec. Our multi-interest module captures
multiple interests from user behavior sequences, which can be exploited for
retrieving candidate items from the large-scale item pool. These items are then
fed into an aggregation module to obtain the overall recommendation. The
aggregation module leverages a controllable factor to balance the
recommendation accuracy and diversity. We conduct experiments for the
sequential recommendation on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Taobao.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves significant
improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our framework has also been
successfully deployed on the offline Alibaba distributed cloud platform.Comment: Accepted to KDD 202",Controllable Multi-Interest Framework for Recommendation,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09347,,,,core

The biclustering problem has been extensively studied in many areas including e-commerce, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, and more recently in computational biology. Given an n m matrix A (n � m), the main goal of biclustering is to identify a subset of rows (called objects) and a subset of columns (called properties) such that some objective function that specifies the quality of the found bicluster (formed by the subsets of rows and of columns of A) is optimized. The problem has been proved or conjectured to be NP-hard under various mathematical models. In this paper, we study a probabilistic model of the implanted additive bicluster problem, where each element in the n m background matrix is a random number from [0 � L 1], and a k k implanted additive bicluster is obtained from an error-free additive bicluster by randomly changing each element to a number in [0 � L 1] with probability �. We propose an O(n2m) time voting algorithm to solve the 2 1 problem. We show that for any constant Æ such that (1 Æ)(1 �)  � 0, L when k � max 8 n log n � 8logn log(2L),wherecisaconstant number, the c voting algorithm can correctly find the implanted bicluster with probability at 9 least 1 n2. We also implement our algorithm as a software tool for finding novel biclusters in microarray gene expression data, called VOTE. The implementation incorporates several nontrivial ideas for estimating the size of an implanted bicluster, adjusting the threshold in voting, dealing with small biclusters, and dealing with multiple (and overlapping) implanted biclusters.

An emerging marketplace for these components will allow for their exchange and distribution. To facilitate and boost the collaboration on the marketplace a solution for finding compatible artifacts is needed. We propose a concept to define compatibility on such a marketplace and suggest appropriate scenarios on how users can interact with it to support the different types of required compatibility. We also propose an initial architecture that derives from and implements the compatibility principles and makes the scenarios feasible. We matured our concept in focus group workshops and interviews with potential marketplace users from industry and academia.

387297127,2020-12-20T00:00:00,"Matrix factorization (MF) plays an important role in a wide range of machine
learning and data mining models. MF is commonly used to obtain item embeddings
and feature representations due to its ability to capture correlations and
higher-order statistical dependencies across dimensions. In many applications,
the categories of items exhibit a hierarchical tree structure. For instance,
human diseases can be divided into coarse categories, e.g., bacterial, and
viral. These categories can be further divided into finer categories, e.g.,
viral infections can be respiratory, gastrointestinal, and exanthematous viral
diseases. In e-commerce, products, movies, books, etc., are grouped into
hierarchical categories, e.g., clothing items are divided by gender, then by
type (formal, casual, etc.). While the tree structure and the categories of the
different items may be known in some applications, they have to be learned
together with the embeddings in many others. In this work, we propose eTREE, a
model that incorporates the (usually ignored) tree structure to enhance the
quality of the embeddings. We leverage the special uniqueness properties of
Nonnegative MF (NMF) to prove identifiability of eTREE. The proposed model not
only exploits the tree structure prior, but also learns the hierarchical
clustering in an unsupervised data-driven fashion. We derive an efficient
algorithmic solution and a scalable implementation of eTREE that exploits
parallel computing, computation caching, and warm start strategies. We showcase
the effectiveness of eTREE on real data from various application domains:

151256256,2018-03-01T00:00:00,"Bidding optimization is one of the most critical problems in online
advertising. Sponsored search (SS) auction, due to the randomness of user query
behavior and platform nature, usually adopts keyword-level bidding strategies.
In contrast, the display advertising (DA), as a relatively simpler scenario for
auction, has taken advantage of real-time bidding (RTB) to boost the
performance for advertisers. In this paper, we consider the RTB problem in
sponsored search auction, named SS-RTB. SS-RTB has a much more complex dynamic
environment, due to stochastic user query behavior and more complex bidding
policies based on multiple keywords of an ad. Most previous methods for DA
cannot be applied. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) solution for
handling the complex dynamic environment. Although some RL methods have been
proposed for online advertising, they all fail to address the ""environment
changing"" problem: the state transition probabilities vary between two days.
Motivated by the observation that auction sequences of two days share similar
transition patterns at a proper aggregation level, we formulate a robust MDP
model at hour-aggregation level of the auction data and propose a
control-by-model framework for SS-RTB. Rather than generating bid prices
directly, we decide a bidding model for impressions of each hour and perform
real-time bidding accordingly. We also extend the method to handle the

382462970,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Recommendation system can predict the ratings of users to items by leveraging machine learning algorithms. The use of recommendation systems is common in e-commerce websites now-a-days. Since enormous amounts of data including users’ click streams, purchase history, demographics, social networking comments and user-item ratings are stored in e-commerce systems databases, the volume of the data is getting bigger at high speed, and the data is sparse. However, the recommendations and predictions must be made in real time, enabling to bring enormous benefits to human beings. Apache spark is well suited for applications which require high speed query of data, transformation and analytics results. Therefore, the recommendation system developed in this research is implemented on Apache Spark. Also, the matrix factorization using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm which is a type of collaborative filtering is used to solve overfitting issues in sparse data and increases prediction accuracy. The overfitting problem arises in the data as the user-item rating matrix is sparse. In this research a recommendation system for e-commerce using alternating least squares (ALS) matrix factorization method on Apache Spark MLlib is developed. The research shows that the RMSE value is significantly reduced using ALS matrix factorization method and the RMSE is 0.870. Consequently, it is shown that the ALS algorithm is suitable for training explicit feedback data set where users provide ratings for items.ISBN för värdpublikation: 978-3-030-68153-1,  978-3-030-68154-8</p",Recommendation System for E-commerce Using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) on Apache Spark,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1007/978-3-030-68154-8_75,,core

However, streamers’ service capacities cannot fulfill viewers’ needs for social interaction, resulting in a loss of viewer engagement and financial gains. Accordingly, we examine whether the implementation of an AI assistant that tracks, understands, and responds to viewers’ requests can facilitate social interaction and drive viewers’ purchase decision. In collaboration with Taobao.com, we conducted a randomized field experiment on its live streaming platform. In the experiment, a subject was either assigned to the treatment group with an AI assistant in each live streaming or the control group in which the AI assistant was absent. We will collect data to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI assistant. Our research contributes to the literature on the business value of AI applications and live streaming while implicates AI system designs for live streaming platforms",Effectiveness of AI Assistance in Live Streaming: A Randomized Field Experiment,,AIS Electronic Library (AISeL),,,core
