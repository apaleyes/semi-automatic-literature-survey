However, there are real problems in which the different values of the class are related to each other. Because of interest in this type of problem, several solutions have been proposed, such as cost-sensitive classifiers. Ensembles have proven to be very effective for classification tasks; however, as far as we know, there are no proposals that use a genetic-based methodology as the metaheuristic to create the models. In this paper, we present OCEAn, an ordinal classification algorithm based on an ensemble approach, which makes a final prediction according to a weighted vote system. This weighted voting takes into account weights obtained by a genetic algorithm that tries to minimize the cost of classification. To test the performance of this approach, we compared our proposal with ordinal classification algorithms in the literature and demonstrated that, indeed, our approach improves on previous results.",oceanology

Owing to this challenge, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are increasingly gaining more significance as robust strategies for producing more oil volumes from mature reservoirs. Water alternating gas (WAG) injection is an EOR method intended at improving the microscopic and macroscopic displacement efficiencies. To handle and implement successfully this technique, it is of vital importance to optimize its operating parameters. This study targeted at implementing robust proxy paradigms for investigating the suitable design parameters of a WAG project applied to real field data from “Gullfaks” in the North Sea. The proxy models aimed at reducing significantly the rum-time related to the commercial simulators without scarifying the accuracy. To this end, machine learning (ML) approaches, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) were implemented for estimating the needed parameters for the formulated optimization problem. To improve the reliability of these ML methods, they were evolved using optimization algorithms, namely Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) for MLP, and ant colony optimization (ACO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) for RBFNN. The performance analysis of the proxy models revealed that MLP-LMA has better prediction ability than the other two proxy paradigms. In this context, the highest average absolute relative deviation noticed per runs by MLP-LMA was lower than 3.60%. Besides, the best-implemented proxy was coupled with ACO and GWO for resolving the studied WAG optimization problem. The findings revealed that the suggested proxies are cheap, accurate, and practical in emulating the performance of numerical reservoir model. In addition, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of ACO and GWO in optimizing the parameters of WAG process for the real field data used in this study.",oceanology

Particularly, with regard to international standards from the World Health Organization (WHO/2017), and the national standards from Sudanese Standard and Meteorology Organization for drinking water (SDS-044/2007). Twenty locations site were investigated to represent this important area, where its analysed for compliance with the national and international standards, furthermore, the suitability for drinking purpose was assessed by using water quality index (WQI) method. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied to predict the QWI by using the algorithm of feed forward back propagation artificial neural networks (BP ANN) for optimization. Physio-chemical assessments indicated that, water resources did not conform to the safe limits, especially heavy metals likes cadmium, which has the highest concentrations-hazard in almost all samples. High lead levels were observed at nineteen sites, while a high concentrations of nickel, and Total dissolved solids were observed at seven locations. The microbial assessment indicated most of locations did not conform to the safe limits, a high bacteria –hazard for Total coliform and Escherichia coli were observed in fourteen, and seven locations, respectively. Computed WQI values ranged from 35.61 to 337.52. ANN model showed much high prediction accuracy of WQI modeling with R2 values greater than 0.95 during training, testing and validation. WQI spatial distribution shown that, Red Sea State has unsuitable water quality in most of study sites (70%). The effects of heavy pollutants dominated on the water quality, and spread in these regions. This study conducted the first full-scale survey of the drinking water sources (ground and surface) in the Red Sea State of Sudan. Based on these results, we recommended that, an urgent measures such as a chemical treatments to treat the pollution, with/or filters installation should be implemented as soon as possible to manage and protect the water resources.",oceanology

In rock engineering, features of data play a leading role in determining the feasible methods of its proper manipulation. The present study focuses on resolving one of the major deficiencies of conventional neural networks (NNs) in dealing with rock engineering data. Herein, since the samples are obtained from hundreds of meters below the surface with the utmost difficulty, the number of samples is always limited. Meanwhile, the experimental analysis of these samples may result in many repetitive values and 0s. However, conventional neural networks are incapable of making robust models in the presence of such data. On the other hand, these networks strongly depend on the initial weights and bias values for making reliable predictions. With this in mind, the current research introduces a novel kind of neural network processing framework for the geological that does not suffer from the limitations of the conventional NNs. The introduced single-data-based feature engineering network extracts all the information wrapped in every single data point without being affected by the other points. This method, being completely different from the conventional NNs, re-arranges all the basic elements of the neuron model into a new structure. Therefore, its mathematical calculations were performed from the very beginning. Moreover, the corresponding programming codes were developed in MATLAB and Python since they could not be found in any common programming software at the time being. This new kind of network was first evaluated through computer-based simulations of rock cracks in the 3DEC environment. After the model’s reliability was confirmed, it was adopted in two case studies for estimating respectively tensile strength and shear strength of real rock samples. These samples were coal core samples from the Southern Qinshui Basin of China, and gas hydrate-bearing sediment (GHBS) samples from the Nankai Trough of Japan. The coal samples used in the experiments underwent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging to investigate their original micro and macro fractures. Once done with these experiments, measurement of the rock mechanical properties, including tensile strength, was performed using a rock mechanical test system. However, the shear strength of GHBS samples was acquired through triaxial and direct shear tests. According to the obtained result, the new network structure outperformed the conventional neural networks in both cases of simulation-based and case study estimations of the tensile and shear strength. Even though the proposed approach of the current study originally aimed at resolving the issue of having a limited dataset, its unique properties would also be applied to larger datasets from other subsurface measurements.",oceanology

The WNN was developed without any labeled training data to simulate the non-anomalous behaviors for next-step prediction. The classifying threshold was constructed according to the estimated distribution of long-term historical residual errors. The observation strategy (OS) and prediction strategy (PS) were designed to detect new unknown anomalies. Two types of marine observing time series from a buoy, deployed at the National Ocean Test Site of China, were selected for verifying the method. The results show that 99% of classifying confidence level is adequate to provide a reasonable trade-off between the false negative and false positive. By using the two detecting strategies and selecting proper estimated distribution of the threshold, the method is efficient for identifying the anomalous points and patterns which were caused by the natural factors or equipment failures. Compared with traditional ANN and wavelet-ANN, the WNN-based method is more tolerant to noise and more sensitive to anomalies with temporal dependencies. Furthermore, this approach introduced here can work in a real-time way and will help ocean engineering managers to obtain informed decisions.",oceanology

The nodes connecting the weights of the RWENN are trained online using a backpropagation method. A modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA) is developed to adjust the learning rates and improve learning capability. The proposed control scheme has improved the real power regulation and dynamic performance of a combined wind and ocean wave energy scheme over a wide range of operating conditions. The performance of this control scheme is assessed by comparing it to a traditional proportional-integral based control scheme in a series of case studies representative of maximum power generation. Simulations are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC software to verify the robustness of the power electronics converters and the efficiency of the proposed controller under steady state and transient conditions.,oceanology

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this extraction technique is applied to the analysis of UV filters in sand samples, and in other kind of environmental solid samples. Main extraction parameters such as the fibre coating, the amount of sample, the addition of salt, the volume of water added to the sand, and the temperature were optimized. An experimental design approach was implemented in order to find out the most favourable conditions. The final conditions consisted of adding 1 mL of water to 1 g of sample followed by the headspace SPME for 20 min at 100 °C, using PDMS/DVB as fibre coating. The SPME-GC–MS/MS method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, limits of detection and quantification, and precision. Recovery studies were also performed at three concentration levels in real Atlantic and Mediterranean sand samples. The recoveries were generally above 85% and relative standard deviations below 11%. The limits of detection were in the pg g−1 level. The validated methodology was successfully applied to the analysis of real sand samples collected from Atlantic Ocean beaches in the Northwest coast of Spain and Portugal, Canary Islands (Spain), and from Mediterranean Sea beaches in Mallorca Island (Spain). The most frequently found UV filters were ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS), homosalate (HMS), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC), 2-ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (2EHMC) and octocrylene (OCR), with concentrations up to 670 ng g−1.",oceanology

However the low-light and high-noise scenarios pose great challenges for the underwater image and video analysis. We here propose a CNN knowledge transfer framework for underwater object recognition and tackle the problem of extracting discriminative features from relatively low contrast images. Even with the insufficient training set, the transfer framework can well learn a recognition model for the special underwater object recognition task together with the help of data augmentation. For better identifying objects from an underwater video, a weighted probabilities decision mechanism is introduced to identify the object from a series of frames. The proposed framework can be implemented for real-time underwater object recognition on autonomous underwater vehicles and video monitoring systems. To verify the effectiveness of our method, experiments on a public dataset are carried out. The results show that the proposed method achieves promising results for underwater object recognition on both test image datasets and underwater videos.",oceanology

Due to the distinction of system responses for various sea states, four motion signals including surge, sway, roll and yaw are adopted for classification purpose. Firstly, preprocessing techniques, like filtration and k-means clustering are performed to the raw data to filter out the “corrupted” low frequency (LF) information and generate the band-pass filter bank. Then, the processed data is decomposed into 20 categories via Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), filter bank method and wavelet transform and 11 statistical features are extracted for each category. Subsequently, Max-relevance Min-redundancy (mRMR) method helps to select salient features with best trade-off between relevance and redundancy. With these selected features, a newly developed three-layer classification structure with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Random Forest (RF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based combination classifiers is proposed to derive the current sea state. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed identification system can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. Moreover, the multi-layer classifier outperforms single layer classifier and can rapidly classify the sea state in real-time implementation.",oceanology

Expert sailors are able to combine observations on these various factors and process them to take optimal decisions. This study presents an attempt at emulating this decision process through a computer code that can be used in real time to advise on race strategy. The novelty of the proposed method consists in combining various approaches for the multiple factors affecting the decision process.
                  The wind variability is modelled with the use of neural networks, to produce a short-term wind forecast. The willingness of the sailor to risk is modelled using coherent-risk measures. Experimental results are used to quantify the loss of speed due to the presence of a nearby opponent. Finally, all these factors are combined through dynamic programming to compute an optimal course, based also on information on the current and yachts performance.

During the exercise, CTD data have been collected responding to the necessity of a Rapid Environmental Assessment, i.e. to a rapid evaluation of the marine conditions able to provide sensible information for initialisation of modelling tools, in the scenario of possible maritime accidents. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of such mesoscale-resolving CTD observations on short-term forecasts of the surface currents, within the framework of possible oil-spill related emergencies. For this reason, modelling outputs were compared with Lagrangian observations at sea: the high resolution modelled currents, together with the ones of the coarser sub-regional model WMED, are used to force the MEDSLIK-II oil-spill model to simulate drifter trajectories. Both ocean models have been assessed by comparing the prognostic scalar and vector fields as an independent CTD data set and with real drifter trajectories acquired during SG1. The diagnosed and prognosed circulation reveals that the area was characterised by water masses of Atlantic origin influenced by small mesoscale cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies, which govern the spatial and temporal evolution of the drifter trajectories and of the water masses distribution. The assimilation of CTD data into the initial conditions of the high resolution model highly improves the accuracy of the short-term forecast in terms of location and structure of the thermocline and positively influence the ability of the model in reproducing the observed paths of the surface drifters.",oceanology

Colloidal silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with narrow size distribution and high stability were synthesized in water–in–oil microemulsion. This simple procedure was adapted to prepare highly monodispersed Ag NPs, starting from an initial synthesis in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) reverse micelles. Polythiophene (PT) was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization in the presence of anhydrous ferric chloride while its polymeric structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). Eventually, the prepared PT was dispersed in an AOT/n-decane solution containing Ag NPs for 1h in which the NPs were adsorbed on the polymer surface. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of NPs solution revealed that the monodisperse Ag NPs have been synthesized successfully with the size distribution below 10nm. Other instrumentations such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) confirmed the fabrication of the PT–Ag nanocomposite. The applicability of the synthesized sorbent was examined by needle trap extraction of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aqueous samples in conjunction with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS). Important parameters influencing the extraction process were optimized. The linearity for all analytes was in the concentration range of 0.01–10ngmL−1.

In this architecture, principal component analysis (PCA) is used in two convolutional layers, followed by binary hashing in the non-linear layer and block-wise histograms in the feature pooling layer. Then spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) is used to extract information invariant to large poses. Finally, a linear SVM classifier is used for the classification.

Several idealistic and real test scenarios were carried out. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of NNIA in terms of speeding-up model calculations and is fully capable of providing operationally acceptable model integrations. The ANN is able to emulate the exact nonlinear interaction for single-and multi-modal wave spectra with a much higher accuracy then Discrete Interaction Approximation (DIA). NNIA performs at least twice as fast as DIA and at least two hundred times faster than exact method (Web-Resio-Tracy, WRT) for a well trained dataset. The accuracy of NNIA is network configuration dependent.

Therefore, the ship collision risk assessment is of significant importance for ships passing through the narrow, shallow, and busy waterway.

These three risk indices for the Singapore Strait are estimated by using the real-time ship locations and sailing speeds provide by Lloyd's MIU automatic identification system (AIS). Based on estimation of these three risk indices, it can be concluded that Legs 4W, 5W, 11E, and 12E are the most risky legs in the Strait. Therefore, the ship collision risk reduction solutions should be prioritized being implemented in these four legs.

This would be useful for those stations where the costly wave buoys are not deployed and instead only meteorological buoys measuring wind are moored. The technique employs alternative artificial intelligence approaches of an artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP) and model tree (MT) to carry out the time series modeling of wind to obtain waves. Wind observations at four offshore sites along the east coast of India were used. For calibration purpose the wave data was generated using a numerical model.

Part II: Advancing computational efficiency of environmental numerical models,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0037379613,"A new generic neural network (NN) application—improving computational efficiency of certain processes in numerical environmental models—is considered. This approach can be used to accelerate the calculations and improve the accuracy of the parameterizations of several types of physical processes which generally require computations involving complex mathematical expressions, including differential and integral equations, rules, restrictions and highly nonlinear empirical relations based on physical or statistical models. It is shown that, from a mathematical point of view, such parameterizations can usually be considered as continuous mappings (continuous dependencies between two vectors) and, therefore, NNs can be used to replace primary parameterization algorithms. In addition to fast and accurate approximation of the primary parameterization, NN also provides the entire Jacobian for very little computation cost.
                  Four particular real-life applications of the NN approach are presented here: for oceanic numerical models, a NN approximation of the UNESCO equation of state of the sea water (NN for the density of the seawater) and an inversion of this equation (NN for the salinity of the seawater); for atmospheric numerical models, a NN approximation for long wave radiative transfer code; and for wave models, a NN approximation for the nonlinear wave–wave interaction. In all considered applications a significant acceleration of numerical computations has been achieved. The first two of these NN applications have already been implemented in the multi-scale ocean forecast system at NCEP.

Owing to this challenge, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are increasingly gaining more significance as robust strategies for producing more oil volumes from mature reservoirs. Water alternating gas (WAG) injection is an EOR method intended at improving the microscopic and macroscopic displacement efficiencies. To handle and implement successfully this technique, it is of vital importance to optimize its operating parameters. This study targeted at implementing robust proxy paradigms for investigating the suitable design parameters of a WAG project applied to real field data from “Gullfaks” in the North Sea. The proxy models aimed at reducing significantly the rum-time related to the commercial simulators without scarifying the accuracy. To this end, machine learning (ML) approaches, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) were implemented for estimating the needed parameters for the formulated optimization problem. To improve the reliability of these ML methods, they were evolved using optimization algorithms, namely Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) for MLP, and ant colony optimization (ACO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) for RBFNN. The performance analysis of the proxy models revealed that MLP-LMA has better prediction ability than the other two proxy paradigms. In this context, the highest average absolute relative deviation noticed per runs by MLP-LMA was lower than 3.60%. Besides, the best-implemented proxy was coupled with ACO and GWO for resolving the studied WAG optimization problem. The findings revealed that the suggested proxies are cheap, accurate, and practical in emulating the performance of numerical reservoir model.

Twenty locations site were investigated to represent this important area, where its analysed for compliance with the national and international standards, furthermore, the suitability for drinking purpose was assessed by using water quality index (WQI) method. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied to predict the QWI by using the algorithm of feed forward back propagation artificial neural networks (BP ANN) for optimization.

High lead levels were observed at nineteen sites, while a high concentrations of nickel, and Total dissolved solids were observed at seven locations.

In rock engineering, features of data play a leading role in determining the feasible methods of its proper manipulation. The present study focuses on resolving one of the major deficiencies of conventional neural networks (NNs) in dealing with rock engineering data. Herein, since the samples are obtained from hundreds of meters below the surface with the utmost difficulty, the number of samples is always limited. Meanwhile, the experimental analysis of these samples may result in many repetitive values and 0s. However, conventional neural networks are incapable of making robust models in the presence of such data. On the other hand, these networks strongly depend on the initial weights and bias values for making reliable predictions. With this in mind, the current research introduces a novel kind of neural network processing framework for the geological that does not suffer from the limitations of the conventional NNs. The introduced single-data-based feature engineering network extracts all the information wrapped in every single data point without being affected by the other points. This method, being completely different from the conventional NNs, re-arranges all the basic elements of the neuron model into a new structure. Therefore, its mathematical calculations were performed from the very beginning. Moreover, the corresponding programming codes were developed in MATLAB and Python since they could not be found in any common programming software at the time being. This new kind of network was first evaluated through computer-based simulations of rock cracks in the 3DEC environment. After the model’s reliability was confirmed, it was adopted in two case studies for estimating respectively tensile strength and shear strength of real rock samples. These samples were coal core samples from the Southern Qinshui Basin of China, and gas hydrate-bearing sediment (GHBS) samples from the Nankai Trough of Japan. The coal samples used in the experiments underwent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging to investigate their original micro and macro fractures. Once done with these experiments, measurement of the rock mechanical properties, including tensile strength, was performed using a rock mechanical test system. However, the shear strength of GHBS samples was acquired through triaxial and direct shear tests. According to the obtained result, the new network structure outperformed the conventional neural networks in both cases of simulation-based and case study estimations of the tensile and shear strength. Even though the proposed approach of the current study originally aimed at resolving the issue of having a limited dataset, its unique properties would also be applied to larger datasets from other subsurface measurements.",oceanology

The WNN was developed without any labeled training data to simulate the non-anomalous behaviors for next-step prediction. The classifying threshold was constructed according to the estimated distribution of long-term historical residual errors. The observation strategy (OS) and prediction strategy (PS) were designed to detect new unknown anomalies. Two types of marine observing time series from a buoy, deployed at the National Ocean Test Site of China, were selected for verifying the method. The results show that 99% of classifying confidence level is adequate to provide a reasonable trade-off between the false negative and false positive. By using the two detecting strategies and selecting proper estimated distribution of the threshold, the method is efficient for identifying the anomalous points and patterns which were caused by the natural factors or equipment failures. Compared with traditional ANN and wavelet-ANN, the WNN-based method is more tolerant to noise and more sensitive to anomalies with temporal dependencies. Furthermore, this approach introduced here can work in a real-time way and will help ocean engineering managers to obtain informed decisions.",oceanology

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this extraction technique is applied to the analysis of UV filters in sand samples, and in other kind of environmental solid samples. Main extraction parameters such as the fibre coating, the amount of sample, the addition of salt, the volume of water added to the sand, and the temperature were optimized. An experimental design approach was implemented in order to find out the most favourable conditions. The final conditions consisted of adding 1 mL of water to 1 g of sample followed by the headspace SPME for 20 min at 100 °C, using PDMS/DVB as fibre coating.

Even with the insufficient training set, the transfer framework can well learn a recognition model for the special underwater object recognition task together with the help of data augmentation. For better identifying objects from an underwater video, a weighted probabilities decision mechanism is introduced to identify the object from a series of frames.

Due to the distinction of system responses for various sea states, four motion signals including surge, sway, roll and yaw are adopted for classification purpose. Firstly, preprocessing techniques, like filtration and k-means clustering are performed to the raw data to filter out the “corrupted” low frequency (LF) information and generate the band-pass filter bank. Then, the processed data is decomposed into 20 categories via Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), filter bank method and wavelet transform and 11 statistical features are extracted for each category. Subsequently, Max-relevance Min-redundancy (mRMR) method helps to select salient features with best trade-off between relevance and redundancy. With these selected features, a newly developed three-layer classification structure with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Random Forest (RF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based combination classifiers is proposed to derive the current sea state.

During the exercise, CTD data have been collected responding to the necessity of a Rapid Environmental Assessment, i.e. to a rapid evaluation of the marine conditions able to provide sensible information for initialisation of modelling tools, in the scenario of possible maritime accidents. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of such mesoscale-resolving CTD observations on short-term forecasts of the surface currents, within the framework of possible oil-spill related emergencies. For this reason, modelling outputs were compared with Lagrangian observations at sea: the high resolution modelled currents, together with the ones of the coarser sub-regional model WMED, are used to force the MEDSLIK-II oil-spill model to simulate drifter trajectories. Both ocean models have been assessed by comparing the prognostic scalar and vector fields as an independent CTD data set and with real drifter trajectories acquired during SG1. The diagnosed and prognosed circulation reveals that the area was characterised by water masses of Atlantic origin influenced by small mesoscale cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies, which govern the spatial and temporal evolution of the drifter trajectories and of the water masses distribution. The assimilation of CTD data into the initial conditions of the high resolution model highly improves the accuracy of the short-term forecast in terms of location and structure of the thermocline and positively influence the ability of the model in reproducing the observed paths of the surface drifters.",oceanology

Therefore, the ship collision risk assessment is of significant importance for ships passing through the narrow, shallow, and busy waterway. In this paper, three ship collision risk indices are initially proposed to quantitatively assess the ship collision risks in the Strait: index of speed dispersion, degree of acceleration and deceleration, and number of fuzzy ship domain overlaps. These three risk indices for the Singapore Strait are estimated by using the real-time ship locations and sailing speeds provide by Lloyd's MIU automatic identification system (AIS). Based on estimation of these three risk indices, it can be concluded that Legs 4W, 5W, 11E, and 12E are the most risky legs in the Strait. Therefore, the ship collision risk reduction solutions should be prioritized being implemented in these four legs. This study also finds that around 25% of the vessels sail with a speed in excess of the speed limit, which results in higher potentials of ship collision. Analysis indicates that the safety level would be significantly improved if all the vessels follow the passage guidelines.",oceanology

This would be useful for those stations where the costly wave buoys are not deployed and instead only meteorological buoys measuring wind are moored. The technique employs alternative artificial intelligence approaches of an artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP) and model tree (MT) to carry out the time series modeling of wind to obtain waves. Wind observations at four offshore sites along the east coast of India were used. For calibration purpose the wave data was generated using a numerical model. The predicted waves obtained using the proposed time series models when compared with the numerically generated waves showed good resemblance in terms of the selected error criteria. Large differences across the chosen techniques of ANN, GP, MT were not noticed.

This approach can be used to accelerate the calculations and improve the accuracy of the parameterizations of several types of physical processes which generally require computations involving complex mathematical expressions, including differential and integral equations, rules, restrictions and highly nonlinear empirical relations based on physical or statistical models. It is shown that, from a mathematical point of view, such parameterizations can usually be considered as continuous mappings (continuous dependencies between two vectors) and, therefore, NNs can be used to replace primary parameterization algorithms. In addition to fast and accurate approximation of the primary parameterization, NN also provides the entire Jacobian for very little computation cost.
                  Four particular real-life applications of the NN approach are presented here: for oceanic numerical models, a NN approximation of the UNESCO equation of state of the sea water (NN for the density of the seawater) and an inversion of this equation (NN for the salinity of the seawater); for atmospheric numerical models, a NN approximation for long wave radiative transfer code; and for wave models, a NN approximation for the nonlinear wave–wave interaction. In all considered applications a significant acceleration of numerical computations has been achieved. The first two of these NN applications have already been implemented in the multi-scale ocean forecast system at NCEP.

Owing to this challenge, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are increasingly gaining more significance as robust strategies for producing more oil volumes from mature reservoirs. Water alternating gas (WAG) injection is an EOR method intended at improving the microscopic and macroscopic displacement efficiencies. To handle and implement successfully this technique, it is of vital importance to optimize its operating parameters. This study targeted at implementing robust proxy paradigms for investigating the suitable design parameters of a WAG project applied to real field data from “Gullfaks” in the North Sea. The proxy models aimed at reducing significantly the rum-time related to the commercial simulators without scarifying the accuracy. To this end, machine learning (ML) approaches, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) were implemented for estimating the needed parameters for the formulated optimization problem. To improve the reliability of these ML methods, they were evolved using optimization algorithms, namely Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) for MLP, and ant colony optimization (ACO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) for RBFNN. The performance analysis of the proxy models revealed that MLP-LMA has better prediction ability than the other two proxy paradigms. In this context, the highest average absolute relative deviation noticed per runs by MLP-LMA was lower than 3.60%. Besides, the best-implemented proxy was coupled with ACO and GWO for resolving the studied WAG optimization problem. The findings revealed that the suggested proxies are cheap, accurate, and practical in emulating the performance of numerical reservoir model.

In rock engineering, features of data play a leading role in determining the feasible methods of its proper manipulation. The present study focuses on resolving one of the major deficiencies of conventional neural networks (NNs) in dealing with rock engineering data. Herein, since the samples are obtained from hundreds of meters below the surface with the utmost difficulty, the number of samples is always limited. Meanwhile, the experimental analysis of these samples may result in many repetitive values and 0s. However, conventional neural networks are incapable of making robust models in the presence of such data. On the other hand, these networks strongly depend on the initial weights and bias values for making reliable predictions. With this in mind, the current research introduces a novel kind of neural network processing framework for the geological that does not suffer from the limitations of the conventional NNs. The introduced single-data-based feature engineering network extracts all the information wrapped in every single data point without being affected by the other points. This method, being completely different from the conventional NNs, re-arranges all the basic elements of the neuron model into a new structure. Therefore, its mathematical calculations were performed from the very beginning. Moreover, the corresponding programming codes were developed in MATLAB and Python since they could not be found in any common programming software at the time being. This new kind of network was first evaluated through computer-based simulations of rock cracks in the 3DEC environment. After the model’s reliability was confirmed, it was adopted in two case studies for estimating respectively tensile strength and shear strength of real rock samples. These samples were coal core samples from the Southern Qinshui Basin of China, and gas hydrate-bearing sediment (GHBS) samples from the Nankai Trough of Japan. The coal samples used in the experiments underwent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging to investigate their original micro and macro fractures. Once done with these experiments, measurement of the rock mechanical properties, including tensile strength, was performed using a rock mechanical test system. However, the shear strength of GHBS samples was acquired through triaxial and direct shear tests. According to the obtained result, the new network structure outperformed the conventional neural networks in both cases of simulation-based and case study estimations of the tensile and shear strength. Even though the proposed approach of the current study originally aimed at resolving the issue of having a limited dataset, its unique properties would also be applied to larger datasets from other subsurface measurements.",oceanology

The WNN was developed without any labeled training data to simulate the non-anomalous behaviors for next-step prediction. The classifying threshold was constructed according to the estimated distribution of long-term historical residual errors. The observation strategy (OS) and prediction strategy (PS) were designed to detect new unknown anomalies. Two types of marine observing time series from a buoy, deployed at the National Ocean Test Site of China, were selected for verifying the method. The results show that 99% of classifying confidence level is adequate to provide a reasonable trade-off between the false negative and false positive. By using the two detecting strategies and selecting proper estimated distribution of the threshold, the method is efficient for identifying the anomalous points and patterns which were caused by the natural factors or equipment failures.

Due to the distinction of system responses for various sea states, four motion signals including surge, sway, roll and yaw are adopted for classification purpose. Firstly, preprocessing techniques, like filtration and k-means clustering are performed to the raw data to filter out the “corrupted” low frequency (LF) information and generate the band-pass filter bank. Then, the processed data is decomposed into 20 categories via Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), filter bank method and wavelet transform and 11 statistical features are extracted for each category. Subsequently, Max-relevance Min-redundancy (mRMR) method helps to select salient features with best trade-off between relevance and redundancy. With these selected features, a newly developed three-layer classification structure with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Random Forest (RF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based combination classifiers is proposed to derive the current sea state.

During the exercise, CTD data have been collected responding to the necessity of a Rapid Environmental Assessment, i.e. to a rapid evaluation of the marine conditions able to provide sensible information for initialisation of modelling tools, in the scenario of possible maritime accidents. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of such mesoscale-resolving CTD observations on short-term forecasts of the surface currents, within the framework of possible oil-spill related emergencies. For this reason, modelling outputs were compared with Lagrangian observations at sea: the high resolution modelled currents, together with the ones of the coarser sub-regional model WMED, are used to force the MEDSLIK-II oil-spill model to simulate drifter trajectories. Both ocean models have been assessed by comparing the prognostic scalar and vector fields as an independent CTD data set and with real drifter trajectories acquired during SG1. The diagnosed and prognosed circulation reveals that the area was characterised by water masses of Atlantic origin influenced by small mesoscale cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies, which govern the spatial and temporal evolution of the drifter trajectories and of the water masses distribution. The assimilation of CTD data into the initial conditions of the high resolution model highly improves the accuracy of the short-term forecast in terms of location and structure of the thermocline and positively influence the ability of the model in reproducing the observed paths of the surface drifters.",oceanology

Polythiophene (PT) was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization in the presence of anhydrous ferric chloride while its polymeric structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). Eventually, the prepared PT was dispersed in an AOT/n-decane solution containing Ag NPs for 1h in which the NPs were adsorbed on the polymer surface.

The unrestricted natural environment makes it a challenging task. We propose a framework to recognize fish from videos captured by underwater cameras deployed in the ocean observation network. First, we extract the foreground via sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition. Then, a deep architecture is used to extract features of the foreground fish images. In this architecture, principal component analysis (PCA) is used in two convolutional layers, followed by binary hashing in the non-linear layer and block-wise histograms in the feature pooling layer. Then spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) is used to extract information invariant to large poses. Finally, a linear SVM classifier is used for the classification. This deep network model can be trained efficiently. On a real-world fish recognition dataset, we achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.64%.",oceanology

While the investigation expands on previously reported feasibility studies of Neural Network Interaction Approximations (NNIA), it focuses on a new robust neural network that is implemented in Wavewatch III (WW3) model. Several idealistic and real test scenarios were carried out. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of NNIA in terms of speeding-up model calculations and is fully capable of providing operationally acceptable model integrations. The ANN is able to emulate the exact nonlinear interaction for single-and multi-modal wave spectra with a much higher accuracy then Discrete Interaction Approximation (DIA). NNIA performs at least twice as fast as DIA and at least two hundred times faster than exact method (Web-Resio-Tracy, WRT) for a well trained dataset. The accuracy of NNIA is network configuration dependent. For most optimal network configurations, the NNIA results and scatter statistics show good agreement with exact results by means of growth curves and integral parameters. Practical possibilities for further improvements in achieving fast and highly accurate emulations using ANN for emulating time consuming exact nonlinear interactions are also suggested and discussed.",oceanology

Therefore, the ship collision risk assessment is of significant importance for ships passing through the narrow, shallow, and busy waterway. In this paper, three ship collision risk indices are initially proposed to quantitatively assess the ship collision risks in the Strait: index of speed dispersion, degree of acceleration and deceleration, and number of fuzzy ship domain overlaps. These three risk indices for the Singapore Strait are estimated by using the real-time ship locations and sailing speeds provide by Lloyd's MIU automatic identification system (AIS). Based on estimation of these three risk indices, it can be concluded that Legs 4W, 5W, 11E, and 12E are the most risky legs in the Strait. Therefore, the ship collision risk reduction solutions should be prioritized being implemented in these four legs. This study also finds that around 25% of the vessels sail with a speed in excess of the speed limit, which results in higher potentials of ship collision. Analysis indicates that the safety level would be significantly improved if all the vessels follow the passage guidelines.",oceanology

Such predictions can be made by using a numerical model or a time series model employing continuously recorded waves. This paper presents another option to do so and it is based on a different time series approach in which the input is in the form of preceding wind speed and wind direction observations. This would be useful for those stations where the costly wave buoys are not deployed and instead only meteorological buoys measuring wind are moored. The technique employs alternative artificial intelligence approaches of an artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP) and model tree (MT) to carry out the time series modeling of wind to obtain waves. Wind observations at four offshore sites along the east coast of India were used. For calibration purpose the wave data was generated using a numerical model. The predicted waves obtained using the proposed time series models when compared with the numerically generated waves showed good resemblance in terms of the selected error criteria. Large differences across the chosen techniques of ANN, GP, MT were not noticed. Wave hindcasting at the same time step and the predictions over shorter lead times were better than the predictions over longer lead times.

There are other techniques in the literature to explore spatial dependency such as regression, Kriging and artificial neural networks. Spatial variability of wave characteristics is also important for ocean wave energy applications. It is shown that significant wave heights at the location of one buoy can be predicted using the neuro-fuzzy approach and the data from adjacent buoys.

Part II: Advancing computational efficiency of environmental numerical models,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0037379613,"A new generic neural network (NN) application—improving computational efficiency of certain processes in numerical environmental models—is considered. This approach can be used to accelerate the calculations and improve the accuracy of the parameterizations of several types of physical processes which generally require computations involving complex mathematical expressions, including differential and integral equations, rules, restrictions and highly nonlinear empirical relations based on physical or statistical models. It is shown that, from a mathematical point of view, such parameterizations can usually be considered as continuous mappings (continuous dependencies between two vectors) and, therefore, NNs can be used to replace primary parameterization algorithms. In addition to fast and accurate approximation of the primary parameterization, NN also provides the entire Jacobian for very little computation cost.
                  Four particular real-life applications of the NN approach are presented here: for oceanic numerical models, a NN approximation of the UNESCO equation of state of the sea water (NN for the density of the seawater) and an inversion of this equation (NN for the salinity of the seawater); for atmospheric numerical models, a NN approximation for long wave radiative transfer code; and for wave models, a NN approximation for the nonlinear wave–wave interaction. In all considered applications a significant acceleration of numerical computations has been achieved. The first two of these NN applications have already been implemented in the multi-scale ocean forecast system at NCEP.
