Especially coastal regions and bays with shallow waters are strongly influenced by tidal dynamics. Meanwhile, in offshore study areas with harsh environmental conditions as well as dynamic ocean currents and water levels, continuous in-situ investigations of the prevailing current conditions requires a high effort. In-situ measurement technology is thereby maintenance-intensive and partly limited in time or space by limited accessibility or restricted by the measurement method. In hence, remote sensing techniques based on video image information, such as Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) for sensing, and computer vision algorithms for long-term investigation of the prevailing dynamic near-surface ocean flow conditions, have become highly relevant. However, in some environmental situations there may be not sufficient or significant natural textures evaluable in the visual camera images, or only insufficient contrast ratio under varying ambient illumination at the water observation site, to perform image based velocimetry. Thus, we consider with this study an extended approach of visual and infrared video data analysis by an automated LSPIV measurement technique under real offshore deployment conditions. The treatise of this paper first introduces the reader to the subject area and technologies as well as the principles of the LSPIV measurement method.

This is due to the non-causal relationship between water elevation and force exerted on a floating body. This study focuses on the use of cascade feedforward neural networks to predict short-term incoming water surface displacements based on recently observed data in real time. Prediction networks are trained with time series data reconstructed from spectral data and recorded time series data from a data buoy deployed off the West Irish Coast. Both training methods are shown to have predictive capabilities with regression coefficients between 0.8–0.9 for a small range of sea states. Both networks prediction accuracies are tested on a large range of sea states as well.

10.1109/JOE.2017.2706100,Comparison of Two Hyperparameter-Free Sparse Signal Processing Methods for Direction-of-Arrival Tracking in the HF97 Ocean Acoustic Experiment,IEEE,Journals,"In this paper, we review and compare the performance of two recently introduced hyperparameter-free sparse signal processing methods namely, the sparse iterative covariance-based estimation method and the sparse Bayesian learning-based relevance vector machine method, for direction-of-arrival (DOA) tracking of multiple signals using an array of sensors. The methods are presented to the readers, in a tutorial style for easy understanding. Hyperparameter-free sparsity-based methods are attractive in practice since tuning of regularization parameters (hyperparameters) is not necessary as they are automatically estimated from the data. The DOA tracking problem is formulated as a snapshot-by-snapshot estimation problem and the implementation of the methods are discussed in detail. A simulation study using a uniform-linear-array is carried out to evaluate the performance of the methods in terms of the root-mean-squared error of the DOA estimates and the probability of resolution with the goal of determining when one is to be preferred over the other. The algorithms are also applied on passive sonar data from the 1997 High-Frequency (HF97) ocean acoustic experiment to demonstrate their usability in a real underwater scenario, as well as their robustness to the modeling assumptions made.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018270,iOceanSee: A Novel Scheme for Ocean State Estimation Using 3D Mobile Convolutional Neural Network,IEEE,Journals,"Ocean state estimation is a basic problem in the field of ocean engineering. Under the trend of data-driven, the development of intelligent ship decision-making, ocean energy system design and other aspects, are inseparable from the estimation of wave parameters in the ocean area. In recent years, researchers have developed remote sensing technology to monitor ocean waves. However, sensor-based methods all have a key limitation, which is high cost and fault worry. More importantly, one major limitation exists in current research: due to lack of change information and relying on a single feature of spatial data, the final predictive results are inaccurate. Adopting a 3D Convolutional Neural Network is a possible solution to improve the detection accuracy. Unfortunately, it cannot be deployed in the ocean environment due to lack of physical network connections. To resolve these issues, we develop a light-weight version of 3D Convolutional Neural Network, namely a low-cost, high-accuracy detection scheme to foresee ocean wave parameters using a 3D Mobile Convolutional Neural Network technique called iOceanSee in the marine environment. iOceanSee employs a mobile terminal composed of low-cost measuring equipment and non-interference (except light) device-an RGB camera to collect video data in real time. It extracts both space and time features through three-dimensional depthwise separable convolutions. More specifically, iOceanSee is able to capture the encoding motion information from multiple adjacent frames of the video, according to which period and height of the waves being evaluated. Our experimental results conclude that iOceanSee obtains comparable performance to 3D Convolutional Neural Network and outperforms other models in terms of measurement accuracy in the marine environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172055/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196998,A Novel Solar Tracker Driven by Waves: From Idea to Implementation,IEEE,Conferences,"Traditional solar trackers often adopt motors to automatically adjust the attitude of the solar panels towards the sun for maximum power efficiency. In this paper, a novel design of solar tracker for the ocean environment is introduced. Utilizing the fluctuations due to the waves, electromagnetic brakes are utilized instead of motors to adjust the attitude of the solar panels. Compared with the traditional solar trackers, the proposed one is simpler in hardware while the harvesting efficiency is similar. The desired attitude is calculated out of the local location and time. Then based on the dynamic model of the system, the angular acceleration of the solar panels is estimated and a control algorithm is proposed to decide the release and lock states of the brakes. In such a manner, the adjustment of the attitude of the solar panels can be achieved by using two brakes only. Experiments are conducted to validate the acceleration estimator and the dynamic model. At last, the feasibility of the proposed solar tracker is tested on the real water surface.

10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636055,A Predictive Control Method for Stabilizing a Manipulator-based UAV Landing Platform on Fluctuating Marine Surface<sup>*</sup>,IEEE,Conferences,"In the process of landing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), a manipulator can be applied to help the UAV land safely and accurately. However, it is a challenge to control the manipulator on a disturbed USV due to joint velocity constraints and bandwidth limitations. To solve this problem, a predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. We leverage a first-order delay system to describe the kinematics of each joint, and control joint velocities by the model predictive controller (MPC). To generate references for MPC, the motion of the floating base needs to be predicted. We apply the recent approach for motion prediction based on the wavelet network (WN) and modify the network to get smooth trajectories. The accuracy of the modified wavelet network (MWN) for motion prediction is tested on four-hour motion data from the real ocean environment and the smoothness of the generated trajectories is also evaluated. Simulations and experiments are implemented to verify the proposed method, the results show that the average control accuracies are improved by more than 30% and 50% in position and rotation compared with the traditional inverse kinematics (IK) controller for 1 Hz base fluctuation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9636055/,2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),27 Sept.-1 Oct. 2021,ieeexplore

Reliable tracking down to 5dB (postprocessing SNR: in a resolution cell) using a 10-frame sliding window is demonstrated, this being 3.5 dB better than the multi-pass grid search.

The Neural Networks (NN) plays the role of automatically estimating the suitable set of PID gains that achieves stability of the system. The NN adjusts online the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error. The performance of the NN-based controller is investigated in ADAMS and MATLAB cooperative simulation.

10.1109/MILCOM.1997.644872,Modular learning strategy for signal detection in a nonstationary environment,IEEE,Conferences,"We describe a novel modular learning strategy for the detection of a target signal of interest in a nonstationary environment, which is motivated by the information preservation rule. The strategy makes no assumptions on the environment. It incorporates three functional blocks: (1) time-frequency analysis, (2) feature extraction, (3) pattern classification, the delineations of which are guided by the information preservation rule. The time-frequency analysis, implemented using the Wigner-Ville distribution, transforms the incoming received signal into a time-frequency image that accounts for the time-varying nature of the received signal's spectral content. This image provides a common input to a pair of channels, one of which is adaptively matched to the interference acting alone, and the other is adaptively matched to the target signal plus interference. Each channel of the receiver consists of a principal components analyser (for feature extraction) followed by a multilayer perceptron (for feature classification), which are implemented using self-organized and supervised forms of learning in feedforward neural networks, respectively. Experimental results, based on real-life radar data, are preserved to demonstrate the superior performance of the new detection strategy over a conventional detector using constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) processing.

10.1109/NAECON.2018.8556744,Onboard Image Processing for Small Satellites,IEEE,Conferences,"In general, the computational ability of spacecraft and satellites has lagged behind terrestrial computers by several generations. Moore's Law turns the supercomputers of yesterday into the laptops of today, but space computing remains relatively underpowered due to the harsh radiation environment and low risk-tolerance of most space missions. Space missions are generally low risk because of the high cost of components and launch. However, launch costs are drastically decreasing and innovations such as CubeSats are changing the risk equation. By accepting more risk and utilizing commercial of the shelf (COTS) parts, it is possible to cheaply build and launch extremely capable computing platforms into space. High performance satellites will be required for advanced interplanetary exploration due to latency challenges. The long transmission times between planets means satellites or robotic explorers need onboard processing to perform tasks in real-time. This paper explores one possible application that could be hosted onboard the next generation of high performance satellites, performing object classification on satellite imagery. Automation of satellite imagery processing is currently performed by servers or workstations on Earth, but this paper will show that those algorithms can be moved onboard satellites by using COTS components. First traditional computer vision techniques such as edge detection and sliding windows are used to detect possible objects on the open ocean. Then a modern neural network architecture is used to classify the object as a ship or not.

Vessels interacting in this DARPA-sponsored Aquaticus mission are grouped into teams consisting of both human and robot counterparts. These teams play a “capture the flag” like game while being required to obey the maritime collision avoidance regulations. This paper is a first step in the field toward evaluating collision avoidance rules in the context of a human or robotic vehicle cheating the COLREGS against its opponent to gain a mission advantage. The problem is representative of interactions likely seen on the open ocean using a combination of autonomous and human-operated multi-vehicle collision avoidance interactions to larger scale maritime vessel traffic interactions operating under COLREGS protocol constraints. The vessels deploy in a distributed collaborative pattern to compete against the opposing team. Upon detection of a violation, the offending vessel(s) are required to complete their penalty actions prior to being allowed to proceed in their mission goal. Human offenders are able to be linked to haptic devices that give real-time feedback using vibrations or similar queuing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559422/,2018 OCEANS - MTS/IEEE Kobe Techno-Oceans (OTO),28-31 May 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308493,Real-Time Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Framework,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently real-time detection, and recognition of an object of interest are becoming vital tasks in visual data processing and computer vision. Various models have been deployed to implement object detection and tracking in multiple fields. However, conventional classifiers are often faced with challenging tasks that visual frames come distorted due to overlapping, camera motion blur, changing subject appearances, and environmental variations. Models using OpenCV-based HAAR feature-based cascade classifiers, without integrating any error minimizing object detection algorithm, were unable to accurately detect an object and track it in a changing environment. Therefore, developing an embedded powerful framework for realtime object detection and recognition becomes more of a vital need for future implementation in various fields. This study presents a powerful technique for a real-time detector that utilizes integrated Deep Learning Neural Networks (DNN) for optimal computational accuracy. Deploying such a framework will ensure the flexibility and reliability of the detector by eliminating the sources of distortion previously mentioned. The model relies on integrating the ImageAI deep learning libraries and You Only Look Once (YOLO-v3) object detection method with a DarkNet53 architecture. The algorithm was trained using the TensorFlow framework to ensure accurate data processing. This paper targets one vital component of our long-term project of developing a multi-agent system, as the proposed model is to be implemented in autonomous agents for the detection of landmines, ocean debris, and wildlife beside environmental scanning missions. In this study the performance of the model has been assessed through detecting and collecting tennis balls as a preliminary test for real-world applications. The model was able to approach the desirable result of surpassing the accuracy of conventional detectors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308493/,2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),1-4 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Two different approaches are presented based on SMOS brightness temperature and SMOS neural network soil moisture data assimilation, respectively. For the first approach, SMOS brightness temperature data assimilation relies on forward modelling. Long term results, spanning the SMOS period, of SMOS forward modelling, monitoring and data assimilation are presented. They emphasize the relevance of SMOS data for monitoring and to support NWP model developments. For the second approach, a SMOS soil moisture product has been produced based on a Neural Network (NN) trained on ECMWF soil moisture. So, the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product captures the SMOS signal variability in time and space, while by design its climatology is consistent with that of the ECMWF soil moisture, which makes it suitable for data assimilation purpose. This approach, initially tested for 2012 in a global scale stand alone approach, shows that SMOS NN data assimilation slightly improves the two-metre air temperature forecast in the short range at regional scale. For NWP applications this approach has been further developed with a near real time production of the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product, with the implementation of the SMOS NN data assimilation in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and with high resolution (9km) global scale testing compatible with the current ECMWF NWP system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8519369/,IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,22-27 July 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761412,Self-tuned PID control based on backpropagation Neural Networks for underwater vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"For a long time, PID-like controllers have been successfully used in academic and industrial tasks. This is thanks to its simplicity and suitable performance in linear or linearized plants, and under certain conditions, in nonlinear ones. A number of PID controller gains tuning approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last decades; most of them off-line techniques. However, in those cases wherein plants are subject to continuous parametric changes or external disturbances, online gains tuning is a need. This is the case of modular underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) where parameters (weight, buoyancy, added mass, among others) change according to the tool they are fitted with. In practice, some amount of time is dedicated to tune the PID gains of a ROV. Once the best set of gains has been achieved the ROV is ready to work. However, when the vehicle changes its tool or it is subject to ocean currents, its performance deteriorates since the fixed set of gains is no longer valid for the new conditions. Thus, an online PID gains tuning algorithm should be implemented to overcome this problem. In this paper, an auto-tuned PID-like controller based on Neural Networks (NN) is proposed. The NN plays the role of automatically estimating the suitable set of PID gains that achieves stability of the system. The NN adjusts online the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error. Simulation results are given considering an underactuated 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) underwater ROV. Real time experiments on an underactuated mini ROV are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7761412/,OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey,19-23 Sept. 2016,ieeexplore

In particular, we focus on convoying and passive communication for radio-denied environments by using whole-body gestures to provide cues regarding future actions. We develop a communication protocol whereby information described by codewords is transmitted by a series of actions executed by a swimming robot. These action sequences are chosen to optimize robustness and transmission duration given the observability, natural activity of the robot and the frequency of different messages. Our approach uses a convolutional network to make core observations of the pose of the robot being tracked, which is sending messages. The observer robot then uses an adaptation of classical decoding methods to infer a message that is being transmitted. The system is trained and validated using simulated data, tested in the pool and is targeted for deployment in the open ocean.

These data can be used in the design of intelligent systems to predict and measure properties of the marine environment. One environmental factor that is very important to maritime transportation and safety is sea state, that is, the ""roughness"" of the sea surface. Sea state is dependent on winds, but can vary significantly with location and over time, based on a wide range of factors. We show how publicly available sensor data can be used to detect and predict local sea state. To do this, we will discuss various techniques that can help us deal with a large set of echo sounder data, and aggregate it in a way that allows basic machine learning techniques to categorize the local sea state at a given time according to the Douglas Sea Scale.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7300859/,2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud,24-26 Aug. 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020530,A Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller for Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles With Disturbance Rejection,IEEE,Journals,"Remotely Operated underwater Vehicles (ROVs) are growing in importance in the ocean environment for observation and manipulation tasks, particularly when used to maintain offshore energy and offshore renewable energy assets. Many such tasks require the dynamic positioning of ROV in challenging sea conditions with multiple disturbances resulting from the effects of waves, currents and turbulence. This work presents a novel, nonlinear, model predictive dynamic positioning controller that accounts for such complex stochastic disturbances. These external disturbances are modelled as 6-degree of freedom forces and moments within the nonlinear ROV dynamic and propulsion model. A nonlinear model predictive dynamic positioning strategy based on the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed for the disturbance rejection in this work. A numerical water tank model is used to test the performance of the strategy using hardware in-the-loop simulation. The results of the simulation have been compared against baseline proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controllers tested under wave and current conditions in the FloWave basin. A quantitative comparison of the controllers is presented. The resulting controller is shown to maintain a small root mean squared error (RMSE) in position when subjected to multiple directional disturbance, with minimal control effort.

In this scheme, pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN)-based image enhancement and color transfer algorithms are combined to enhance the underwater image. To avoid color imbalance in the underwater image and enhance details while suppressing noise, color correction is first carried out on the underwater image before converting it into the hue-saturation-intensity domain and enhancing it by PCNN. The enhanced result improves the color and contrast of the source image and enhances the details and edges of darker regions.

The methods are presented to the readers, in a tutorial style for easy understanding. Hyperparameter-free sparsity-based methods are attractive in practice since tuning of regularization parameters (hyperparameters) is not necessary as they are automatically estimated from the data. The DOA tracking problem is formulated as a snapshot-by-snapshot estimation problem and the implementation of the methods are discussed in detail. A simulation study using a uniform-linear-array is carried out to evaluate the performance of the methods in terms of the root-mean-squared error of the DOA estimates and the probability of resolution with the goal of determining when one is to be preferred over the other. The algorithms are also applied on passive sonar data from the 1997 High-Frequency (HF97) ocean acoustic experiment to demonstrate their usability in a real underwater scenario, as well as their robustness to the modeling assumptions made.

USVs can either be deployed as a single unit or multiple vehicles in a fleet to conduct ocean missions. Central to the control of USV and USV formations, path planning is the key technology that ensures the navigation safety by generating collision free trajectories. Compared with conventional path planning algorithms, the deep reinforcement learning (RL) based planning algorithms provides a new resolution by integrating a high-level artificial intelligence. This work investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for USV and USV formation path planning with specific focus on a reliable obstacle avoidance in constrained maritime environments. For single USV planning, with the primary aim being to calculate a shortest collision avoiding path, the designed RL path planning algorithm is able to solve other complex issues such as the compliance with vehicle motion constraints. The USV formation maintenance algorithm is capable of calculating suitable paths for the formation and retain the formation shape robustly or vary shapes where necessary, which is promising to assist with the navigation in environments with cluttered obstacles.

10.1109/TITS.2017.2681810,Maritime Traffic Probabilistic Forecasting Based on Vessels’ Waterway Patterns and Motion Behaviors,IEEE,Journals,"Maritime traffic prediction is critical for ocean transportation safety management. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge assisted methodology for maritime traffic forecasting based on a vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior. The vessel's waterway pattern is extracted through a proposed lattice-based DBSCAN algorithm that significantly reduces the problem scale, and its motion behavior is quantitatively modeled for the first time using kernel density estimation. The proposed methodology facilitates the knowledge extraction, storage, and retrieval, allowing for seamless knowledge transfer to support maritime traffic forecasting. By incorporating both the vessel's waterway pattern and motion behavior knowledge, our solution suggests a set of probable coordinates with the corresponding probability as the forecasting output. The proposed forecasting algorithm is capable of accurately predicting maritime traffic 5, 30, and 60 min ahead, while its computation can be efficiently completed in milliseconds for single vessel prediction. Owing to such a high computational efficiency, an extensive predictive analysis of hundreds of vessels has been reported for the first time in this paper.

10.1109/78.600003,Modular learning strategy for signal detection in a nonstationary environment,IEEE,Journals,"We describe a novel modular learning strategy for the detection of a target signal of interest in a nonstationary environment, which is motivated by the information preservation rule. The strategy makes no assumptions on the environment. It incorporates three functional blocks: (1) time-frequency analysis, (2) feature extraction, and (3) pattern classification, the delineations of which are guided by the information preservation rule. The time-frequency analysis, which is implemented using the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), transforms the incoming received signal into a time-frequency image that accounts for the time-varying nature of the received signal's spectral content. This image provides a common input to a pair of channels, one of which is adaptively matched to the interference acting alone, and the other is adaptively matched to the target signal plus interference. Each channel of the receiver consists of a principal components analyzer (for feature extraction) followed by a multilayer perceptron (for feature classification), which are implemented using self-organized and supervised forms of learning in feedforward neural networks, respectively. Experimental results based on real-life radar data are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the new detection strategy over a conventional detector using constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) processing.

Under the trend of data-driven, the development of intelligent ship decision-making, ocean energy system design and other aspects, are inseparable from the estimation of wave parameters in the ocean area. In recent years, researchers have developed remote sensing technology to monitor ocean waves. However, sensor-based methods all have a key limitation, which is high cost and fault worry. More importantly, one major limitation exists in current research: due to lack of change information and relying on a single feature of spatial data, the final predictive results are inaccurate. Adopting a 3D Convolutional Neural Network is a possible solution to improve the detection accuracy. Unfortunately, it cannot be deployed in the ocean environment due to lack of physical network connections. To resolve these issues, we develop a light-weight version of 3D Convolutional Neural Network, namely a low-cost, high-accuracy detection scheme to foresee ocean wave parameters using a 3D Mobile Convolutional Neural Network technique called iOceanSee in the marine environment. iOceanSee employs a mobile terminal composed of low-cost measuring equipment and non-interference (except light) device-an RGB camera to collect video data in real time. It extracts both space and time features through three-dimensional depthwise separable convolutions. More specifically, iOceanSee is able to capture the encoding motion information from multiple adjacent frames of the video, according to which period and height of the waves being evaluated.
