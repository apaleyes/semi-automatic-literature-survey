More precisely, it is a method of developing sustainable, intelligent manufacturing systems for attaining robust quality, reducing time, and customized products using real-time information throughout the product life cycle. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 98 research papers on various digital supply chain twin dimensions with sustainable performance objectives. The selected papers were reviewed and classified into three broad categories: components of the digital twin, applications in the manufacturing supply chain, and sustainability. Based on the review and future perspectives from the study, we suggest that advancements in technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and blockchain have increased the potential of digital twin applications in the supply chain. The results indicate that a digital supply chain twin should include the things and humans from the entire supply chain and not be restricted to the local manufacturing systems. Based on our review findings, we present a sustainable digital twin implementation framework for supply chains. The proposed framework will guide future practitioners and researchers.",e-commerce

On the other hand, high latencies and poor availability will cost businesses their customers due customers dissatisfaction, thus losing customers to competitors. This situation noticeable in e-commerce businesses where real-time response and decision making within seconds are critical for business service delivery. Therefore, latency and availability are important parameters in the Service Level Agreement for cloud users when choosing Cloud Services Providers (CSPs). But the challenge for businesses is that they do not have their in–house mechanism that can accurately predict the required latency and availability for their requirements. Companies only rely on the CSPs tools for estimating resource requirements, which is biased towards the CSPs business model. In this paper, we developed a deep learning algorithm that predicts the latency and availability of cloud services using real-time live data from three CSPs. We designed and implemented experiments on Amazon Web Services, Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications to run compute instances across the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In each cloud platform, five servers were used that resulted in 30,815,100 invocations of http and ping operations for 6 weeks. The algorithm used the data on hourly, daily and weekly basis as historical network data to predict latency and availability. We used MATLABs deep learning toolbox for the implementation of our algorithm and the results showed that the prediction is usually above 90% accurate as compared with the data obtained. The results also revealed that latency performance depends on the locations of users and the availability depends on number of availability zones used.",e-commerce

Based on this, this paper combines the data preprocessing technology of fuzzy membership and optimized deep learning algorithm, adding a self-encoding method with sparseness restriction, and proposes a deep learning sales forecasting model based on transformative computing with fuzzy membership-the super crown model (Super Imperial Crown Model, referred to as SICM). The model uses fuzzy membership to process the weighted relationship between sales influencing factors and sales rank, and uses a sparse autoencoder network to adaptively extract sample features; sales rank classification prediction uses Softmax classifier; BP fine-tuning is used to Achieve parameter optimization. Finally, use the collected transaction data to apply R software to simulate the optimized model and compare and analyze the comprehensive prediction performance. The results show that the super crown model can realize real-time and accurate dynamic sales classification prediction according to the characteristics of current online agricultural product transaction data, effectively overcome the imbalance of supply and demand caused by information imbalance, and promote the study of deep learning in the field of e-commerce transactions effect.

This paper focuses on two challenges traditional GNN frameworks face: (i) most of them are transductive and mainly concentrate on homogeneous networks considering single typed nodes and edges; (ii) they are difficult to handle the real-time changing network structures as well as scale to big graph data. To address these issues, a novel attention-based Heterogeneous Multi-view Graph Neural Network (aHMGNN) solution is introduced. aHMGNN models a more intricate heterogeneous multi-view network, where various node and edge types co-exist and each of these objects also contain specific attributes. It is end-to-end, and two stages are designed for node embeddings learning and multi-typed node and edge representations fusion, respectively. Experimental studies on large-scale spam detection and link prediction tasks clearly verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed aHMGNN. Furthermore, we have implemented our approach in one of the largest e-commerce platforms which further verifies that aHMGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications.",e-commerce

Moreover, many studies have shown that with the assistance of Mobile Augmented Reality, retailers have the potential to significantly improve their sales. However, the effects of Mobile AR on consumer impulse buying behavior have yet to be examined, particularly in the tourism field. Consequently, the present study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) framework, and flow theory to examine the effects of Mobile AR apps on tourist impulse buyingbehavior. The research model is implemented using an online questionnaire, with the results analyzed by Partial-Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The results obtained from 479 valid samples show that the characteristics of Mobile AR apps play an important role in governing tourist behavior in making unplanned purchases. In particular, as the utility, ease-of-use, and interactivity of the apps increase, the perceived enjoyment and satisfaction of the user also increase and give rise to a stronger impulse buying behavior. The results also reveal a mediating effect of the flow experience on the relationship between the perceived ease of use of the Mobile AR app and the user satisfaction in using the app. Overall, the findings presented in this study provide a useful source of reference for Mobile AR app developers, retailers, and tourism marketers in better understanding users' preferences for Mobile AR apps and strengthening their impulse buying behavior in the tourism context as a result.",e-commerce

Nowadays, most IMs take place on mobile applications, such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber and Facebook Messenger, which have more users than social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. Among the applications of IMs, online shopping has become a part of our everyday life, primarily those who are busiest. However, transaction disputes are often occurred online shopping. Since most IMs are centralized and message history is not stored in the center, the messaging between users and owners of online shops are not reliable and traceable. In China, online shopping sales have soared from practically zero in 2003 to nearly 600 hundred million dollars last year, and now top those in the United States. It is very crucial to secure the instant messaging in online shopping in China. We present techniques to exploit blockchain and machine learning algorithms to secure instant messaging. Since the cryptography of Chinese national standard is encouraged to adopt in security applications of China, we propose a blockchain-based IM scheme with the Chinese cryptographic bases. First, we design a message authentication model based on SM2 to avoid the counterfeit attack and replay attack. Second, we design a cryptographic hash mode based on SM3 to verify the integrity of message. Third, we design a message encryption model based on SM4 to protect the privacy of users. Besides, we propose a method based on machine learning algorithms to monitor the activity on blockchain to detect anomaly. To prove and verify the blockchain-based IM scheme, a blockchain-based IM system has been designed on Linux platforms. The implementation result shows that it is a practical and secure IM system, which can be applied to a variety of instant messaging applications directly.",e-commerce

This paper proposes a multi-view model, namely, Deep Multi-view Information iNtEgration (Deep-MINE), to take multiple sources of content (i.e., product images, descriptions and review texts) into account and design an end-to-end recommendation model. In doing so, stacked auto-encoder networks are deployed to map multi-view information into a unified latent space, a cognition layer is added to depict consumers' heterogeneous cognition styles and an integration module is introduced to reflect the interaction of multi-view latent representations.

Instead of bank/shop robbery, nowadays, criminals try to find their victims in the cyberspace with some specific tricks. By using the anonymous structure of the Internet, attackers set out new techniques, such as phishing, to deceive victims with the use of false websites to collect their sensitive information such as account IDs, usernames, passwords, etc. Understanding whether a web page is legitimate or phishing is a very challenging problem, due to its semantics-based attack structure, which mainly exploits the computer users’ vulnerabilities. Although software companies launch new anti-phishing products, which use blacklists, heuristics, visual and machine learning-based approaches, these products cannot prevent all of the phishing attacks. In this paper, a real-time anti-phishing system, which uses seven different classification algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) based features, is proposed. The system has the following distinguishing properties from other studies in the literature: language independence, use of a huge size of phishing and legitimate data, real-time execution, detection of new websites, independence from third-party services and use of feature-rich classifiers. For measuring the performance of the system, a new dataset is constructed, and the experimental results are tested on it. According to the experimental and comparative results from the implemented classification algorithms, Random Forest algorithm with only NLP based features gives the best performance with the 97.98% accuracy rate for detection of phishing URLs.",e-commerce

This interest is further fueled by the emergence of e-commerce, where many applications can benefit from autonomous package delivery solutions. However, the environment stochasticity, variability and task complexity for autonomous operation make it difficult to deploy such systems in real-world applications without the incorporation of advanced machine learning and optimization algorithms. Moving away from designing a “one size fits all” agent to solve the outdoor package delivery problem and considering ad-hoc teams of agents trained within a data-driven framework could provide the answer. In this work, we propose a delivery scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) formulation. Specifically, a 3-index mixed integer program-based PDP that allows coalition formation (PDP-CF) among agents is derived to allow multi-agent PDP schedules. We propose a quantum genetic algorithm to solve for the schedule since it is can better handle the large computational complexity of PDP-CF.

In doing so, first of all, a time-aware review consistency ranking (TRCR) problem is formulated, based on a newly defined metric, which aims to derive a compact review list with maximized expected consistency degree to the original review set. Furthermore, this problem is proven to be NP-hard, which leads us to developing an effective approximation by heuristically restricting the search space (i.e., TRCRea). This proposed method with related improvements show strengths on two aspects: one is that the informational decay of the reviews is well addressed at both macro and micro levels; and the other is that the compact review list provided to the consumers is obtained from a combined perspective of consistency and time-awareness in light of product features and sentiment orientations.

Firstly, the Gaussian Mixture Model method is applied for data partitioning on historical observations. While the antecedent part of the neuro-fuzzy system of AnYa type is initialised by the partitioning result, the consequent part is trained using the fuzzily weighted RLS algorithm based on the same data.

Unfortunately, almost all of the existing approaches adopt black box models and mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts. Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited Internet banking data availability for the scientific community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision support system for online banking fraud analysis and investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies the anomaly of each transaction with respect to the customer historical profile. Second, it finds global clusters of customers with similar spending habits. Third, it uses a temporal threshold system that measures the anomaly of the current spending pattern of each customer, with respect to his or her past spending behavior. With this threefold profiling approach, it mitigates the under-training due to the lack of historical data for building well-trained profiles, and the evolution of users' spending habits over time. At runtime, BankSealer supports analysts by ranking new transactions that deviate from the learned profiles, with an output that has an easily understandable, immediate statistical meaning.
                  Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical, real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing, banking trojan activity, and frauds repeated over time), shows that our approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, we measure the effectiveness, the computational resource requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to mitigate the problem of users that performed a low number of transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with up to 98% detection rate and with a maximum daily computation time of 4 min.

Previous testing has shown that asymmetric GARCH models outperform other GARCH family models with regard to volatility prediction. Utilizing this information, three popular Neural Network models (Feed-Forward with Back Propagation, Generalized Regression, and Radial Basis Function) are implemented to help improve the performance of the GJR(1,1) method for estimating volatility over the next forty-four trading days. During training and testing, four different economic cycles have been considered between 1997-2011 to represent real and contemporary periods of market calm and crisis. In addition to stress testing for different neural network architectures to assess their performance under various turmoil and normal situations in the U.S. market, their synergy along with another econometric model is also accessed.",e-commerce

To maintain these levels of trust they have been forced to make significant adjustments to economic structures, in efforts to recoup their investments and maintain the loyalty of their customers. To achieve these objectives, the implementation of electronic banking for customers has been considered a successful strategy. The use of electronic banking in Spain in the last decade has been fostered due to its many advantages, giving rise to real integration of channels in financial institutions. This paper reviews different methods and techniques to determine which variables could be the most important to financial institutions in order to predict the likely levels of trust among electronic banking users including socio-demographic, economic, financial and behavioural strategic variables that entities have in their databases. To do so, the most recent advances in machine learning and soft-computing have been used, including a new selection operator for multiobjective genetic algorithms. The results obtained by the algorithms were validated by an expert committee, ranking the quality of them. The new methodology proposed, obtained the best results in terms of optimisation as well as the highest punctuation given by the experts.",e-commerce

Current collaborative filtering techniques such as correlation-based, SVD-based and supervised learning-based approaches provide good accuracy, but are computationally very expensive and can only be deployed in static off-line settings, where the known rating information does not change with time. However, a number of practical scenarios require dynamic adaptive collaborative filtering that can allow new users, items and ratings to enter the system at a rapid rate. In this paper, we consider a novel adaptive personalized recommendation based on adaptive learning. Fast adaptive learning runs through all the aspects of the proposed approach, including training, prediction and updating. Empirical evaluation of our approach on Movielens dataset demonstrates that it is possible to obtain accuracy comparable to that of the correlation-based, SVD-based and supervised learning-based approaches at a much lower computational cost.",e-commerce

Determining the theoretical price for an option, or option pricing, is regarded as one of the most important issues in financial research; a number of parametric and nonparametric option pricing approaches have been presented. While the objective of option pricing is to find the current fair price, for decision making, in contrast, the forecasting activity has to accurately predict the future option price without advance knowledge of the underlying asset price. In this paper, a simple and effective nonparametric method of forecasting option prices based on neural networks (NNs) and support vector regressions (SVRs) is presented. We first modified the improved conventional option pricing methods, allowing them to forecast the option prices. Second, we employed the NNs and SVRs to further decrease the forecasting errors of the parametric methods. Since the conventional methods mimic the trends of movement of the real option prices, using these methods in a first stage allows the NNs and SVRs to concentrate their power in nonlinear curve approximation to further reduce the forecasting errors in a second stage. Finally, extensive experimental studies with data from the Hong Kong option market demonstrated the ability of NNs and SVRs to improve forecast accuracy.",e-commerce

To utilize these web services effectively, customer's have to (a) locate each of these services from service directories and retrieve brief service descriptions, (b) analyze service features and evaluate their applicability to the task at hand dynamically, and finally (c) invoke these services in a certain sequence to complete an overall business or personal need. Alternatively, intermediaries execute the aforementioned steps manually and provide a composite service for access from a single service platform. Both these approaches are highly tedious (either for the customer or intermediary) and non-scalable due to the volatility and size of the web. The dynamic nature of the availability and features of web services, real-time requirements on service composition and the large number of alternative combinations of service choices to fulfill a service need makes major demands on the service composition process.
                  This paper presents a novel declarative approach to facilitate dynamic and scalable web service composition called Integrated Service Planning and Execution (ISP&E) based on AI planning techniques. Implementation of an architecture for dynamic web service composition and execution based on a domain-independent AI planning framework called Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is described in this paper. Simulated experiments highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach which interleaves service composition and execution, to cope with dynamic service capabilities and service volatility.",e-commerce

With recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques, incidental finding of liver tumors, or “incidentalomas,” is increasing in asymptomatic and healthy individuals. However, little information is available in the literature regarding the underlying pathology and operative outcomes after hepatic resection. Between January 1989 and December 2002, 1011 patients underwent hepatic resection for liver tumors; of these patients, 107 (11%) were asymptomatic individuals who presented with incidentalomas. Incidentalomas were first detected on percutaneous ultrasonography (n=83), computed tomography (n=23), or magnetic resonance imaging (n=1). Fifteen (14%) patients had preoperative aspiration for cytology or biopsy for histology, and the results correlated with the final pathology in 12 patients. Fifty-six (52%) patients underwent major hepatic resection with resection of three or more Coiunaud's segments. Median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days (range, 3–66 days). The operative mortality rate was 1%, and the operative morbidity rate was 21%. Histologic examination of the resected specimen revealed malignant liver tumors in 62 (58%) patients, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n=48), cholangiocarcinoma (n=8), lymphoma (n=2), cystadenocarcinoma (n=2), carcinoid tumor (n=1), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n=1). Benign pathologies were found in 45 (42%) patients, including focal nodular hyperplasia (n=17), hemangioma (n=12), angiomyolipoma (n=5), cirrhotic regenerative nodule (n=4), hepatic adenoma (n=2), and others (n=5). On multivariate analysis, male sex, age of greater than 50 years, and tumor size of greater than 4 cm were the independent predictive factors for malignant diseases. On retrospective analysis, 48 patients with HCC who presented with incidentalomas had significantly better survival outcomes after hepatic resection than did 646 patients with HCC who presented otherwise during the same study period. Hepatic resection for patients with incidentalomas is associated with a low operative mortality and acceptable morbidity. The diagnosis of malignant disease, especially HCC, should be considered in male patients older than 50 years who present with large hepatic lesions.",e-commerce

For example, comparison-shopping agents mediate the interactions between buyers and sellers in order to yield more efficient markets. However, today's shopping agents are price-dominated, unreflective of the nature of seller/buyer differentiation or the changing course of differentiation over time. This paper aims to tackle this dilemma and advances shopping agents into a stage where both kinds of differentiation are taken into account for enhanced understanding of the realities. We call them next-generation shopping agents. These agents can leverage the interactive power of the Web for more accurate understanding of buyer's preferences. This paper then presents an architecture of the next-generation shopping agents. This architecture is composed of a Product/Merchant Information Collector, a Buyer Behavior Extractor, a User Profile Manager and an Online Learning Personalized-Ranking Module. We have implemented a system following the core of the architecture and collected preliminary evaluation results. The results show this system is quite promising in overcoming the reality challenges of comparison shopping.",e-commerce
