479005964,2021-10-21T00:00:00,"In recent years, institutions operating in the global market economy face
growing risks stemming from non-financial risk factors such as cyber,
third-party, and reputational outweighing traditional risks of credit and
liquidity. Adverse media or negative news screening is crucial for the
identification of such non-financial risks. Typical tools for screening are not
real-time, involve manual searches, require labor-intensive monitoring of
information sources. Moreover, they are costly processes to maintain up-to-date
with complex regulatory requirements and the institution's evolving risk
appetite.
  In this extended abstract, we present an automated system to conduct both
real-time and batch search of adverse media for users' queries (person or
organization entities) using news and other open-source, unstructured sources
of information. Our scalable, machine-learning driven approach to
high-precision, adverse news filtering is based on four perspectives -
relevance to risk domains, search query (entity) relevance, adverse sentiment
analysis, and risk encoding. With the help of model evaluations and case
studies, we summarize the performance of our deployed application.Comment: accepted at: Workshop on Machine Learning in Finance, KDD 2020,

29194283,,"The financial industry is witnessing major changes. The financial enterprise is undergoing major business process renewal accompanied with the introduction of new technologies including electronic commerce; the financial market is shifting from an old to a new trading model that introduces major structural changes to the market and new roles for market participants; investment offers access to ever larger repositories of financial information and a wider choice of financial instruments to fulfill rising needs and expectations. In all these developments, there is a central role for human intelligence that can potentially influence the pattern of change and direct appropriate decisions in adapting to change. There is also a vital need for computer-based technology to support this human activity. 



The relation between human and computer activities in classical models for computer-based support is characterised by rigidity and framed patterns of interaction. The emphasis in such models is on automation, not only in respect of routine trading operations, but even of the role of market participants. An alternative culture is emerging through the use of advanced technologies incorporating databases, spreadsheets, virtual reality, multi-media and AI. There is an urgent need for a framework in which to unify the classical culture, in which mathematical financial modelling has a central place, with the emerging culture, where there is greater emphasis upon human interaction and experiential aspects of computer use. This thesis addresses the problem of developing software that takes into account the human factor, the integration of the social and technical aspects, human insight, the experiential and situated aspects, different viewpoints of analysis, a holistic rather than an abstract view of the domain of study, cognitive rather than operational activities, and group social interaction. The ultimate aspiration for this work is to transform the computer as it is used in finance from an advanced calculator to an 'instrument of mind'. 



Meeting the challenges of software support for finance is not only a matter of deployment, but also of software system development (SSD): this motivates our focus on the potential applications and prospects for an Empirical Modelling (EM) approach to SSD in finance. EM technology is a suite of principles, techniques, notations, and tools. EM is a form of situated modelling that involves the construction of artefacts that stand in a special relationship to the modeller's understanding and the situation. The modelling activity is rooted in observation and experiment, and exploits the key concepts of observables, dependencies and agency. The thesis extends the major findings of Sun (1999), in respect of the essential character of SSD, and its contextual and social aspects, by considering its particular application to the finance domain. 



The principles and qualities of EM as an approach to SSD are first introduced and illustrated with reference to a review of relevant existing models. The suitability of EM as a framework for SSD in finance is then discussed with reference to case studies drawn from the finance domain (the financial enterprise, the financial market, and investment). In particular, EM contributes: principles for software integration and virtual collaboration in the financial enterprise; a novel modelling approach adapting to the new trading model in the financial market; computer-based support for distributed financial engineering; and principles for a closer integration of the software system development and financial research development activities. This contribution is framed in a Situated Integration Model, a Human Information Behaviour Model, an Open Financial Market Model, a framework for distributed financial engineering, and a situated account of the financial research development cycle",,An empirical modelling approach to software system development in finance : applications and prospects,https://core.ac.uk/download/29194283.pdf,,,core
100338454,2014-12-12,"Summary. Trading “profits ” can be obtained by luck or by the implementation of a superior trading strategy. In this chapter we discuss the difficulties of distinguishing between the two. First, a suitable characterization of profit that distinguishes between trading gains and market gains is required. Secondly, one needs to be able to characterize trading “strategies”. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of a genotype-phenotype map to finance, where the genotype is as-sociated with the information set and associated decision rules that lead to a given set of trading decisions for a given trader, while the phenotype is described by the set of observable trading de-cisions themselves. In AI based systems, such as agent-based markets, a strategy is implemented algorithmically and so the genotype is explicitly known. In real markets however, the genotypic trading strategy of one trader is hidden from the rest. The phenotype however, is, in principle, observable. A microscopic description at the level of the set of individual trades, however, is not sufficient to understand or characterize the strategies at a more macroscopic and intuitive one. By introducing a set of coarse grained variables that can be used to classify strategy types, we show how these variables can then be data mined to understand what differs between an intelligent and a lucky strategy. We show that these variables can be used to distinguish between different strat-egy types and can be further used to infer the presence of learning and adaptation in the market. We illustrate all of the above using data from an experimental political market. 6.",,"6 Who’s Smart and Who’s Lucky?

390009409,2020-02-20T00:00:00,"Computer vision is used in recognition, identification, identification, analysis of images. But the disadvantage of advanced software is that it does not perceive the surrounding world as a person. Smart machines cannot yet see, but can learn, like the formation of neural connections inthe human brain. The relevance of the study of human face recognition methods is manifested due to the popularity of human image processing and the need to improve human interaction and technology.The result of the research is to determine the advantages and disadvantages of existing systems and methods, as well as simplifying the process of recognizing a person's face in images and increasing indicators when recognizing using the convolutional neural network method. The resulting system based on neural network methods makes a decision similarly to humans. To make a decision, this system needs information about the object, which is received at the entrance bytracking the special properties of the object. When a person is the object under investigation, the most special properties can be obtained by tracking his personality. In this case, the system has todeal with sometimes low-quality images, noise, angles of the head position, poor lighting and the like. Accuracy and speed criteria are factors in the success of a face recognition system. Theoriginal product shows improved recognition rates.Studies have shown the versatility of neural networks and their effectiveness in solving problems of facial recognition in real time and in photography. The system of automatic tracking and recognition of a person’s face using artificial intelligence and convolutional neural networks can be used at checkpoints, customs control, for identification in banking systems, government institutions, educational institutions (attendance control, registration of passers-by of unauthorized persons in the premises, identification personswhen writing control or examination papers).Компьютерное зрение применяется при распознавании, идентификации, выявлении, анализе изображения. Но недостатком продвинутого программного обеспечения является то, что оно не воспринимает окружающий мир как человек. Умные машины пока не могут видеть, но могут учиться, подобно формированию нейронных связей в мозгу человека. Актуальность исследования методов распознавания лица человека проявляется из-за популярности обработки изображения человека и необходимости улучшениявзаимодействия человека и технологий. Результатом исследований является определение преимуществ и недостатков существующих систем и методов, а также упрощение процесса распознавания лицачеловека на изображениях и повышение показателей при распознавании с помощью метода сверточных нейронных сетей. Полученная система на основе нейросетевых методовпринимает решение аналогично человеку. Для принятия решения данной системе необходима информация об объекте, которую получают на входе благодаря отслеживаниюособых свойств объекта. Когда исследуемым объектом является человек, наиболее особые свойства можно получить благодаря отслеживанию его личности. При этом системе приходится иметь дело с иногда некачественными изображениями, шумом, ракурсамиположения головы, плохим освещением и тому подобное.  Критерии точности и скорости являются факторами успешной работы системы распознавания лица. Исходный продукт показывает улучшенные показатели распознавания. Проведенные исследования показали универсальность нейронных сетей и их эффективность в решении задач распознавания лица человека в реальном времени и по фотографии. Система автоматического отслеживания и распознавания лица человека с использованием искусственного интеллекта и сверточных нейронных сетей может быть использована в контрольно-пропускных пунктах, таможенном контроле, дляидентификации в банковских системах, государственных  учреждениях, учебных заведениях (контроль посещаемости, учет проходимости посторонних лиц в помещениях, идентификация лица при написании контрольных или экзаменационных работ).Комп'ютерний зір застосовується при розпізнаванні, ідентифікації, виявленні, аналізу зображення. Але недоліком просунутого програмного забезпечення є те, що воно не сприймає навколишній світ як людина. Найрозумніші машини поки що не можуть бачити,але можуть навчатися, подібно формуванню нейронних зв’язків у мозку людини. Актуальність дослідження методів розпізнавання обличчя людини проявляється через популярність обробки зображення людини та необхідність покращення взаємодії людини і технологій. Результатом досліджень є визначення переваг та недоліків існуючих систем та методів, а також спрощення процесу розпізнавання обличчя людини на зображеннях та підвищення показників при розпізнаванні за допомогою методу згорткових нейронних мереж. Отримана система на основі нейромережевих методів приймає рішення аналогічно людині. Для прийняття рішення даній системі необхідна інформація про об’єкт, яку отримують на вході завдяки відстеженню особливих властивостей об’єкта. Коли досліджуваним об’єктом є людина, найбільш особливі властивості можна одержати завдяки відстеженню його особи. При цьому системі доводиться мати справу з інодінеякісними зображеннями, шумом, ракурсами положення голови, погане освітлення і тощо. Критерії точності та швидкості є факторами успішної роботи системи розпізнавання обличчя. Вихідний продукт показує поліпшені показники розпізнавання. Проведені дослідження показали універсальність нейронних мереж та їх ефективність у вирішенні задач розпізнавання обличчя людини у реальному часі та по фотографії. Систему автоматичного відстеження та розпізнавання обличчя людини із використанням штучного інтелекту та згорткових нейронних мереж може бути використано в контрольно-пропускних пунктах, митному контролі, для ідентифікації у банківських системах, державних установах, навчальних закладах (контроль відвідуваності,облік проходимості сторонніх осіб у приміщеннях, ідентифікація особи при написанні контрольних або екзаменаційних робіт)",ДВНЗ «Приазовський державний технічний університет»,ДОСЛІДЖЕННЯ ВИКОРИСТАННЯ МЕТОДІВ РОЗПІЗНАВАННЯ ОБЛИЧЧЯ ЛЮДИНИ В СИСТЕМАХ ІДЕНТИФІКАЦІЇ,,,,core

Also it is shown the possibility of securing wireless applications that use mobile agents and distributed computing. Wireless networks are a relatively new technology in the LAN market. With the weak encryption and security defined in the IEEE standards, wireless LANs, when improperly deployed or administered, can provide a significant risk to those economic sectors. These sectors include health-care, government, and banking in particular. Increasingly diverse heterogeneous wireless infrastructures in combination with more narrowly defined roles of parties participating in the delivery of applications to mobile users pose new challenges for support for delivering these applications.

162132342,2018-05-23T00:00:00,"Dissertação (mestrado)—Universidade de Brasília, Faculdade de Tecnologia, Departamento de Engenharia Elétrica, 2018.Um dos principais desafios enfrentados pelo sistema bancário é garantir a segurança das transações financeiras. Devido à conveniência e aceitação, o uso de caracterı́sticas faciais para autenticação biométrica de usuários em sistemas bancários está se tornando uma tendência mundial. Essa abordagem de autenticação de usuários está atraindo grandes investimentos de instituições bancárias e financeiras, especialmente em cenários de diferentes domı́nios, nos quais imagens faciais tiradas de documentos de identificação são comparadas com autorretratos digitais (selfies) tiradas com câmeras de dispositivos móveis. Neste estudo, coletamos das bases de dados do maior banco público brasileiro um grande dataset, chamado FaceBank, com 27.002 imagens de selfies e fotos de documentos de identificação de 13.501 sujeitos. Em seguida, avaliamos os desempenhos de dois modelos de Redes Neurais Convolucionais bem referenciados (VGG-Face e OpenFace) para extração de caracterı́sticas profundas, bem como os desempenhos de quatro classificadores (SVM Linear, SVM Power Mean, Random Forest e Random Forest com o Ensemble Vote) para autenticação robusta de face em diferentes domı́nios. Com base nos resultados obtidos (precisões superiores a 90%, em geral), é possı́vel concluir que a abordagem de matching de faces profundas avaliada neste estudo é adequada para autenticação de usuários em aplicações bancárias entre domı́nios. Até onde sabemos, este é o primeiro trabalho que usa um grande conjunto de dados composto por imagens bancárias reais para avaliar a abordagem de autenticação de face entre domı́nios. Além disso, este trabalho apresenta um estudo sobre as reais necessidades na implementação futura de um sistema biométrico, propondo um sistema de nuvem para permitir a adoção de tecnologias biométricas. Por fim, propõe também um modelo seguro e integrado de subsistema ABIS de transmissão de dados. Toda a análise e implementação leva em conta a total aderência e compatibilidade com padrões e especificações propostos pelo governo brasileiro.Ensuring the security of transactions is currently one of the major challenges facing banking systems. The use of facial features for biometric authentication of users in banking systems is becoming a worldwide trend, due to the convenience and acceptability of this form of identification, and also because computers and mobile devices already have built-in cameras. This user authentication approach is attracting large investments from banking and financial institutions especially in cross-domain scenarios, in which facial images taken from ID documents are compared with digital self-portraits (selfies) taken with mobile device cameras. In this study, from the databases of the largest public Brazilian bank we collected a large dataset, called FaceBank, with 27,002 images of selfies and ID document photos from 13,501 subjects. Then, we assessed the performances of two well-referenced Convolutional Neural Networks models (VGG-Face and OpenFace) for deep face features extraction, as well as the performances of four effective classifiers (Linear SVM, Power Mean SVM, Random Forest and Random Forest with Ensemble Vote) for robust cross-domain face authentication. Based on the results obtained (authentication accuracies higher than 90%, in general), it is possible to conclude that the deep face matching approach assessed in this study is suitable for user authentication in cross-domain banking applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a large dataset composed of real banking images to assess the cross-domain face authentication approach to be used in banking systems. As an additional, this work presents a study on the real needs in the future implementation of a biometric system proposing a cloud system to enable the adoption of biometrics technologies, creating a new model of service delivery. Besides that, proposes a secure and integrated ABIS Data Transmission subsystem model. All the analysis and implementation takes into account the total adherence and compatibility with the standards and specifications proposed by the Brazilian government, at the same time, establish mechanisms and controls to ensure the effective protection of data",,Matching de faces de diferentes domínios para sistemas de segurança bancário,,,,core
147954965,2009-10-15T15:24:33,"This research project is an experimental study of decision-making in very difficult contexts resembling those encountered in financial markets. The starting point was the empirical observation that financial assets are objects of a very complex kind. Specifically, financial assets generate rewards in an unpredictable way (stochastic processes), and they jump regularly (unstable processes). What's more, they are covert: finance practitioners lack information about their nature, and may well be unable to uncover it. After all, can humans really learn the nature of unstable stochastic processes? To address this question, I designed an investment task, the ""Boardgame,"" characterized by assets – in the form of locations displayed on a board – which are, like the financial assets in the real world, unpredictable, unstable, and (initially) unknown. Specifically, the game consists of choosing between six locations of initially unknown probability of winning or losing. Each trial, the player selects one location and immediately receives the outcome returned by the chosen location (a reward, a loss, or 0 CHF). She accumulates gains and losses throughout the game, with the goal of maximizing the cumulative earnings. One essential characteristic of the Boardgame is that outcome probabilities – at all locations – jump regularly. An ideal player accounts for jump occurrence and re-learns outcome probabilities once a jump has occurred. Such two-stage mental process – consisting of jump detection and subsequent reappraisal of the probabilities – is extremely demanding. I invited 62 subjects – all undergraduate or graduate students at the EPFL – to play the Boardgame during 30 minutes, and recorded their action in each trial (namely, which location they chose). From their choices, I attempted to infer the nature of their learning in the game. To do so, I followed an inter-disciplinary approach, at the intersection of economics, machine learning, and neurobiology. I first formalized normative learning in the game (how ideal players learn), as well as bounded rational learning (how adaptive – intelligent – agents, albeit of limited cognitive capabilities, are expected to learn). I then examined whether my subjects did a good job of learning in the Boardgame, by comparing the fits of the normative and bounded rational models. I eventually studied the neural implementation of the behavior at work. It appears that for the majority of my subjects, the normative learning model did a much better job of explaining actual behavior than the alternative, bounded rational model. In other words, subjects were apt at learning the outcome probabilities of the locations, despite the difficulty of the enterprise. This suggests that people may be better fit to cope with the instability of financial markets than previously thought. Beyond being of interest for the finance field, this result has actually a broader scope. For it demonstrates the human ability to adapt behavior to suit an uncertain changing environment. This cognitive flexibility, which some eminent neuroscientists have been taken to be the most relevant definition of human intelligence, is essential in many domains beyond the one studied here (reward learning) – in particular, the same neuroscientists have suggested that it is chief in contexts of social interaction. The finding that my subjects were very good at learning the nature of the locations is also important from an epistemological point of view. For one message drawn from this study is that people can be very sophisticated in the face of very complex problems. This message should prompt a reevaluation of the scope of the dominant paradigm in decision making – namely, the limited cognition paradigm. The limited cognition paradigm has led either to a hyperemphasis on cognitive biases as sources of human mistakes (irrationality), or to the idea that complexity in a cognitive task precludes the emergence of optimal behavior (bounded rationality). In contrast, the present work highlights human adaptation, and further suggests that complexity is not necessarily an obstacle for full rationality to emerge. One reason that my subjects could fare so well in my complex task is that the human brain is fit to cope with the Boardgame, which is reminiscent of the living conditions of the early man. For Homo has long had to deal with an uncertain unstable environment. As a result, the hominoid brain was geared to cope with instability. The finding that optimal behavior prevailed in my experiment prompted me to flesh out the neural implementation of this behavior. In the final stage of this project, I conjectured a neural system that is fit to cope with unforeseen and ever-changing conditions. I attempted to describe this neural system rigorously, in the vein of a recent computational trend in decision neuroscience. This computational approach aims to reveal the neural substrates of subjective states that the behavioral models purport to estimate – e.g., how much reward a subject expected on each trial, how much surprise a subject experienced on each trial, how much uncertainty a subject perceived in her environment on each trial. Likewise, I estimated subjective variables that are essential to implement the optimal Bayesian rule in my task. In particular, I estimated how much credit a subject assigned to the belief that a jump occurred on each trial. This estimation enabled me to make precise predictions as to the neural mechanisms involved in the Boardgame. The incoming step shall be to put these predictions to a test in an imaging study of the Boardgame. As such, the present research has laid the basis for a larger research program to be pursued. It is hoped that it shows the utility of bringing the modeling tools from economics to bear on neurobiological questions. I think that such scientific exchanges carry the possibility of insights useful to build an adequate model of individual decision-making","Lausanne, EPFL",Essays on individual decision making under uncertainty,,10.5075/epfl-thesis-4532,,core
200996908,,"Predicting the future is no longer about the mystical reading of natural and celestial phenomena. Today it is all about data.

The Real Prediction Machine (RPM) is a domestic product that uses big and small data, in combination with machine learning and predictive modelling to make predictions about specific future events.



Contemporary use of digital networked technology, such as personal computers and smart phones, is effectively feeding a live global human behaviour laboratory with data scientists experimenting on an (often) unknowing pool of billions. The futures that emerge from this research are as yet mostly unknown, but there are hints – as this data accumulates it can be analysed, mined and used in algorithms; patterns or trends invisible to the human observer can be identified; and seemingly random events become predictable. At this time prediction algorithms are predominantly being exploited by big industries such as banking, insurance and commerce, or examined in massive research projects such as the EU funded FuturICT project. They are, however, making surreptitious steps into our lives through tailored internet browsing and predictive shopping with occasional Kafkaesque consequences. 

RPMs exploits the potential of this technology motivated not by the interests of industry and research but by the more emotive and personal needs/desires of people – this has the purpose of communicating the transformative potential of big data in domestic life, and asking if the future possibilities described by the project are desirable.



The concept

When things fail they rarely do so instantaneously but through a gradual process of deterioration. Based on this observation, predictive analytics, through the deployment of sensors in pertinent places and contexts, can determine the when things begin to fail. Such techniques are increasingly used in the mechanical and structural world - to predict for example when a vehicle or bridge might be in need of pre-emptive maintenance.



The RPMs use similar techniques but in the context of human everyday life to predict anything from health related events such as a heart attack to more emotive forecasts such as a domestic argument.



Once the event has been chosen the necessary and available data streams, from local sensors to RSS feeds, determined they are fed into the prediction algorithm - the output of which controls the visual display on the prediction machine. This informs the viewer if the chosen event is approaching, receding or impending. 



The Real Prediction Machines was commissioned by the Crafts Council for the exhibition Crafting Narrative. This explored how contemporary designers and makers use objects as mediums to tell stories.

with high stakes such as finance and healthcare. Despite their superior
performances, many models are black boxes in nature which are hard to explain.
There are growing efforts for researchers to develop methods to interpret these

are widely used approaches to interpret a machine learning model after it has
been built. This class of methods has been shown to exhibit large instability,
posing serious challenges to the effectiveness of the method itself and harming

195380051,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"abstract: Deep learning (DL) has proved itself be one of the most important developements till date with far reaching impacts in numerous fields like robotics, computer vision, surveillance, speech processing, machine translation, finance, etc. They are now widely used for countless applications because of their ability to generalize real world data, robustness to noise in previously unseen data and high inference accuracy. With the ability to learn useful features from raw sensor data, deep learning algorithms have out-performed tradinal AI algorithms and pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved with AI. In this work, we demonstrate the power of deep learning by developing a neural network to automatically detect cough instances from audio recorded in un-constrained environments. For this, 24 hours long recordings from 9 dierent patients is collected and carefully labeled by medical personel. A pre-processing algorithm is proposed to convert event based cough dataset to a more informative dataset with start and end of coughs and also introduce data augmentation for regularizing the training procedure. The proposed neural network achieves 92.3% leave-one-out accuracy on data captured in real world. 

Deep neural networks are composed of multiple layers that are compute/memory intensive. This makes it difficult to execute these algorithms real-time with low power consumption using existing general purpose computers. In this work, we propose hardware accelerators for a traditional AI algorithm based on random forest trees and two representative deep convolutional neural networks (AlexNet and VGG). With the proposed acceleration techniques, ~ 30x performance improvement was achieved compared to CPU for random forest trees. For deep CNNS, we demonstrate that much higher performance can be achieved with architecture space exploration using any optimization algorithms with system level performance and area models for hardware primitives as inputs and goal of minimizing latency with given resource constraints. With this method, ~30GOPs performance was achieved for Stratix V FPGA boards. 

Hardware acceleration of DL algorithms alone is not always the most ecient way and sucient to achieve desired performance. There is a huge headroom available for performance improvement provided the algorithms are designed keeping in mind the hardware limitations and bottlenecks. This work achieves hardware-software co-optimization for Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm. Using the proposed algorithmic changes and hardware architecture 

With CMOS scaling coming to an end and increasing memory bandwidth bottlenecks, CMOS based system might not scale enough to accommodate requirements of more complicated and deeper neural networks in future. In this work, we explore RRAM crossbars and arrays as compact, high performing and energy efficient alternative to CMOS accelerators for deep learning training and inference. We propose and implement RRAM periphery read and write circuits and achieved ~3000x performance improvement in online dictionary learning compared to CPU. 

This work also examines the realistic RRAM devices and their non-idealities. We do an in-depth study of the effects of RRAM non-idealities on inference accuracy when a pretrained model is mapped to RRAM based accelerators. To mitigate this issue, we propose Random Sparse Adaptation (RSA), a novel scheme aimed at tuning the model to take care of the faults of the RRAM array on which it is mapped. Our proposed method can achieve inference accuracy much higher than what traditional Read-Verify-Write (R-V-W) method could achieve. RSA can also recover lost inference accuracy 100x ~ 1000x faster compared to R-V-W. Using 32-bit high precision RSA cells, we achieved  ~10% higher accuracy using fautly RRAM arrays compared to what can be achieved by mapping a deep network to an 32 level RRAM array with no variations.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Electrical Engineering 201",,Algorithm and Hardware Design for Efficient Deep Learning Inference,https://core.ac.uk/download/195380051.pdf,,,core

Computational finance is a compelling application area for reinforcement learning research, where hard sequential decision making problems abound and have great practical significance.

We also investigate TVR, another policy iteration method. We compare LSPI, TVR with LSM, the standard least squares Monte Carlo method from the finance community. We evaluate their performance on both real and synthetic data. The results show that the exercise policies discovered by LSPI and TVR gain larger payoffs than those discovered by LSM, on both real and synthetic data. Furthermore, for LSPI, TVR and LSM, policies learned from real data generally gain larger payoffs than policies learned from simulated samples. Our work shows that solution methods developed in reinforcement learning can advance the state of the art in an important and challenging application area, and demonstrates furthermore that computational finance remains an under-explored area for deployment of reinforcement learning methods.

79587102,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"abstract: The dawn of Internet of Things (IoT) has opened the opportunity for mainstream adoption of machine learning analytics. However, most research in machine learning has focused on discovery of new algorithms or fine-tuning the performance of existing algorithms. Little exists on the process of taking an algorithm from the lab-environment into the real-world, culminating in sustained value. Real-world applications are typically characterized by dynamic non-stationary systems with requirements around feasibility, stability and maintainability. Not much has been done to establish standards around the unique analytics demands of real-world scenarios.

This research explores the problem of the why so few of the published algorithms enter production and furthermore, fewer end up generating sustained value. The dissertation proposes a ‘Design for Deployment’ (DFD) framework to successfully build machine learning analytics so they can be deployed to generate sustained value. The framework emphasizes and elaborates the often neglected but immensely important latter steps of an analytics process: ‘Evaluation’ and ‘Deployment’. A representative evaluation framework is proposed that incorporates the temporal-shifts and dynamism of real-world scenarios. Additionally, the recommended infrastructure allows analytics projects to pivot rapidly when a particular venture does not materialize. Deployment needs and apprehensions of the industry are identified and gaps addressed through a 4-step process for sustainable deployment. Lastly, the need for analytics as a functional area (like finance and IT) is identified to maximize the return on machine-learning deployment.

The framework and process is demonstrated in semiconductor manufacturing – it is highly complex process involving hundreds of optical, electrical, chemical, mechanical, thermal, electrochemical and software processes which makes it a highly dynamic non-stationary system. Due to the 24/7 uptime requirements in manufacturing, high-reliability and fail-safe are a must. Moreover, the ever growing volumes mean that the system must be highly scalable. Lastly, due to the high cost of change, sustained value proposition is a must for any proposed changes. Hence the context is ideal to explore the issues involved. The enterprise use-cases are used to demonstrate the robustness of the framework in addressing challenges encountered in the end-to-end process of productizing machine learning analytics in dynamic read-world scenarios.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Computer Science 201",,Crossing the Chasm: Deploying Machine Learning Analytics in Dynamic Real-World Scenarios,https://core.ac.uk/download/79587102.pdf,,,core

To reduce potential risk and build trust with users, it is critical to interpret how such machines make their decisions. Existing works interpret a pre-trained neural network by analyzing hidden neurons, mimicking pre-trained models or approximating local predictions. However, these methods do not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency of their interpretations. In this paper, we propose an elegant closed form solution named $OpenBox$ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family of Piecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN). The major idea is to first transform a PLNN into a mathematically equivalent set of linear classifiers, then interpret each linear classifier by the features that dominate its prediction. We further apply $OpenBox$ to demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negative and sparse constraints on improving the interpretability of PLNNs.

Contudo, várias iniciativas empíricas têm demonstrado que a afirmação da TME não é totalmente correta. Entre as frentes de pesquisa que buscam prever os movimentos de ativos financeiros, pode-se destacar a área com um ponto de vista econométrico, que tenta prever movimentos mediante métodos matemáticos e estatísticos, como regressão linear e regressão não linear, bem como as redes neurais. Além disso, em outra área de pesquisa, há a Teoria Multiagente de Modelagem de Mercado (Theory of Multi-Agent Market Modeling) que foca sua atenção na microestrutura do mercado, partindo do princípio de que os movimentos de preços emergem da interação de muitos agentes individuais do mercado. Contudo, esses modelos financeiros baseados em agentes têm algumas limitações. Não é possível adequar os agentes a dados reais do mercado para gerar previsões futuras, pois na maioria dos modelos a tomada de decisão é feita por meio de funções ad-hoc ou mecanismos que não podem ser ajustados a dados externos. Para obter uma previsão real do modelo, é preciso adaptar o mecanismo de decisão dos agentes com modelos econométricos, como as redes neurais, que podem ser ajustadas a séries de dados reais. Dessa forma, por intermédio da interação dos agentes, o modelo de mercado resultante pode capturar a dinâmica oculta do mercado e prever os movimentos futuros com uma eficácia maior do que faria um sistema de regressão não linear isoladamente. Este trabalho propõe um modelo computacional baseado na utilização do comportamento emergente de uma comunidade de agentes de software com mecanismos de decisão cognitiva, baseados em redes neurais, com o objetivo de realizar previsões do comportamento do Índice da Bolsa de Valores de São Paulo # Índice Bovespa. Os agentes da comunidade interagem com um mecanismo de coleta dos valores das 65 ações mais negociadas da Bovespa que compõem o Índice Bovespa, utilizados para computar as previsões de evolução do índice. A fim de validar a hipótese da pesquisa, é feita uma comparação entre os resultados obtidos pelo modelo implementado, com uma abordagem tradicional de previsão baseada exclusivamente em redes neurais. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que as previsões do modelo proposto são mais performáticas do que a previsão isolada do índice baseada exclusivamente em redes neurais, já que o modelo proposto captura melhor a microestrutura do mercado, prevendo um passo a frente de maneira mais eficaz.In finance world , the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) states that the financial assets have random price fluctuation, so, there are not ways to protect the investor forecasting the future market movements. However, several initiatives have shown that empirical assertion of EMH is not entirely correct. Among the research fronts that seek to predict the movements of financial assets, we can highlight the area with an econometric point of view, which attempts to predict movements through mathematical and statistical methods such as linear regression and nonlinear regression, as well as neural networks. Moreover, in another area of research, we have the Theory of Multi-Agent Market Modeling that focuses attention on the micro-structure of the market, assuming that the price movements emerge from the interaction of many actors in the market. However, these financial models based on agents have some limitations. It is not possible to match agents to actual market data to forecast a step ahead, as in most models of decision making is done through ad-hoc functions or mechanisms that can not be adjusted to external data. For a preview of the real model, you need to adapt the decision-making mechanism of the agents with econometric models such as neural networks, which can be adjusted to actual data sets. Thus, through the interaction of the agents, the market model results can capture the hidden dynamics of the market and predict future movements with greater effectiveness than would a system of non-linear regression alone. This paper proposes a computational model based on the use of emergent behavior of a community of software agents with cognitive decision-making mechanisms base on neural networks in order to make predictions of the behavior of the index of He Stock Exchange of São Paulo # Bovespa Index. The agents of the community interact with one engine collects the values of the 65 most actively traded stocks that comprise the Bovespa Bovespa Index, used to compute the projected trend of the index. In order to validate the hypothesis of the study, a comparison is made between the results obtained by the model implemented with a traditional approach to forecasting based solely on neural networks. The results show that by the proposed model are more performing than the forecast index alone based solely on neural networks, since the proposed model better captures the microstructure of the market, and one step ahead more effectively",,Desenvolvimento de um modelo de sistema multiagente para previsão de retorno sobre indices de ações,https://core.ac.uk/download/30375150.pdf,,,core

A multiple criteria decision-making model is developed in order to determine the most appropriate intergenerational learning activities and the factors that strongly influence human resource managers' decisions. Data are collected from 35 human resource managers who have extensive work experience in the hotel industry and in managing intergenerational learning activities, and processed using the analytic network process. The results prove that the most appropriate IGL activities for the Romanian hotel industry are mentoring, on-the-job education, and storytelling. Furthermore, the most influential factors are collaboration, commitment, job satisfaction, reward management, and organizational culture. These results have both theoretical and practical implications. On the one hand, they extend the literature regarding intergenerational learning in the hotel industry and on the other hand, they bring forward how the managers could foster intergenerational knowledge sharing and avoid corporate amnesia.Leon, R.

464903810,2021-11-10T00:00:00,"Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from
multiple heterogeneous sources of data. It is a challenging yet crucial area
with numerous real-world applications in multimedia, affective computing,
robotics, finance, human-computer interaction, and healthcare. Unfortunately,
multimodal research has seen limited resources to study (1) generalization
across domains and modalities, (2) complexity during training and inference,
and (3) robustness to noisy and missing modalities. In order to accelerate
progress towards understudied modalities and tasks while ensuring real-world
robustness, we release MultiBench, a systematic and unified large-scale
benchmark spanning 15 datasets, 10 modalities, 20 prediction tasks, and 6
research areas. MultiBench provides an automated end-to-end machine learning
pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading, experimental setup, and
model evaluation. To enable holistic evaluation, MultiBench offers a
comprehensive methodology to assess (1) generalization, (2) time and space
complexity, and (3) modality robustness. MultiBench introduces impactful
challenges for future research, including scalability to large-scale multimodal
datasets and robustness to realistic imperfections. To accompany this
benchmark, we also provide a standardized implementation of 20 core approaches
in multimodal learning. Simply applying methods proposed in different research
areas can improve the state-of-the-art performance on 9/15 datasets. Therefore,
MultiBench presents a milestone in unifying disjoint efforts in multimodal
research and paves the way towards a better understanding of the capabilities
and limitations of multimodal models, all the while ensuring ease of use,
accessibility, and reproducibility. MultiBench, our standardized code, and
leaderboards are publicly available, will be regularly updated, and welcomes
inputs from the community.Comment: NeurIPS 2021 Datasets and Benchmarks Track. Code:

151251663,2019-09-12T00:00:00,"Strong intelligent machines powered by deep neural networks are increasingly
deployed as black boxes to make decisions in risk-sensitive domains, such as
finance and medical. To reduce potential risk and build trust with users, it is
critical to interpret how such machines make their decisions. Existing works
interpret a pre-trained neural network by analyzing hidden neurons, mimicking
pre-trained models or approximating local predictions. However, these methods
do not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency of their
interpretation. In this paper, we propose an elegant closed form solution named
$OpenBox$ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family of
Piecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN). The major idea is to first transform a
PLNN into a mathematically equivalent set of linear classifiers, then interpret
each linear classifier by the features that dominate its prediction. We further
apply $OpenBox$ to demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negative and sparse
constraints on improving the interpretability of PLNNs. The extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets clearly demonstrate the
exactness and consistency of our interpretation.Comment: KDD 201",,"Exact and Consistent Interpretation for Piecewise Linear Neural

326448414,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Neuro-fuzzy systems are hybrid systems that take advantage on the functionalities of fuzzy logics and neural networks. The IF-THEN fuzzy rules allow good interpretability for human experts to understand the correlation between inputs and outputs. However, only the neuro-fuzzy’s designer knows the mechanism and behavior of the system. To an enterprise point of view, e.g. finance world, the details on what makes the system arrive and formulate its predictions or rules is unknown. This is due to the lack of transparency between the system and the human experts. 
This paper proposes two novel types of explainable artificial intelligent (XAI) feature implemented using the neuro fuzzy architecture called Self Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Network with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation or Extrapolation (SaFIN(FRIE)). The two explainable AI feature are in a form of a graphical user interface (GUI) to assist the human expert to understand the inner mechanics of function on how it draws conclusion with the data fed into the system. 
One of the challenges for the fuzzy neural system is the making of a real-time prediction in the financial market where data can be sparse. As such, it is not able to automatically detect and react to the occurrence of concept drift and shifts, affecting their online learning capabilities. SaFIN(FRIE) employs interpolation and extrapolation techniques to make inference when drift or shift is detected. A general episodic memory technique is employed to capture and retrieve from past events that SaFIN(FRIE) learns. This is done by storing and retrieving them from an episodic memory storage during transient event behavior.Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science",'Nanyang Technological University',GEMM-SaFIN(FRIE)++ : explainable artificial intelligent with episodic memory,,,,core
251203367,2018-10-11T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Logistic regression is a popular technique used in machine learning to construct classification models. Since the construction of such models is based on computing with large datasets, it is an appealing idea to outsource this computation to a cloud service. The privacy-sensitive nature of the input data requires appropriate privacy preserving measures before outsourcing it. Homomorphic encryption enables one to compute on encrypted data directly, without decryption and can be used to mitigate the privacy concerns raised by using a cloud service. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an algorithm (and its implementation) to train a logistic regression model on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. The core of our algorithm consists of a new iterative method that can be seen as a simplified form of the fixed Hessian method, but with a much lower multiplicative complexity. RESULTS: We test the new method on two interesting real life applications: the first application is in medicine and constructs a model to predict the probability for a patient to have cancer, given genomic data as input; the second application is in finance and the model predicts the probability of a credit card transaction to be fraudulent. The method produces accurate results for both applications, comparable to running standard algorithms on plaintext data. CONCLUSIONS: This article introduces a new simple iterative algorithm to train a logistic regression model that is tailored to be applied on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. This algorithm can be used as a privacy-preserving technique to build a binary classification model and can be applied in a wide range of problems that can be modelled with logistic regression. Our implementation results show that our method can handle the large datasets used in logistic regression training.status: publishe",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Privacy-preserving logistic regression training,,10.1186/s12920-018-0398-y,"[{'title': 'BMC Medical Genomics', 'identifiers': ['1755-8794', 'issn:1755-8794']}]",core

Discussions about the rapid changes in society caused by  drsatic technological changes are vigorous. Currently, vocational education and training in Korea focuses on the development and application of national competence standards and the expansion of work-based learning. This study began with the question ""Is the direction of these high school vocational education policies compatible with the coming changes?"" The purpose of this study is to consider how vocational high school education should respond to technological change. 

2. Research Method

In order to find out the future direction of vocational high school education, we reviewed the existing discussions about technology change, job change, change in demand on competences and education change in the artificial intelligence era. 
In this study, 43 teachers engaged participated in a future workshop. The workshop was conducted three times. During the workshop, we recorded the discussions and conducted text mining and qualitative analysis.
Two surveys were conducted for teachers who participated in the workshop. We analyzed the teachers' perceptions about the direction and purpose of the ideal vocational high school education and analyzed the changes before and after the workshop. One month after the end of the workshop, teachers were asked to evaluate the future orientation of the current policy.

3. Technological Change, Job Change and Necessary Competences in the Era of Artificial Intelligence

We reviewed the development process of artificial intelligence technology and social changes due to technological change such as increasing dependence of task on machinery, platform-based industrial development, changes in production and consumption patterns, political change, and cultural change.
Several studies(WEF, 2016; Grace et al., 2017; Oh, Young et al., 2016; Kim, Seum-woo) differ in methodology and it is not appropriate to concretely synthesize the results of the research. There may be disagreements as to the magnitude and speed of the disappearance of jobs, but the vocational world will be largely reorganized in sooner or later. Jobs expected to have a relatively high possibility of replacement by machines were predicted as transportation, office and administrative support, service, sales, manufacturing, and construction. On the other hand, education, law, arts, social services, management and business, finance, health and computer related jobs are less likely to be automated.
Future Jobs changes involve not only the increase or decrease of jobs, but also the change in employment patterns. Flexible employment is expected to expand and short-term employment will increase. With the development of platform-based services, non-typical employment such as platform workers is expected to continue to expand.
As the future competences, problem solving ability, interpersonal ability (social intelligence), high level cognitive ability (agile thinking ability), creativity (design thinking) and communication ability were emphasized. These competencies are already emphasized as core competencies. Media competencies, virtual cooperation competencies, and digital competencies (data thinking) are added in recognition of technological change. We also considered Gardner's emphasis on the five minds for the future.
Given that there is more potential for future developments in jobs that require processes and strategies that can not be prescribed in advance, current vocational high school education policies that emphasize concrete and explicit skills can be seen as contrary to this trend.
We reviewed future prospects for education and examples of applying the latest technologies to education, and highlighted the following issues. First, the value of knowledge is still important in school education. Second, if artificial intelligence technology is actively used, it is more likely to realize the ideal of individualized customized learning. Third, we paid attention to the possibility that the application of advanced technology could be operated in a way that equality in education, respect for diversity, and social integration through it. Fourth, we need to pay attention to the advantages and limitations of hybrid education through MOOC. Finally, The teacher needs to develop a wide range of competencies, and changes in the curriculum of teacher training are needed.


4. Teachers' Perception on Future Society and Future Vocational high school Education

In order for teachers to visualize the future of vocational high school education, vision of future society should be premised. A total of 43 teachers participated in the future workshop, composed of 4 scenarios where teachers could experience one of them. 
The resuts of text mining on the teachers' narratives in the future workshop were presented for each scenarios. In all scenarios, ‘human’ is a major concept.  In blue society, there is a concept of ‘community’ and ‘environment friendly’, whereas in orange society, there is the concept of ‘individual’ and ‘polarization’. It is blue society and orange society that ‘life’ is closely related to ‘human’, an ‘work’ is especially emphasized only in orange society. In orange society, ‘work’ is closely connected with ‘human’and ‘robot’.
Teachers mentioned as contents of the future vocational high school education most frequently about liberal arts and personality education, reflection on human and life, emotional education, value and ethics education, and basic vocational compatences. There are teachers who have emphasized technical education, but it has also been predicted that the importance of technical education for specific functions will be lowered. Teachers envisioned that in future vocational education, individualized education reflecting the needs and characteristics of students will be carried out and high technology such as virtual reality, big data and robot technology will be applied to vocational high school education.
Teachers predict that future teachers will act as guiders, assistants, coaches, facilitators, coordinators, life designers, career guiders, and counselors. Teachers are predicting that the status of teachers will be lowered and their roles will be reduced in the future. 
There was a change in the awareness of the purpose of vocational high school education for teachers after the workshop. First, the tendency to respond to the needs of specific companies through specific skills acquisition and to emphasize employment after graduation has decreased. Instead, there has been a stronger agreement on broader skills, transferable capabilities, holistic development of students and access to broader career choices.
A month after the workshop, a questionnaire was sent to teachers to evaluate current vocational high school education policy. Teachers recognized that apprenticeship program, NCS based curriculum, and work-based training were not future oriented. 

5. Direction of 2030 Vocational High School Education

□ Moving focus from human resources to future competitiveness of students 
Instead of focusing too much on the need of the labor market, it is necessary to focus more on strengthening students' competencies in vocational high school education, so that they can adapt successfully to an uncertain future and live in a meaningful connection with society.

□ Turning in a direction to provide a wider experience than a specific skills
The NCS approach to break down job units into observable sub-elements emphasizes working in a predictable manner. Jobs to which this approach is applied is a job in which automation in the future can occur most efficiently. Competitive advantage in the current labor market, not only in the future, is to creatively and autonomously improve work and create new value. To help students become competitive in a changing future society, it is necessary to mitigate the current rigid curriculum and regime represented by NCS in  vocational high school education.

□ Transition from job preparation institutions to complex functional education institutions
It should be possible to set up the purpose and function of  vocational education more comprehensive and to provide flexible programs for various purposes. 

□ From basic vocational competences to conceptual thinking and higher mental functions
Emphasis on basic vocational competences in vocational high school education could imply a risk of accepting a standardized and fragmented approach, comforting that it is developing a very useful ability. Despite the fact that basic vocational competences are developed through various curricular activities, but they themselves can not be replaced with the purpose of the academic subjects. It is essential to learn conceptual and theoretical knowledge in school education so that they can understand the principles and apply them to newly developed situations.

□ Prioritization of cutting-edge teaching techniques 
Vocational high school policy has been changed in its direction whenever the regime changes. Policy was decided and implemented unilaterally without proper discussion. Now, it is necessary to look at vocational education as an object to be invested. It is necessary to push forward the high-technology of high school vocational education so that the most advanced technologies can be applied to the vocational high school education scene.

□ Meister and Makerspace
It is necessary to build makerspaces that provide the spaces where creativity and voluntary function can be demonstrated and to guide the path as a Meister.

□ From equality of access to equality of consequence and social integration
In high school vocational education, it is necessary to clearly set the minimum standards for individuals to live happily and healthily in future society, and to convert them into the direction of encouraging educational resources to reach all students. This emphasizes the equality of educational outcomes, not merely the equality of educational opportunities. Decisions should be made to prioritize resources so that students may be able to graduate from high school while meeting minimum standards by strengthening differentiated programs.

□ Change in teacher placement and teacher training
Teacher’s role should change drastically in order to lead future change and adapt to social change. Teachers should be proficient in technology-based teaching and learning methods for constructing class contents and supporting and evaluating learners using various technologies.

□ Build a platform for social consensus in vocational high school education
In the process of change of high school vocational education policy, a few experts or policy makers tried to make a large system change without sufficient consideration. I would like to propose a system for leading and implementing and seeking change and development of high school vocational education for the future. This proposal should be a critical review of the current situation and an active response to the future, and should be a process involving all stakeholders in vocational high school education.요약       ix

21416493,2010,"Energy-efficient computing is important in several systems ranging from embedded devices to large scale data centers. Several application domains offer the opportunity to tradeoff quality of service/solution (QoS) for improvements in performance and reduction in energy consumption. Programmers sometimes take advantage of such opportunities, albeit in an ad-hoc manner and often without providing any QoS guarantees. We propose a system called Green that provides a simple and flexible framework that allows programmers to take advantage of such approximation opportunities in a systematic manner while providing statistical QoS guarantees. Green enables programmers to approximate expensive functions and loops and operates in two phases. In the calibration phase, it builds a model of the QoS loss produced by the approximation. This model is used in the operational phase to make approximation decisions based on the QoS constraints specified by the programmer. The operational phase also includes an adaptation function that occasionally monitors the runtime behavior and changes the approximation decisions and QoS model to provide strong statistical QoS guarantees. To evaluate the effectiveness of Green, we implemented our system and language extensions using the Phoenix compiler framework. Our experiments using benchmarks from domains such as graphics, machine learning, signal processing, and finance, and an in-production, real-world web search engine, indicate that Green can produce significant improvements in performance and energy consumption with small and controlled QoS degradation",,Green: a framework for supporting energy-conscious programming using controlled approximation,,,,core

the alternating direction method of multipliers, employing a novel operator
splitting technique that requires the solution of a quasi-definite linear

algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as
positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the
constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial
matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time
applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first
operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal
and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also
supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly
efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and
machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint,
is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from
a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than
competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization

This evolution drives systematic running processes, involves less overhead of managerial activities and increased production rate. However, it also gave birth to different kinds of attacks and security issues at the data storage level and process level. The real-life implementation of such AI-enabled intelligent systems is currently plagued by the lack of security and trust levels in system predictions. Blockchain is a prevailing technology that can help to alleviate the security risks of AI applications. These two technologies are complementing each other as Blockchain can mitigate vulnerabilities in AI, and AI can improve the performance of Blockchain. Many studies are currently being conducted on the applicability of Blockchains for securing intelligent applications in various crucial domains such as healthcare, finance, energy, government, and defense.

For demonstration purpose, the framework is implemented on a set of real-life online banking transaction datasets obtained from a UK-based bank through three models, i.e., Support Vector Machine, Markov Model and LSTM model, with various combinational features of the datasets evidenced in the exploratory analysis and modelling with noise ratios of datasets, range values of model parameters and confidence intervals of prediction results. The modelling results show that overall, the LSTM model achieves the best performance, with outcome accuracy of 97.7%, indicating its advantage in modelling sequential data such as customer behaviours over other models. The SVM-4 model among all the SVM models and the Markov model with sampling rate of 5s among the Markov models give the best results in their own category. The research highlights an adoption of multiple machine learning approach with model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to compare the results, raise the statistical confidence and enhance the model accuracy and robustness. The future research will explore the distributed training by deploying the framework in a High-Performance Computing environment. The theorization of the comparative and comprehensive approach for general-purpose fraud detection will also be accomplished",'IGI Global',An integrated Machine Learning framework for fraud detection: a comparative and comprehensive approach,,,,core

The selection algorithm Median of Medians, although a landmark theoretical achievement, is seldom used in practice because it is slower than simple approaches based on sampling. The main contribution of this paper is a fast linear-time deterministic selection algorithm MedianOfNinthers based on a refined definition of MedianOfMedians. A complementary algorithm MedianOfExtrema is also proposed. These algorithms work together to solve the selection problem in guaranteed linear time, faster than state-of-the-art baselines, and without resorting to randomization, heuristics, or fallback approaches for pathological cases.

This is shown not only by setting up a theoretical framework, but also by a real world application: the calculation of banking fees. We tackle the problems of deciding whether such a rule set is total and deterministic, i.e. does it permit calculation of a fee for every business deal, and can only one fee be computed in each case. Although these questions are undecidable in general, the restricted form of the investigated rule sets makes them decidable and even tractable in practise. Experiences with our system implemented in Prolog as well as some questions one may have with the application are discussed.

24320124,1995,"The genuine symbolic machine learning (ML) algorithms are capable of processing symbolic, categorial data only. However, real-world problems, e.g. in medicine or finance, involve both symbolic and numerical attributes. Therefore, there is an important issue of ML to discretize (categorize) numerical attributes. There exist quite a few discretization procedures in the ML field. This paper describes two newer algorithms for categorization (discretization) of numerical attributes. The first one is implemented in the KEX (Knowledge EXplorer) as its preprocessing procedure. Its idea is to discretize the numerical attributes in such a way that the resulting categorization fits the way how KEX creates a knowledge base. Nevertheless, the resulting categorization is suitable also for other machine learning algorithms. The other discretization procedure is implemented in CN4, a large extension of the well-known CN2 machine learning algorithm.

This has created the need for powerful frameworks which can predict and reduce the potential risks in financial applications. Such frameworks help organizations to enhance their services quality and productivity as well as reducing the financial risk. The widely used techniques to build predictive models in the financial sector are based on statistical regression, which is deployed in many financial applications such as risk forecasting, customers’ loan default and fraud detection. However, in the last few years, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has increased in many financial institutions because they can provide powerful predictive models. However, the vast majority of the existing AI techniques employ black box models like Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and Neural Network (NNs) which are not able to give clear and transparent reasoning to explain the extracted decision. However, nowadays transparent reasoning models are highly needed for financial applications. This paper presents a type-2 fuzzy logic system for predicting default in financial systems. the researchers used a real dataset collected from the banking sector in Sudan. The proposed system resulted in transparent outputs which could be easily understood, analyzed and augmented by the human stakeholders.

It is division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas.

Thus, it is important to take note of the time where investments in new technologies directed at the safety of the railway enable safety and protection in this area. Novel technological techniques such as big data analysis (BDA), data mining or machine learning (ML) have been developed and applied in many areas such as sales, banking and healthcare. The development of such methods has important benefits within the context of railway safety, however, these new methods need to be implemented and developed with consideration of whether these operational models can help to solve the various difficulties that currently exist in the risk analysis of railway stations. Moreover, as the adoption of the Internet of thing (IoT) grows, it is expected that analytical needs for handling data will also increase. It has been shown that the progression towards automation and applying such innovative new technologies such as BDA may be a powerful tool for integration in the future of transportation in general and the railway industry in particular, whereby analytical predictions can aid in the development of safer railway stations which have greater potential for ensuring the safety of passengers. In this paper a Bow Tie (BT) framework model has been created to combine BDA into the risk assessment process. The BDA can be beneficial to the risk assessment, support the decision makers in real time, and reduce human errors.

The study of artificial intelligence (AI) is being exhibited as a core strategy to meet growing demands of science and applications, to solve complex problems in various areas such as environmental science, finance, health-sector, etc. Machine learning (ML) is as a subfield of AI, mainly concerned with the development of techniques and algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. In an innovative way, this work intends to survey and demonstrate the effectiveness of bringing together traditional archaeological questions, such as the analysis of settlement patterns and past human behavior, with cutting edge technologies related to Machine Learning. Computations were carried out using R free software environment for statistical computing and graphics; data pre- and post-processing was performed in a GIS (Geographical Information System) environment. We provide a data-driven basis example of archaeological predictive modeling (APM) for the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Namely, a dataset of known archaeological sites of the Roman period was considered. The APM represents an automated decision making and probabilistic reasoning tool, relevant for archaeological risk assessment and cultural heritage management. We adopted Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001), an ensemble ML algorithm based on decision trees. The model is capable of learning from data and make predictions starting from the acquired knowledge through the modelling of the hidden relationships between a set of input (i.e. geo-environmental features prone to influence site locations) and output variables (i.e. the archeological sites).As result, we obtained: 1) a ranking of geo-environmental features influencing the archeological site occurrence; 2) a map of probability expressing the likelihood of archaeological site presence, at different locations in a given landscape. These outputs become important not only to verify the reliability of the data, but also to stimulate experts in different ways: they are elicited to characterize the benefits and constraints of using such techniques and ultimately to think big about archaeological data",,"An innovative approach for risk assessment in archaeology based on machine learning.

344793943,2010-06-02T00:00:00,"Energy-efficient computing is important in several systems ranging from embedded devices to large scale data centers. Several application domains offer the opportunity to tradeoff quality of service/solution (QoS) for improvements in performance and reduction in energy consumption. Programmers sometimes take advantage of such opportunities, albeit in an ad-hoc manner and often without providing any QoS guarantees. We propose a system called Green that provides a simple and flexible framework that allows programmers to take advantage of such approximation opportunities in a systematic manner while providing statistical QoS guarantees. Green enables programmers to approximate expensive functions and loops and operates in two phases. In the calibration phase, it builds a model of the QoS loss produced by the approximation. This model is used in the operational phase to make approximation decisions based on the QoS constraints specified by the programmer. The operational phase also includes an adaptation function that occasionally monitors the runtime behavior and changes the approximation decisions and QoS model to provide strong statistical QoS guarantees. To evaluate the effectiveness of Green, we implemented our system and language extensions using the Phoenix compiler framework. Our experiments using benchmarks from domains such as graphics, machine learning, signal processing, and finance, and an in-production, real-world web search engine, indicate that Green can produce significant improvements in performance and energy consumption with small and controlled QoS degradation.

32441784,2015-11-09T17:54:54,"Machines today lack the inherent ability to reason and make decisions, or operate in the presence of uncertainty. Machine-learning methods such as Bayesian Networks (BNs) are widely acknowledged for their ability to uncover relationships and generate causal models for complex interactions. However, their massive computational requirement, when implemented on conventional computers, hinders their usefulness in many critical problem areas e.g., genetic basis of diseases, macro finance, text classification, environment monitoring, etc. We propose a new non-von Neumann technology framework purposefully architected across all layers for solving these problems efficiently through physical equivalence, enabled by emerging nanotechnology. The architecture builds on a probabilistic information representation and multi-domain mixed-signal circuit style, and is tightly coupled to a nanoscale physical layer that spans magnetic and electrical domains. Based on bottom-up device-circuit-architecture simulations, we show up to four orders of magnitude performance improvement (using computational resolution of 0.1) vs. best-of-breed multi-core machines with 100 processors, for BNs with about a million variables. Smaller problem sizes of ~100 variables can be realized at 20 mW power consumption and very low area around a few tenths of a mm2.

427481819,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"In chapter 1, an introduction to KBC Securities and KBC Markets is provided. It is mentioned that KBC Securities plays a significant role in the Benelux capital markets and has been rewarded with the title of Equity Finance House of the Year and Cash Market Brokerage House of the Year in 2017. Nevertheless, KBC Securities and KBC Markets operate in a changing environment and are facing a series of challenges: new regulation, advances in innovative technology, strong competitors, new entrants and higher demanding clients. As a result, the following research question was formulated: ""How can KBC Securities and KBC Markets stay relevant in the future?"". Additionally, we researched several subquestions such as: ""What are the reasons clients (do not) choose for KBC Securities? What activities do clients expect and want, now and in the future? Are KBC Securities clients satisfied with the service level they receive? How does KBC Securities' client experience compare to competitors?"". In chapter 2, an overview of the selected methodologies is given in order to tackle the research question. This study is exploratory and has an inductive approach using qualitative research in order to fulfil the purpose of the paper. Semi-structured interviews with clients, non-clients, industry experts, academics and employees were chosen as a way to gather empirical data for research. An overview of the interview questions can be found in this chapter. Additionally, we supplemented our findings using secondary research: journals, books, articles and working papers conducted by academics and global professional management firms. In chapter 3, several conceptual strategy frameworks are presented which are used to tackle the research question in a structured way. First, a strategic framework of Bain & Company is given which involves making deliberate choices in three areas: ambition, where-to-play and how-to-win. The main focus of this paper will be on the ""how-to-win"" question. Second, the three value disciplines of Treacy & Wiersema are used to answer the ""how-to-win"" question and it is concluded that ""customer intimacy"" is the appropriate strategy for KBC Securities. This strategy focuses on offering unique customer services that allow tailored solutions to meet different customer demand. Companies who pursue this strategy bundle services and products into a solution designed specifically for the customer's problem. As a result of this strategy, KBC Securities will face a new key challenge: switch from being product-centric (the so called 'product-factory) to being client-centric. Thirdly, a framework of prof. dr. Kurt Verweire is used to implement customer intimacy based on seven building blocks: (1) strategic positioning, (2) customer relationship management (CRM), (3) client segmentation, (4) client profitability, (5) key account management, (6) tracking client satisfaction and (7) a dynamic and proactive approach. In chapter 4, the paper elaborates on the seven building blocks that are needed to achieve customer intimacy: (1) Strategic positioning: KBC Securities should position itself as a local specialist. A local specialist is an investment bank with deep capabilities in individual markets or regions, and strong local knowledge, networks and connectivity. (2) Customer relationship management: In context of achieving customer intimacy, CRM systems are indispensable. Two elements are essential to successfully implement CRM, namely CRM data collection and CRM data usage. The benefits of a good CRM system are listed and several recommendations for KBC Securities are given. (3) Client segmentation: We suggest implementing a value-driven segmentation system based on the client's current value, potential value and behaviour. This results in three client segments: priority, specialised and self service. For each segment, a distinct differentiation approach and clear rules for coverage structure, content access and execution and platform capabilities should be developed. (4) Client profitability: Client relationships should be managed in terms of profitability, not revenues. KBC Securities should consider both client revenues as well the cost-to-serve these clients. (5) Key Account Management (KAM): KAM is an approach to act as a real business partner for clients. This enables to build loyalty, customer commitment and give the client a single point of contact. We believe an appropriate person to fulfil the key account manager's position is the senior corporate banker. Another option would be to develop the function of a key account manager in-house at KBC Securities. This person could then join client meetings with the corporate banker and proactively approach clients of KBC Securities to identify business opportunities. (6) Tracking client satisfaction: We believe it is essential for KBC Securities to track client satisfaction more rigorously. This happens in three simple stages: gather input data, analyse the input data and adjust the services based on the outcome of this analysis. Internally, senior management's involvement and the documenting of outputs are important. (7) Dynamic and proactive approach: Based on client interviews, it seems that KBC Securities sometimes lacks dynamism and proactivity in its business approach when compared to competitors. We elaborate on this concept and emphasise the importance of staying sharp in every business interaction. In chapter 5, we elaborate on some additional findings which are relevant for KBC Securities, but not directly related to implementing customer intimacy. More specifically, it covers the following topics: innovation & technology and some suggestions for starting activities. Concerning innovation and technology, we identify some critical areas where IT investments should be focused on: dealing with legacy IT and customer-centric solutions. We also elaborate on the implementation of a 'Technology Plan' which is based on three elements: a budget, a time-period and an 'IT Innovation Officer'. The IT Innovation Officer should be responsible for developing a cohesive innovation and technology strategy for KBC Securities. Related to the suggestions for starting activities, we elaborate on (1) starting in-house private equity activities, (2) cross-selling in KBC Securities, (3) the organisational set-up of the corporate finance team and (4) convertible bonds. (1) Starting of in-house private equity activities: Having in-house private equity activities might be beneficial for KBC Securities, as well as for KBC bank. Potential advantages could be the realisation of informational synergies, cross-selling opportunities, better serving of the upper wealth management clients, reducing agency problems and a better brand image. Additionally, it would be in line with KBC Securities' vision of serving companies in every stage of their lifecycle. (2) Cross-selling in KBC Securities: We focus on how private, corporate and investment bankers should work together to generate more revenues as a whole. We elaborate on the importance of knowledge training, good incentive systems, alignment of every party involved, proper internal communication systems and the support of senior management to effectively realise cross-selling opportunities within the bank. (3) Organisational set-up of the corporate finance team: For the reason that ECM activities and M&A activities serve different type of clients, require different skills and networks to grow, we believe (after performing research and conducting interviews with industry experts) that it would be better to split up the corporate finance team into two separate teams: an ECM team and a M&A team. (4) Convertible bonds: As KBC Securities currently has no in-house expertise regarding convertible bonds, we want to encourage KBC Securities' management to consider if it is worth starting this activity. Chapter 6 is the conclusion of the In-Company Project. Moreover, the research question which was presented in chapter 1, is answered. KBC Securities should implement customer intimacy as a strategy in order to stay relevant. Furthermore, the following limitations of this project were discussed in this chapter, namely: the limited number of conducted interviews, the limited amount of available academic research regarding the research question and the time constraint. We emphasised that this project is a purely strategic exercise (formulation), with limited focus on strategy execution. As a result, compliance, risk, regulation and operation-related matters are out of the scope of this project. This chapter finishes with some actions for KBC Securities going forward. The formulation of a sound strategy, as presented in this report, was only a first step in becoming a customer intimate bank that puts the client at the centre of everything it does. However, there still is a long way to go. Next steps for KBC Securities should focus on the actual execution and implementation of this strategy across the investment bank, with impact on its day-to-day operations. In chapter 7, additional research is conducted on the sell-side research function. MiFID II will have a major impact on sell-side research firms. Buy-side firms will become much more selective in deciding which research reports to buy and the budgets for research will likely decline, which means quality becomes the key differentiator. Additionally, competition is expected to increase. We conclude that KBC Securities should position itself as a regional champion where they should leverage their home field advantage in the Benelux to compete with other sell-side firms covering the same stocks. Lastly, we conclude that artificial intelligence and technology will be important in the future and that research analysts should focus more on client-facing activities instead of performing basic written research. KBC Securities should take actions to make sure analysts' time is spent on activities that are valued by the client and activities that the client wants to pay for, instead of spending most of their time on less-valued activities",,How can KBC securities and KBC markets stay relevant in the future?,,,,core

The specific lab in which we have conducted the research projects we refer to in this paper is the LaRePE 2 (LAboratoire de REcherche sur la Performance des Entreprises). This lab is mainly concerned with the development of scientific expertise on the study and modeling of SMEs' performance, including a variety of interrelated subjects such as finance, management , information systems, production, technology, etc. The vast majority of research projects carried out at the LaRePE involves both theoretical and practical aspects, often necessitating in-field studies with SMEs.

54535597,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Questo volume vuole evidenziare l’importanza di una modellizzazione

dei rischi bancari, in particolare di quelli associati all’attività di

credito e di negoziazione in titoli da parte della banca, che sia coerente

con le caratteristiche empiriche dei dati finanziari che, attualmente, non

sembrano confermare l’ipotesi tradizionale di normalità dei rendimenti.

Se la validità di un modello finanziario poggia sulla veridicità delle sue

ipotesi sottostanti, è anche vero che il contributo operativo di un modello

teorico è legato alla sua facilità d’implementazione e al suo basso sforzo

computazionale. Nella prima parte del volume si presentano, quindi,

dei modelli avanzati ma, allo stesso tempo, semplici da implementare

finalizzati ad una stima più realistica e “coerente” dell’ammontare dei

rischi di credito e di mercato dell’attività bancaria; nella seconda parte del

volume si descrivono dei modelli di gestione degli stessi rischi basati su un

approccio di portafoglio in cui le soluzioni del problema di minimizzazione

del rischio possono suggerire alla banca come riallocare coerentemente

il proprio capitale tra le diverse attività migliorando allo stesso tempo il

proprio profilo di rischio e rendimento. Successivamente questi modelli

sono stati implementati ai dati finanziari, reali e simulati, per testare il

grado di performance degli stessi in un’ottica comparativa con i modelli

più tradizionali utilizzati dall’industria finanziaria internazionale.This book aims to highlight the importance of a banking risk modeling, in particular of the financial risks associated with the activity of lending and trading in securities from the bank, which is consistent with the empirical characteristics of financial data that currently do not seem to confirm the traditional hypothesis of normality distribution. If the validity of a financial model is based on the truthfulness of his assumptions, it is also true that its operational contribution is related to the ease of implementation and its low computational efforts.

Therefore, in the first part of this volume we present some advanced models but, at the same time, simple to implement aimed at a more realistic and “coherent” estimate of the amount of credit and market risks of the banking activity. In the second part of this volume, we describe some advanced risk management models based on a portfolio approach. Le solutions of the portfolio risk minimization problem may suggest to the banking managers how consistently reallocate the total capital among the various financial assets improving the banking risk-return profile. Subsequently these same models have been implemented to financial data, real and simulated, in order to test the degree of performance of these models in a comparative perspective with some more traditional approaches used currently by the international financial industry.

In conclusion, we find in our experiments that the CVaR measure is a risk metric superior to the traditional VaR, overall in a perspective of financial risk management. In fact, only the CVaR is able to taking into account the diversification effects in terms of portfolio risk mitigation. In addition, we underline the utility of using copula functions for modeling the dependence structure among the assets in portfolio. In particular, this is true in the case of the Student’s t-copulas that by means of the tail dependence property are able to capture the “extreme” events of joint defaults.

304231865,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Hidden Markov Models, usually referred to as HMMs, are one of the most successful concepts in statistical modeling conceived and analyzed in the last 40 years. They belong to the stochastic mixture models family and have been broadly implemented in numerous sectors to address the problem of data model fitting and forecasting. Their structure usually is comprised by an observed sequence which is conditioned on an underlying hidden (unobserved) process. This way HMMs provide flexibility to address various complicated problems and can be implemented for modeling univariate and multivariate financial time series. Moreover, based on current literature, economic variables exhibit patterns dependent on different economic regimes which can be successfully captured by HMMs. Their parsimonious structure and attractive properties along with the existence of efficient algorithms for their estimation were the main drivers for the selection of HMM as the main topic of this thesis. Consequently, in this thesis we thoroughly investigate HMMs and their capabilities to simulate financial systems. The contribution of this study is threefold: First we perform an extensive review of HMM theory and applications. Our aim is to summarize the most significant applications of HMM with special focus in the field of finance. We offer a thorough and compact summary of the uses and the results of HMM in the last 40 years. Secondly, we extend the framework of HMMs by proposing a theoretical variation, injecting greater flexibility in their structure.  Based on bibliography, in many real-world scenarios the modeled data entail temporal dynamics the patterns of which change over time. We address this problem by proposing a novel HMM formulation, treating temporal dependencies as latent variables over which inference is performed. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical graphical model comprising two hidden layers: on the first layer, we postulate a chain of latent observation-emitting states, the temporal dependencies between which may change over time; on the second layer, we postulate a latent first-order Markov chain modeling the evolution of temporal dynamics (dependence jumps) pertaining to the first-layer latent process. As a result of this construction, our method allows for effectively modeling non-homogeneous observed financial data. Finally in the third part of this thesis we investigate the HMM efficiency in the problem of corporate credit scoring. We propose a novel corporate credit rating system based on Student’s-t hidden Markov models (SHMMs). Corporate credit scoring is widely used by financial institutions for portfolio risk management, and for pricing financial products designed for corporations. In addition, from a regulatory perspective, internal rating models are commonly used for establishing a more risk-sensitive capital adequacy framework for financial institutions. We evaluate our method against other state of the art statistical techniques like Neural Networks, SVM, and logistic regression and conclude that SHMM offer significant improved forecasting capabilities",,Hidden Markov models and their applications in finance,,,,core

201554895,2018-10-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Background Logistic regression is a popular technique used in machine learning to construct classification models. Since the construction of such models is based on computing with large datasets, it is an appealing idea to outsource this computation to a cloud service. The privacy-sensitive nature of the input data requires appropriate privacy preserving measures before outsourcing it. Homomorphic encryption enables one to compute on encrypted data directly, without decryption and can be used to mitigate the privacy concerns raised by using a cloud service. Methods In this paper, we propose an algorithm (and its implementation) to train a logistic regression model on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. The core of our algorithm consists of a new iterative method that can be seen as a simplified form of the fixed Hessian method, but with a much lower multiplicative complexity. Results We test the new method on two interesting real life applications: the first application is in medicine and constructs a model to predict the probability for a patient to have cancer, given genomic data as input; the second application is in finance and the model predicts the probability of a credit card transaction to be fraudulent. The method produces accurate results for both applications, comparable to running standard algorithms on plaintext data. Conclusions This article introduces a new simple iterative algorithm to train a logistic regression model that is tailored to be applied on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. This algorithm can be used as a privacy-preserving technique to build a binary classification model and can be applied in a wide range of problems that can be modelled with logistic regression. Our implementation results show that our method can handle the large datasets used in logistic regression training",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Privacy-preserving logistic regression training,,10.1186/s12920-018-0398-y,"[{'title': 'BMC Medical Genomics', 'identifiers': ['1755-8794', 'issn:1755-8794']}]",core

Western's Learning Communities
Helping Freshmen Find a Niche
Jr Dining in takes on
a new dimension
July 1 at Western
with a changeover4
in food services. ARAMARK
Corp. has been selected to operate
the university's campus dining
services, including those at
Dodson and Brown cafeterias, the
food court areas at Hinds
University Center and Dodson,
concessions at the Ramsey
Regional Activity Center, and
catering services throughout
the campus.
Among the changes expected
under ARAMARKs management
are new menus and formats
providing a wide variety of student
dining options. These include addi­tional
nationally known franchises,
such as Starbucks Coffee and Little
Ceasars Pizza, as well as demon­stration
cooking areas where
customers can watch as their food
is prepared, and expansion of full
menu cafeteria-style service and
""grab-and-go"" items.
Clete Myers, operations
manager of food services at
Clemson University, will become
general manager of campus dining
services at Western. ARAMARK
hopes to retain personnel currently
employed in WClFs food service
when the management change
occurs.
Retention Services Director Susan Clarke Smith (far right) and Peer Mentor
Bryan Dodge (center), meet entering LC students.
""An institution's capacity to retain students is directly related to its ability to reach out and make
contact with students and integrate them into the social and intellectual fabric of institutional life.
It hinges on the establishment of a healthy, caring environment which enables individuals to find a
niche in the social and intellectual communities of the institution."" —VINCENT TINTO IN LEAVING COLLEGE
a ±JL good many of us came of age
when linking the notion of caring
with any institution would have been
greeted with skepticism—if not out­right
scorn. But Western, changing
with, and in many instances ahead of,
the times, will set the standard for
high tech and high touch this fall.
By embracing the idea of learning
communities as part of its freshman
year experience program, Western
makes use of a proven method for
meeting both the individual's need
to belong and the institution's need
to retain.
Randomly selected as participants
in the Learning Community (or LC
Pilot) project beginning this fall, some
170 of Western's estimated 1,200
first-year students will live together
and learn together in classes linked to
their common interests and conduct­ed
by a core group of instructors—all
in an effort to address the problems
presented by the transition from high
school to college. Meanwhile, the
institution will look closely to see if
the initiative addresses its own prob­lems
associated with an unusually
high rate of student attrition,
particularly after the first year.
Frank Prochaska, associate vice
chancellor for academic affairs and
chief architect of the LC Pilot project,
believes that establishing learning
communities at Western, even on a
limited basis initially, will deliver on
both counts. The numbers would
appear to bear him out, with
universities where LCs have become
a standard for first-year programs
reporting significantly higher GPAs
and retention rates among students
who participate.
Elizabeth Shelly coordinates the
Freshman Year Experience Program
through Student Affairs and is herself
a product of an undergraduate LC.
Shelly describes it as setting out in
college life with an ""instant group of
friends"" to go to at any time for
support. She explains that Western's
approach to the idea conforms to a
pretty standard model but incorporates
some new features made possible by
our unique environment.
The pilot group is divided into eight
communities of about twenty students
each, with several of the communities
grouped according to a declared major
or according to undergraduate college.
Three LCs are made up of freshmen
undecided upon majors. Each LC will
be housed in a suite-style layout in
Walker Hall with common areas set
aside for studying and group
activities. In addition to a resident
assistant on the floor, each commu­nity
will be assigned an upperclass
peer mentor who will live with the
group and work with the USI130
class designed for it.
A revamped USI course is key to
the LC Pilot, according to Prochaska.
The USI 130 course for the individual
communities will be co-taught by a
faculty member and a student affairs
professional, both trained in freshman
issues. Themes introduced for
discussion in this course will carry
over to the other General Education
courses linked for the purposes of each
community and taught by specially
selected instructors. For example,
Instructor Nory Prochaska's USI 130
section, and its linked English,
continued on page 2
Learning, continued
computer science, and math courses,
will examine the advantages and
disadvantages of the ""virtual
university"" idea, from the perspective
of LC students who have a particular
interest in technology and a close
comfort with using electronic media.
Susan Clarke Smith, director of
Retention Services, sees the linked
courses as an effective means of
addressing the ""intimidation factor,""
identified by most retention experts
such as Vincent Tinto as one of the
main reasons students leave college.
Smith asserts that by establishing
opportunities for interaction in and
out of the classroom, students and
faculty can begin to ""break down
barriers."" Smith says, ""Students can
see that their professors are human,
and faculty can feel less hesitation, as
part of a wider network of support, to
communicate concern on a more
personal level.""
To some extent, we need look no
farther than our own campus for an
example of a learning community
beginning to deliver on its promise.
Now entering its second year, The
Honors College combines an academic
emphasis with a residential and social
component. Brian Railsback, acting
dean of the college, calculates a 92
percent fall-spring retention rate for
honors freshmen for 1997-98. (The
university's rate for freshmen was
83 percent.) ""That figure,"" Railsback
says, ""obviously points to a good bond
and a real desire for these students to
stay together.""
Perhaps the most ambitious and
the most advantageous aspects of
initiating a learning community
program now come to a confluence
with the computer implementation
project, also spearheaded by
Prochaska. Student Affairs Vice
Chancellor Robert Caruso sees the
efforts as quite extraordinary. ""The
added component of new technologies
in the classroom and the residence
halls will revolutionize our whole
notion of community,"" Caruso says.
""With something on the order of only
forty higher education institutions
out of about 2,800 nationwide that
have a computer requirement, I think
everyone is going to be looking to
Western as a model for creating the
learning community of the twenty-first
century.""

Architects Tapped for Construction Projects
A pair of major construction projects planned for Western moved closer to reality
recently with the board of trustees' selection of two Charlotte architecture firms
to design an expansion of the university center and a federally funded workforce
development facility.
The trustees named Lee Nichols Hepler Architecture of Charlotte to design
the expansion of the Hinds University Center and Jenkins-Peer Architects of
Charlotte to design the proposed new Western North Carolina laborforce high-technology
education and training center.
The Hinds University Center project is the second in a three-phased
expansion effort designed to enhance the quality of student life at WCU. Plans
call for the construction of approximately 31,000 additional square feet to add a
retail shopping area, a movie theater, increased meeting and office space for
student organizations, and a multicultural center. Preliminary estimates for the
expansion set the cost at about $4.5 million.
The regional high-tech workforce training center, announced last fall by U.S.
Rep. Charles Taylor, is designed to help raise the economic potential of the
region by improving the availability of high-technology education to the
mountains' workforce. The center could include such high-tech training tools as
an industrial laser lab, artificial intelligence lab, geographic information lab,
robotics training, and sound and video production facilities complete with digital
editing capabilities. The facility, pending funding from Congress and the federal
Economic Development Administration, is expected to be built adjacent to the
Belk Building.
Michael Dougherty, associate dean of
the College of Education and Allied
Professions, has been named by
WClFs board of trustees to succeed
Gurney E. Chambers as dean.
Appointment of Dougherty to the
dean's post was approved by the
board Wednesday, June 10, at its
quarterly meeting. The appointment

Chancellor's Distinguished
Teaching Award
Katie Ray joined WCU's faculty
in 1994 after seven years of teaching
in elementary and middle schools in
New York City. In presenting the
award, Bardo quoted from Ray's
comments to the awards selection
committee.
""For students to be great
teachers, they must be passionate
about living and learning,"" Ray said.
""Consequently, I must show
students by my own passion. The
challenge I face every day is not to
know about good teaching, but to
demonstrate it in every interaction I
have with my students.""

Without information technology, it is already impossible to imagine either medicine or the field of education. Big data and artificial intelligence come to almost every area of society, everything around is becoming “smart”. According to the forecasts of the participants of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, held in 2019, the global market for products using artificial intelligence and advanced information technologies can grow by almost 17 times by 2024. A national strategy for the development of technologies in the field of artificial intelligence and information technologies has been prepared in the Russian Federation, and a detailed action plan has been integrated into the national program “Digital Economy”. Digitalization today covers almost all aspects of the interaction of the citizen and business with authorities. Digitalization of business processes takes place, technologies are introduced into the activities of industrial enterprises, in the organization of public services and financial institutions.Aim. Consider the technology of blockchain, its origin, advantages and disadvantages, as well as the possibilities and prospects of using this technology.Materials and methods. As part of the materials and methods, one should point to an analysis of the theoretical foundations of the blockchain technology, the practical results of its implementation and use in various fields of activity: from public life to business.

211456666,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"One of the most important problems in the retail banking sector is that of evaluating the creditworthiness of credit applicants. This problem is addressed by the methodology of credit scoring. The methodology of credit scoring involves the construction of models (i.e. credit scoring models) which classify each credit applicant into one of two classes: the class of applicants who are predicted not to default with their obligations and are granted credit and the class of applicants who are predicted to default with their obligations and are not granted credit. The goal of this thesis is to study the methodology of credit scoring and how this methodology can be implemented by means of computer software applications. In pursuing this goal, this thesis examines the theoretical background of the methodology of credit scoring and analyzes credit scoring data by means of the XLMiner software package and constructed software templates. Within the framework of credit scoring data analysis, methods used for the construction of credit scoring models are assessed. Particular emphasis is given into the method known as the Naive (Simple) Bayes Rule (NBR). Specifically, a real-world credit scoring data set from a major Greek bank is used to benchmark NBR against linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, classification trees and k-nearest neighbours. Five partitions of this data set into training and test sets are used. Predictive ability is measured by the percentage of correctly classified cases and the bad rate amongst accepts. NBR appears to have a lower predictive ability than the other methods under both the aforementioned predictive ability measures. This result may be attributed to properties inherent in the field of credit scoring, i.e. significant dependence given the class of the variables used in this field and large training set sizes. The results allow the application of NBR as a method for the construction of credit scoring models, because of the small (statistically non-significant) differences in predictive ability between the methods and the simplicity of NBR.Ένα από τα σημαντικότερα προβλήματα στον τομέα της λιανικής τραπεζικής είναι αυτό της εκτίμησης της πιστοληπτικής ικανότητας των υποψηφίων πιστούχων. Η σχετική μεθοδολογία (μεθοδολογία Credit Scoring, στο εξής: μεθοδολογία CS) αφορά την κατασκευή υποδειγμάτων (υποδειγμάτων CS) τα οποία ταξινομούν κάθε υποψήφιο πιστούχο σε μία από δύο πιθανές κλάσεις: την κλάση των υποψηφίων που προβλέπεται να μην αθετήσουν τις υποχρεώσεις τους και δανειοδοτούνται και την κλάση των υποψηφίων που προβλέπεται να αθετήσουν τις υποχρεώσεις τους και δεν δανειοδοτούνται. Στόχος της παρούσας διατριβής είναι η μελέτη της μεθοδολογίας CS και της δυνατότητας υλοποίησής της με τη βοήθεια εφαρμογών πληροφορικών πακέτων. Αναλυτικότερα, γίνεται μελέτη του θεωρητικού υποβάθρου της μεθοδολογίας CS και ανάλυση δεδομένων μέσω του πακέτου XLMiner και μέσω δημιουργηθέντων προτύπων λογισμικού. Στα πλαίσια της ανάλυσης δεδομένων γίνεται αξιολόγηση μεθόδων κατασκευής υποδειγμάτων CS, με ιδιαίτερη έμφαση στην αξιολόγηση της μεθόδου του Κανόνα του Απλού Bayes (KAB). Συγκεκριμένα, συγκρίνεται επί τη βάσει πραγματικών δεδομένων μεγάλης ελληνικής τράπεζας, o ΚΑΒ με τη Γραμμική Διαχωριστική (Διακριτική) Ανάλυση, τη Λογαριθμική (Λογιστική) Παλινδρόμηση, τα Νευρωνικά Δίκτυα, τα Δένδρα Ταξινόμησης και τη Μέθοδο των k Πλησιέστερων Γειτονικών Σημείων. Χρησιμοποιούνται πέντε διαμερίσεις των δεδομένων σε δείγματα σχεδιασμού και δείγματα ελέγχου. Η προβλεπτική ικανότητα αξιολογείται επί τη βάσει του ποσοστού των σωστά ταξινομημένων πιστούχων και του ποσοστού των «κακών» πιστούχων μεταξύ αυτών που γίνονται δεκτοί. Σύμφωνα και με τα δύο παραπάνω κριτήρια, ο ΚΑΒ φαίνεται να παρουσιάζει προβλεπτική ικανότητα μικρότερη από αυτήν των υπολοίπων μεθόδων. Το αποτέλεσμα αυτό μπορεί να αποδοθεί σε δύο παράγοντες που χαρακτηρίζουν το πεδίο του CS, το σημαντικό βαθμό εξάρτησης δεδομένης της κλάσης των χρησιμοποιούμενων μεταβλητών και το μεγάλο μέγεθος των χρησιμοποιούμενων δειγμάτων σχεδιασμού",'National Documentation Centre (EKT)',Computer science applications in the assessment of methods used for the construction of credit scoring models in the retail banking sector,,10.12681/eadd/18638,,core

Identified and classified the main reasons affecting the unsuccessful completion of projects. The components of the proposed model for integrating the project management system are shown and their detailed characteristics are presented. It is determined that the proposed model is based on three components, including a list of basic methodologies and standards for project management, which can form hybrid methodologies, a set of IT, database and project management knowledge for developing, substantiating and managing projects and modern artificial technologies intelligence based on the use of machine learning methods. The role, components and environment of machine learning for use in project management is substantiated. The integration conditions were used to analyze and build a table of modern IT for project management, clustering them into three groups concerning the possibilities of using artificial intelligence technologies, in particular machine learning. The results of introducing elements of the proposed model in the implementation of complex IT projects in the banking sector have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

serious felonies (1.7-4 trillion euros annually) such as drug dealing, human
trafficking, or corruption. The anti-money laundering systems deployed by
financial institutions typically comprise rules aligned with regulatory
frameworks. Human investigators review the alerts and report suspicious cases.
Such systems suffer from high false-positive rates, undermining their
effectiveness and resulting in high operational costs. We propose a machine
learning triage model, which complements the rule-based system and learns to
predict the risk of an alert accurately. Our model uses both entity-centric
engineered features and attributes characterizing inter-entity relations in the
form of graph-based features. We leverage time windows to construct the dynamic
graph, optimizing for time and space efficiency. We validate our model on a
real-world banking dataset and show how the triage model can reduce the number
of false positives by 80% while detecting over 90% of true positives. In this
way, our model can significantly improve anti-money laundering operations.Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure",,"Anti-Money Laundering Alert Optimization Using Machine Learning with

This is shown not only by setting up a theoretical framework, but also by a real world application: the calculation of banking fees. We tackle the problems of deciding whether such a rule set is total and deterministic, i.e. does it permit calculation of a fee for every business deal, and can only one fee be computed in each case. Although these questions are undecidable in general, the restricted form of the investigated rule sets makes them decidable and even tractable in practise. Experiences with our system implemented in Prolog as well as some questions one may have with the application are discussed.  Keywords.

В результате исследования установлено, что эффективное функционирование механизма обеспечения киберустойчивости требует соответствующего организационного обеспечения, в частности создания Центра киберустойчивости банка.The article proves the importance of forming the concept of ensuring the cyber resilience of banks at the present stage of development of the country's digital economy in the transition to the sixth technological mode and the associated use of industry 4.0 technologies, such as artificial intelligence, «cloud» and «foggy» computing, IoT / IIoT, Big Data, Blockchain, VR / AR. This leads to a significant complication of the cyber threat landscape, an increase in the number of cyberattacks with a significant increase in the negative financial and non-financial consequences that cyberattacks have on the banking system and the economy as a whole. The author, based on the generalization of research on this topic, clarified the content of the concept of ""cyber resilience of a bank"". Its essential characteristics were determined in the context of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The article studies theoretical approaches to ensuring the cyber resilience of banks, which made it possible to develop a conceptual model of the mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience, adequate to the current state and conditions in which the banks of Ukraine operate. The developed mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience allows for: 1) the formalization of the landscape of real and potential cyber threats; 2) ensures the consistency of mechanisms and tools for countering them, adapting and/or recovering from cyber incidents; 3) allows not only to adequately respond to existing cyber threats but also to identify negative factors that can lead to the emergence and implementation of new cyber threats and cyber-attacks. According to the results of the study, it was found that the effective functioning of the mechanism for ensuring the cyber resilience of the bank requires appropriate organizational support. For this, the author substantiated the need to create a Bank Cyber Resilience Center. It should include representatives from the departments responsible for banking business continuity, cybersecurity, cyber risk management and IT quality. This will allow obtaining a synergistic effect by creating a single interconnected process-based model, including metrics of the bank's cyber resilience level and KPIs, as well as tools for monitoring, controlling and resisting external and internal cyber threats, adaptation and/or recovery after them",'DKS Center',Теорія та практика забезпечення кіберстійкості банків,https://core.ac.uk/download/395139328.pdf,10.32702/2307-2105-2020.10.50,,core

I ! 1996 New Year Resolution ! !
Getting Started - Pre-Authorized Savings Plans
(An Easy Way To Keep Your Resolution)
If you're like most people, every year about this time you start thinking of New Year's resolutions.
If you are like most people, by the time the end of Jan. rolls around, your resolutions are as much a
part of history as the old year.
If one of your resolutions for 1996 is to start a savings plan to improve your financial health, here
are some tips to help you keep your resolve. First, the sooner you start the better. Consider the case
of the 23 yr old & the 31 yr old who each decide to start saving $100 per month. The 23 yr old keeps
doing it for 9 yrs. & then stops, having saved $10,800 which is invested until age 65. The 31 yr old
keeps putting aside $100 a month until age 65, saving a total of $42,000. Despite the perseverance,
the 31 yr old never does catch up with the 23 yr old. Assuming both earned an average annual return
on their savings of 8%, at age 65 the 31 yr old's $42,000 has turned into $229,400, the 23 yr old's
$10,800 has turned into $236,800. Obviously the sooner you start the better.
Whatever age you start at however, the other key is regularity. A pre-authorized savings plan can
be set up to put aside a fixed amount at regular intervals. This can be quarterly, monthly, weekly or
whatever interval fits your situation. By making your saving regular its easier to keep that resolution.
Another secret is to get your money invested as soon as possible and keep it invested. A good
approach is to use your pre-authorized purchase plan to make regular contributions to a family of
mutual funds. You can do this for as little as $25 per Fund which allows you to allocate your savings
into several different types of investments to match your own personal financial objectives.
So if you want to keep your financial resolution this year: start now, save regularly, stay invested
and allocate your savings. Contributed by Toronto-Dominion Bank Investment Hotline.

THE MEDICINE
GG DOWN
How can you get your
kids to take yucky-tast-ing
medicines? Phar­macist
Andy Ullrich
recommends:
® Chilling liquid medi­cine
in your refrigerator
(ask your phar macist
if this is okay) to take
the edge off a bitter or
unpleasant taste.
SS Mixing a teaspoon of
com syrup with liquid
medicine to sweeten a
sour taste.
• Offering something
sweet and strong, like
grape juice, right after
the medicine to coun­teract
its aftertaste.
Lolliop Trick
If your child is
complaining of a sore
throat but won't let
you look inside her
mouth, try using a
lollipop as a tongue
depressor. She'll
think it's a treat, and
you'll have a
cooperative patient.
Don't forget to hand
the lollipop over as a
reward.

Treating Carbon
Monoxide Poisoning
When a heating appliance
isn't vented properly, carbon
monoxide gas - odorless,
colorless and toxic-can build
up. Oxygen is the antidote:
some patients may need
treatment in a hyperbaric
chamber, a cylinder into
which doctors pump a
megadose of pressurized
pure oxygen.
The best strategy though is to
be proactive, installing
carbon monoxide detectors-especially
outside sleeping
areas-can salve lives.

211481279,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Hidden Markov Models, usually referred to as HMMs, are one of the most successful concepts in statistical modeling conceived and analyzed in the last 40 years. They belong to the stochastic mixture models family and have been broadly implemented in numerous sectors to address the problem of data model fitting and forecasting. Their structure usually is comprised by an observed sequence which is conditioned on an underlying hidden (unobserved) process. This way HMMs provide flexibility to address various complicated problems and can be implemented for modeling univariate and multivariate financial time series. Moreover, based on current literature, economic variables exhibit patterns dependent on different economic regimes which can be successfully captured by HMMs. Their parsimonious structure and attractive properties along with the existence of efficient algorithms for their estimation were the main drivers for the selection of HMM as the main topic of this thesis. Consequently, in this thesis we thoroughly investigate HMMs and their capabilities to simulate financial systems. The contribution of this study is threefold: First we perform an extensive review of HMM theory and applications. Our aim is to summarize the most significant applications of HMM with special focus in the field of finance. We offer a thorough and compact summary of the uses and the results of HMM in the last 40 years. Secondly, we extend the framework of HMMs by proposing a theoretical variation, injecting greater flexibility in their structure.  Based on bibliography, in many real-world scenarios the modeled data entail temporal dynamics the patterns of which change over time. We address this problem by proposing a novel HMM formulation, treating temporal dependencies as latent variables over which inference is performed. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical graphical model comprising two hidden layers: on the first layer, we postulate a chain of latent observation-emitting states, the temporal dependencies between which may change over time; on the second layer, we postulate a latent first-order Markov chain modeling the evolution of temporal dynamics (dependence jumps) pertaining to the first-layer latent process. As a result of this construction, our method allows for effectively modeling non-homogeneous observed financial data. Finally in the third part of this thesis we investigate the HMM efficiency in the problem of corporate credit scoring. We propose a novel corporate credit rating system based on Student’s-t hidden Markov models (SHMMs). Corporate credit scoring is widely used by financial institutions for portfolio risk management, and for pricing financial products designed for corporations. In addition, from a regulatory perspective, internal rating models are commonly used for establishing a more risk-sensitive capital adequacy framework for financial institutions. We evaluate our method against other state of the art statistical techniques like Neural Networks, SVM, and logistic regression and conclude that SHMM offer significant improved forecasting capabilities",'National Documentation Centre (EKT)',Hidden Markov models και οι εφαρμογές τους στα χρηματοοικονομικά,,10.12681/eadd/36701,,core
