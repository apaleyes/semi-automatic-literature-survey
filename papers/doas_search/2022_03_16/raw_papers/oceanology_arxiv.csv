  with physics-constrained deep learning","The complexity of real-world geophysical systems is often compounded by the
fact that the observed measurements depend on hidden variables. These latent
variables include unresolved small scales and/or rapidly evolving processes,
partially observed couplings, or forcings in coupled systems. This is the case
in ocean-atmosphere dynamics, for which unknown interior dynamics can affect
surface observations. The identification of computationally-relevant
representations of such partially-observed and highly nonlinear systems is thus
challenging and often limited to short-term forecast applications. Here, we
investigate the physics-constrained learning of implicit dynamical embeddings,
leveraging neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) representations. A key
objective is to constrain their boundedness, which promotes the generalization
of the learned dynamics to arbitrary initial condition. The proposed
architecture is implemented within a deep learning framework, and its relevance
is demonstrated with respect to state-of-the-art schemes for different
case-studies representative of geophysical dynamics.",arxiv

  Neural Networks","Critical evaluation and understanding of ship responses in the ocean is
important for not only the design and engineering of future platforms but also
the operation and safety of those that are currently deployed. Simulations or
experiments are typically performed in nominal sea conditions during ship
design or prior to deployment and the results may not be reflective of the
instantaneous state of the vessel and the ocean environment while deployed.
Short-term temporal predictions of ship responses given the current wave
environment and ship state would enable enhanced decision-making onboard for
both manned and unmanned vessels. However, the current state-of-the-art in
numerical hydrodynamic simulation tools are too computationally expensive to be
employed for real-time ship motion forecasting and the computationally
efficient tools are too low fidelity to provide accurate responses. A
methodology is developed with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to
represent the motions of a free running David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5415
destroyer operating at 20 knots in Sea State 7 stern-quartering irregular seas.
Case studies are performed for both course-keeping and turning circle
scenarios. An estimate of the vessel's encounter frame is made with the
trajectories observed in the training dataset. Wave elevation time histories
are given by artificial wave probes that travel with the estimated encounter
frame and serve as input into the neural network, while the output is the 6-DOF
temporal ship motion response. Overall, the neural network is able to predict
the temporal response of the ship due to unseen waves accurately, which makes
this methodology suitable for system identification and real-time ship motion
forecasting. The methodology, the dependence of model accuracy on wave probe
and training data quantity and the estimated encounter frame are all detailed.",arxiv

the low-light image enhancement task, one critical problem of CNNs is the
paradox of model complexity and performance. This paper presents a novel
SurroundNet which only involves less than 150$K$ parameters (about 80-98
percent size reduction compared to SOTAs) and achieves very competitive
performance. The proposed network comprises several Adaptive Retinex Blocks
(ARBlock), which can be viewed as a novel extension of Single Scale Retinex in
feature space. The core of our ARBlock is an efficient illumination estimation
function called Adaptive Surround Function (ASF). It can be regarded as a
general form of surround functions and be implemented by convolution layers. In
addition, we also introduce a Low-Exposure Denoiser (LED) to smooth the
low-light image before the enhancement. We evaluate the proposed method on the
real-world low-light dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the
superiority of our submitted SurroundNet in both performance and network
parameters against State-of-the-Art low-light image enhancement methods. Code

  Underwater Vehicles With Limited Sensor Payloads","This paper presents a deep learning approach to aid dead-reckoning (DR)
navigation using a limited sensor suite. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was
developed to predict the relative horizontal velocities of an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using data from an IMU, pressure sensor, and control
inputs. The RNN network is trained using experimental data, where a doppler
velocity logger (DVL) provided ground truth velocities. The predictions of the
relative velocities were implemented in a dead-reckoning algorithm to
approximate north and east positions. The studies in this paper were twofold I)
Experimental data from a Long-Range AUV was investigated. Datasets from a
series of surveys in Monterey Bay, California (U.S) were used to train and test
the RNN network. II) The second study explore datasets generated by a simulated
autonomous underwater glider. Environmental variables e.g ocean currents were
implemented in the simulation to reflect real ocean conditions. The proposed
neural network approach to DR navigation was compared to the on-board
navigation system and ground truth simulated positions.",arxiv

increasing amount of research effort due to its significance in underwater
robotics and ocean engineering. Research has evolved from implementing
physics-based solutions to using very deep CNNs and GANs. However, these
state-of-art algorithms are computationally expensive and memory intensive.
This hinders their deployment on portable devices for underwater exploration
tasks. These models are trained on either synthetic or limited real world
datasets making them less practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper we
propose a shallow neural network architecture, \textbf{Shallow-UWnet} which
maintains performance and has fewer parameters than the state-of-art models. We
also demonstrated the generalization of our model by benchmarking its
performance on combination of synthetic and real-world datasets.",arxiv

answering (QA), they are still suffering from heavy computational and energy
cost for real product deployment. Further, existing QA systems are bottlenecked
by the encoding time of real-time questions with neural networks, thus
suffering from detectable latency in deployment for large-volume traffic. To
reduce the computational cost and accelerate real-time question answering
(RTQA) for practical usage, we propose to remove all the neural networks from
online QA systems, and present Ocean-Q (an Ocean of Questions), which
introduces a new question generation (QG) model to generate a large pool of QA
pairs offline, then in real time matches an input question with the candidate
QA pool to predict the answer without question encoding. Ocean-Q can be readily
deployed in existing distributed database systems or search engine for
large-scale query usage, and much greener with no additional cost for
maintaining large neural networks. Experiments on SQuAD(-open) and HotpotQA
benchmarks demonstrate that Ocean-Q is able to accelerate the fastest
state-of-the-art RTQA system by 4X times, with only a 3+% accuracy drop.",arxiv

  Ship-based Real-Time Recognition and Localization of Marine Mammals - Machine
  Learning Detection Algorithms","Overarching goals for this work aim to advance the state of the art for
detection, classification and localization (DCL) in the field of bioacoustics.
This goal is primarily achieved by building a generic framework for
detection-classification (DC) using a fast, efficient and scalable
architecture, demonstrating the capabilities of this system using on a variety
of low-frequency mid-frequency cetacean sounds. Two primary goals are to
develop transferable technologies for detection and classification in, one: the
area of advanced algorithms, such as deep learning and other methods; and two:
advanced systems, capable of real-time and archival processing. For each key
area, we will focus on producing publications from this work and providing
tools and software to the community where/when possible. Currently massive
amounts of acoustic data are being collected by various institutions,
corporations and national defense agencies. The long-term goal is to provide
technical capability to analyze the data using automatic algorithms for (DC)
based on machine intelligence. The goal of the automation is to provide
effective and efficient mechanisms by which to process large acoustic datasets
for understanding the bioacoustic behaviors of marine mammals. This capability
will provide insights into the potential ecological impacts and influences of
anthropogenic ocean sounds. This work focuses on building technologies using a
maturity model based on DARPA 6.1 and 6.2 processes, for basic and applied
research, respectively.",arxiv
