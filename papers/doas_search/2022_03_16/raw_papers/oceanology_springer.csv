In many cases, the nature of the variation of these characteristics in time is important to design and assess the risk to offshore structures, but a persistent problem is that measurements are sparse and time history simulations using metocean models are computationally onerous. Surrogate modeling is an appealing approach to ease the computational burden of metocean modeling; however, modeling the time-dependency of metocean conditions using surrogate models is challenging because the conditions at one time instant are dependent on not only the conditions at that instant but also on the conditions at previous time instances. In this paper, time-dependent surrogate modeling of significant wave height, peak wave period, peak wave direction, and storm surge is explored using a database of metocean conditions at an offshore site. Three types of surrogate models, including Kriging, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and recurrent neural network with gated recurrent unit (RNN-GRU), are evaluated, with two different time-dependent structures considered for the Kriging model and two training set sizes for the MLP model, resulting in a total of five models evaluated in this paper. The performance of the models is compared in terms of accuracy and sensitivity toward hyperparameters, and the MLP and RNN-GRU models are demonstrated to have extraordinary prediction performance in this context.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-021-05002-2,springer

Ocean temperature is a key indicator of global climate change. The anomalies in ocean temperature have caused significant deterioration of marine systems. Existing works on surface temperature anomaly considered a suite of other remote sensing measurements such as wave height, salinity and models such as support vector machine, self-organizing maps and convolutional neural networks. Neural networks are used for predicting the surface temperature. This paper proposes use of long short-term memory, a recurrent neural network method to the estimate sea surface temperature anomalies based on previous year’s sea surface temperature anomalies. NOAA OI SST V2 dataset with 40 years of data is used in the experimentation. Auto-regression is used during data preprocessing. The basic LSTM method with 3 blocks of size 2 is enhanced to 50 neurons. This proposed LSTM model has been assessed for performance on time series data, yearly wise and for the entire dataset and found that the model has been able to predict the anomalies with a reasonably good precision. The model produced error of 0.036 indicating that the model is feasible for predicting the temperature anomaly and mean absolute error of 0.14 on the testing data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-021-06878-8,springer

The temperature structure of mesoscale eddies will lead to variations in oceanic baroclinity, which can be reflected in the sea level anomaly (SLA). Deep learning can automatically extract different features of data at multiple levels without human intervention, and find the hidden relations of data. Therefore, combining satellite SLA data with deep learning is a good way to invert the temperature structure inside eddies. This paper proposes a deep learning algorithm, eddy convolution neural network (ECN), which can train the relationship between mesoscale eddy temperature anomalies and sea level anomalies (SLAs), relying on the powerful feature extraction and learning abilities of convolutional neural networks. After obtaining the temperature structure model through ECN, according to climatic temperature data, the temperature structure of mesoscale eddies in the Northwest Pacific is retrieved with a spatial resolution of 0.25° at depths of 0–1 000 m. The overall accuracy of the ECN temperature structure is verified using Argo profiles at the locations of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies during 2015–2016. Taking 10% error as the acceptable threshold of accuracy, 89.64% and 87.25% of the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy temperature structures obtained by ECN met the threshold, respectively.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13131-021-1841-z,springer

Rock sampling and laboratory measurements are time-consuming and expensive, and are currently the main methods for dating seamounts. Thus, the ages of many seamounts in the Pacific Ocean are still unknown. To address this problem, gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, oceanic crustal ages, sediment thicknesses and seamount heights are chosen as the input parameters for seamount age prediction based on the potential relationship between geophysical observables and seamount ages. A Back-propagation (BP) neural network is constructed using the currently known seamount ages in the Pacific Ocean. Then, the weight and threshold of the BP network are optimized by a Genetic algorithm (GA); finally, the GA-BP model for seamount age production is derived. In addition, Convolutional neural network (CNN), BP model, and Support vector regression (SVR) methods are also used to predict seamount ages.

The coastal belts of the Indian peninsula are vulnerable to natural disasters like storm surges and inundations due to cyclones each year. The wind speed is a major parameter for analyzing extreme weather events. Prediction using numerical models is not efficient enough due to the irregular patterns in the data and, thus, deep neural network models involving many layers have been tested. The shallow feed-forward model has also been considered along with deep learning models to estimate future values from past data. The present work employs a comparison study of different models to forecast wind speed time series at two locations in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, respectively, having different dynamics and randomness. For training the models, daily wind speed data are considered for the period 2006–2017 and an independent validation set is chosen comprising 2018 wind speed data to check the accuracy. To evaluate forecast efficiency among different network models fitted to given time series, mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) have been computed. Multiple experiments are conducted with different hidden unit values and epoch values to obtain the minimum error. Regression equations generated may be used for forecasting future time series.

The absence of a formal forward market in container shipping necessitates reliance on forecasts, also for hedging purposes. To identify better performing forecasting approaches, we compare three models, namely autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregressive (VAR) or vector error correction (VEC), and artificial neural network (ANN) models. We examine the China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI) as a collection of weekly freight rates published by the Shanghai Shipping Exchange (SSE) for four major trade routes. We find that, overall, VAR/VEC models outperform ARIMA and ANN in training-sample forecasts, but ARIMA outperforms VAR and ANN taking test-samples. At route level, we observe two exceptions to this. ARIMA performs better for the Far East to Mediterranean route, in the training-sample, and the VEC model does the same in the Far East to US East Coast route in the test-sample. Hence, we advise industry players to use ARIMA for forecasting container freight rates for major trade routes ex-China, except for VEC in the case of the Far East to US East Coast route.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1057/s41278-020-00156-5,springer

Machine learning is driven by data. It learns from a part of the input data and builds a model. The model is used to predict and analyze another part of the data to get the results people want. With the continuous advancement of ocean observation technology, the amount of ocean data and data dimensions are rising sharply. The use of traditional data analysis methods to analyze massive amounts of data has revealed many shortcomings. The development of machine learning has solved these shortcomings. Nowadays, the use of machine learning technology to analyze and apply ocean data becomes the focus of scientific research.

The repeated synoptic observations of spectral leaving reflectance can be used to estimate marine inherent optical properties. The spatial, angular, and spectral distributions of underwater light field depend upon the absorption and scattering characteristics, the inherent optical properties (IOPs), of oceanic particles or hydrosols. The remote sensing algorithms or inverse methods typically rely on forward models to relate the satellite observed quantity, remote sensing reflectance, with the corresponding IOPs. The viewing angle dependence, spectral, and polarization states of reflected light contain rich information on the retrieval IOP parameters. The inverse methods depend on a reliable atmospheric correction algorithm. However, due to the presence of absorbing aerosols and complex optical properties of coastal waters, it is difficult to achieve successful atmospheric correction over coastal waters or when absorbing aerosols are involved. To overcome the limitations of atmospheric correction in coastal and inland waters involving absorbing aerosols, the use of multi-angle, multi-wavelength, polarized measurements to characterize aerosol and hydrosol properties would be beneficial. The polarized signal is measured by several multi-angular polarimeters like POLDER, the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP), the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), the Spectropolarimeter for Planetary EXploration (SPEX) and the HyperAngular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP). Notably, NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission plans to carry SPEXone and HARP2 as well as the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), which will acquire an abundance of unprecedented co-located datasets of polarimeter and ocean color measurements. To handle the huge volume of data it is critical to use a fast ocean reflectance model that can be used in the retrieval algorithms to achieve operational retrieval of aerosol and ocean color information. The retrieval algorithms need to call radiative transfer models iteratively in order to minimize the difference between measurements and model prediction, which is computationally expensive. In this chapter, available fast retrieval algorithms based on machine learning techniques used by the community are reviewed. Their scopes and limitations is discussed. Particularly this chapter summarizes various machine learning and optimization algorithms used in ocean optics studies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-87683-8_2,springer
Chapter ConferencePaper,doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2712-5_35,Deep Neural Networks to Predict Sub-surface Ocean Temperatures from Satellite-Derived Surface Ocean Parameters,Soft Computing for Problem Solving,10.1007/978-981-16-2712-5_35,Springer,2021-01-01,2021-10-14,"Sub-surface ocean temperature (SSOT) profiles are highly significant for tropical cyclone triggers and their progressive behavior; therefore, the prediction of these profiles is of utmost importance. Various past studies mention the successful use of soft computing methods in estimating SSOT profiles with good accuracy. However, the prediction of SSOT at significant lead times (3–5 days) has not been investigated yet. Whether recent advanced deep learning models can predict SSOT accurately at higher lead times, and if they do will the accuracy be competitive enough compared to past studies and sufficient to understand the progressing cyclone behavior? To answer these important issues, we propose a study using a combination of deep learning models to predict the SSOT profile (1.5–750 m) for the 3-day and 5-day lead times at a specific location in the eastern Indian Ocean. The proposed deep learning model is a combination of a convolutional long short-term memory two-dimensional (ConvLSTM 2D) network and a deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) fully connected network. ConvLSTM 2D is used for analyzing the spatio-temporal past sea surface temperature (SST) satellite-derived data around the study location. Deep MLP is used for analyzing past observed SSOT profiles at the study location. Two different experiments were performed for SSOT predictions, one is with only SST inputs (ConvLSTM 2D model) and the second is with a combination of SST and past SSOT profiles (combining ConvLSTM2D and deep MLP networks). A combination of SST and past SSOT profile experiments has shown highly accurate results compared to SST. Still, it is appreciable that SST alone can predict the SSOT up to a depth of 100 m with an accuracy of 0.5 °C (0.6 °C) at a 3-day (5-day) lead time. But for higher depths (100 m–300 m), the performance was drastically degraded and errors of magnitude more than 1.2 °C were observed. The second experiment of past SST and SSOT profiles as inputs has overcome this current limitation and errors for higher depths were observed to be below 1.0 °C. Moreover, it was very interesting to note that the second experiment has produced a very low error for lower depths (0–100 m) below 0.25 °C (0.4 °C) for a 3-day (5-day) lead time, which is the lowest compared to past SSOT estimation studies. Such highly accurate SSOT predictions from deep learning models at such higher lead times are very significant from a cyclone progression point of view, especially in upper layers.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2712-5_35,springer

This hypothesis is very useful for finding the answer to the question of what type of strategy is most applicable for the commercialization of digital products. It is shown that a generalized vision of three strategies (growth, cost reduction, and blue ocean) allows a comparative analysis of the possibility of strategizing digital solutions, which includes artificial intelligence.

The 2 past works are river flow forecasting in Bangladesh (a country with vast delta and severe floods perennially) and forecasting of maximum wave height and its time of arrival of the devastating Aceh tsunami in 2004. The on-going work is on deriving a cost effective and high accuracy Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from publicly accessible satellite data. The paper first demonstrates the ANN application on the river stage forecasting at Dhaka, Bangladesh, from 1 to 7 lead day forecast horizons. Although the input nodes used only the water levels at most upstream reaches of 3 main transboundary rivers (Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna), the goodness-of-fit R^2 values are very high ranging from 0.99 (for 1 lead day) to 0.91 (for 7 lead days). The reason, even without rainfall data in the input nodes, is that 80–95% of the catchments of these 3 large rivers lie in India; thus, the main flow contributions come from India. The high degree of accuracy, accompanied with very short computational time (less than 1 min), makes ANN a desirable advanced warning flow forecasting tool. The paper continues with a second ANN application demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency as a forecasting tool for devastating Indian Ocean/Aceh tsunami in 2004. The ANN was trained with simulation output data of a widely used process-based tsunami propagation model, TUNAMI-N2. The input nodes comprised, among others, the earthquake magnitude and epicenter with spatial values of maximum tsunami heights and tsunami arrival times (snapshots) for the most probable ocean floor rupture scenarios as its target. Validation tests demonstrated that with a given earthquake magnitude and location, the ANN method provides accurate and near instantaneous forecasting of the maximum tsunami heights and arrival times for the entire computational domain covering South China sea (the Philippines inclusive) and the Indian Ocean (India inclusive). The 3rd ANN application shows the on-going DEM improvement scheme, which significantly improves DEM originating from a publicly accessible satellite SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission). The scheme uses the DEM data of SRTM and the multispectral data of another publicly accessible satellite Sentinel-2 as the input to the ANN while the target is the high spatially resolution and high accuracy DEM from German Aerospace Center (DLR). Thus far the present improvement scheme manages to reduce the Root Mean Square Error up to 42.3%. Equally interesting is that the trained ANN can also be used to provide DEM in another part of the world with accuracy much higher than the raw DEM from SRTM.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-15-5436-0_42,springer

Voyage simulation is the most effective assessment tool to facilitate the discussion of the new operational limitations, and its model needs to be developed and validated for ocean-going ships in various cases. In this study, statistical validation of a voyage simulation model is attempted by comparison against numerous actual voyages collected from satellite automatic identification system data. The validation results showed that the simulated results of navigation in the North Pacific and North Atlantic are similar to those of actual voyages. Furthermore, to improve the reproducibility of the simulation in rough seas, a wave limit criterion was derived by comparing the probability density of the actually encountered and occurred wave heights of the navigable area.

Forecast quality have improved to a great extent however there are still constraints in computation time and cost for real-time operations. Soft computing techniques in the broad domain of computational intelligence are widely recognized today having diverse practical applications and beneficial value across multiple disciplines. The present study is an effort on application of soft computing techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithm, and Genetic Programming to predict storm surge and inundation characteristics resulting from tropical cyclones. The coast of Odisha adjoining the Bay of Bengal is considered for this case study. Historically, the Odisha coast is known to be highly vulnerable to strike from maximum number of high intense tropical cyclones that form over Bay of Bengal region. Recently in a separate study the authors have developed a comprehensive pre-computed dataset on storm surges and inundation scenarios from historical cyclones that made landfall over coastal Odisha State. Present study is an effort to effectively utilize the pre-computed dataset for real-time operation using soft computing techniques and that performs rapid computation to aid emergency preparedness and planning operations.

The well-preserved and continuous core samples comprising high resolution Cenozoic sediment records enable scientists to carry out paleoenvironment studies in detail. Bayesian age-depth chronological models constructed from biostratigraphic control points for the drilling sites are applied on cluster boundaries generated from two popular unsupervised learning methods: K -means and random forest. The unsupervised learning methods experimented have produced compact and unambiguous clusters from the datasets, indicating that previously unknown data patterns can be revealed when all variables from the datasets are taken into account simultaneously. A study of synchroneity of past events represented by the cluster boundaries across geographically separated ocean drilling sites is achieved through converting the fixed depths of cluster boundaries into chronological ranges represented by Gaussian density plots which are then compared with known past events in the region. A Gaussian density peak at around 7.2 Ma has been identified from results of all three sites and it is suggested to coincide with the initiation of the East Asian monsoon. Contrary to traditional statistical approach, a priori assumptions are not required for unsupervised learning, and the clustering results serve as a novel data-driven proxy for studying the complex and dynamic processes of the paleoenvironment surrounding the ocean sediment.

This mechanism is the horizontal expansion of the oil slick with inertia-gravity, gravity-viscosity, and viscous-surface tension. In the prediction of spreading, the surface of the slick can be considered as an ellipse where the major axis is in the direction of the wind. Ocean wave models, which account for the interaction between wind and waves, can be used to predict the state of the sea including wind direction in two dimensions where the wave spectrum is allowed to evolve freely with no constraints on the spectral shape. However, the wave model simulation for long duration is time-consuming. In this study, the technique of deep learning, a part of the machine learning method, is implemented to obtain a model used to get quick prediction of the wind direction. The technique uses outputs from an ocean wave model and applies the multivariate time series to obtain a linear relationship among multiple time series of wind prediction from the wave model. The wind forecast is taken as inputs to the deep learning model. Some of these inputs that are significant are selected by using the sigmoid function which is an activation function. The minimum error of prediction from the deep learning model is obtained by the gradient descent method.

The inexistence of tidal stations in the developing world is more evident than in other parts of the world. The lack of tidal height time-series data oftentimes forces modelers to interpolate or extrapolate these critical data, introducing important uncertainty bounds in the output of hydrodynamic models of estuaries. This paper assesses the feasibility of using gridded multi-mission sea surface height data for estimating tidal heights for the Columbia River estuary located in Northwestern USA. Ocean surface anomaly and geostrophic velocities gridded data, along with historical measured tidal heights are used for training and calibration of the ANN model. A nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural network is used to predict tidal heights at a 14-min time step.

Different from traditional data assimilation approaches, which provide prescribed initial/boundary conditions, our proposed algorithms aim to resolve a flow-dependent SST feedback between growing typhoons and oceans in the future time. Two of these algorithms are based on linear temperature equations (TE-based), and the other is based on an innovative technique involving machine learning (ML-based). The algorithms are then implemented into a Weather Research and Forecasting model for the simulation of typhoon to assess their effectiveness, and the results show significant improvement in simulated storm intensities by including ocean cooling feedback. The TE-based algorithm I considers wind-induced ocean vertical mixing and upwelling processes only, and thus obtained a synoptic and relatively smooth sea surface temperature cooling. The TE-based algorithm II incorporates not only typhoon winds but also ocean information, and thus resolves more cooling features. The ML-based algorithm is based on a neural network, consisting of multiple layers of input variables and neurons, and produces the best estimate of the cooling structure, in terms of its amplitude and position. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the typhoon-induced ocean cooling is a nonlinear process involving interactions of multiple atmospheric and oceanic variables. Therefore, with an appropriate selection of input variables and neuron sizes, the ML-based algorithm appears to be more efficient in prognosing the typhoon-induced ocean cooling and in predicting typhoon intensity than those algorithms based on linear regression methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10236-017-1082-z,springer

Results The difference in the current velocity estimated by the numerical model and actual observations at a given time was calculated and corresponding error time series was formed based on all past numerical estimations and observations. An ANN was trained over such time series to predict errors for future, which were added to the numerical estimation so as to predict daily current velocities over multiple days in future. Conclusions The suggested approach, implemented at two locations in Indian Ocean, was found to perform satisfactory current predictions up to a lead time of 5 days, as ascertained through various error statistics.

Such mixtures are complex, the number of species is huge and abundance information for many species is often sparse. Classical methods have a limited value for identifying complex features within such data. Results Here, we describe a novel hierarchical model for Bayesian inference of microbial communities (BioMiCo). The model takes abundance data derived from environmental DNA, and models the composition of each sample by a two-level hierarchy of mixture distributions constrained by Dirichlet priors. BioMiCo is supervised, using known features for samples and appropriate prior constraints to overcome the challenges posed by many variables, sparse data, and large numbers of rare species. The model is trained on a portion of the data, where it learns how assemblages of species are mixed to form communities and how assemblages are related to the known features of each sample. Training yields a model that can predict the features of new samples. We used BioMiCo to build models for three serially sampled datasets and tested their predictive accuracy across different time points. The first model was trained to predict both body site (hand, mouth, and gut) and individual human host. It was able to reliably distinguish these features across different time points. The second was trained on vaginal microbiomes to predict both the Nugent score and individual human host. We found that women having normal and elevated Nugent scores had distinct microbiome structures that persisted over time, with additional structure within women having elevated scores. The third was trained for the purpose of assessing seasonal transitions in a coastal bacterial community. Application of this model to a high-resolution time series permitted us to track the rate and time of community succession and accurately predict known ecosystem-level events. Conclusion BioMiCo provides a framework for learning the structure of microbial communities and for making predictions based on microbial assemblages. By training on carefully chosen features (abiotic or biotic), BioMiCo can be used to understand and predict transitions between complex communities composed of hundreds of microbial species.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40168-015-0073-x,springer

The wave exerts excess buoyancy force on the buoy, lifting it during the approach of wave crest while the gravity pulls it down during the wave trough. A hydraulic, direct or mechanical power takeoff is used to convert this up and down motion of the buoy to produce usable forms of energy. Though using a floating buoy for harnessing wave energy is conventional, this device faces many challenges in improving the overall conversion efficiency and survivability in extreme conditions. Up to the present, no studies have been done to harness ocean waves using a non-floating object and to find out the merits and demerits of the system. In the present paper, an innovative heaving body type of wave energy converter with a non-floating object was proposed to harness waves. It was also shown that the conversion efficiency and safety of the proposed device were significantly higher than any other device proposed with floating buoy. To demonstrate the improvements, experiments were conducted with non-floating body for different dimensions and the heave response was noted. Power generation was not considered in the experiment to observe the worst case response of the heaving body.

The estimate of H _ s from remotely sensed data acquired by non-coherent X-band marine radars is a problem not completely solved nowadays. A method commonly used in the literature (standard method) uses the square root of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to linearly estimate H _ s . This method has been widely used during the last decade, but it presents some limitations, especially when swell-dominated sea states are present. To overcome these limitations, a new non-linear method incorporating additional sea state information is proposed in this article. This method is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The information incorporated in the proposed MLP-based method is given by the wave monitoring system (WaMoS II) and concerns not only to the square root of the SNR, as in the standard method, but also to the peak wave length and mean wave period. Results for two different platforms (Ekofisk and FINO 1) placed in different locations of the North Sea are presented to analyze whether the proposed method works regardless of the sea states observed in each location or not. The obtained results empirically demonstrate how the proposed non-linear solution outperforms the standard method regardless of the environmental conditions (platform), maintaining real-time properties.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/1687-6180-2012-84,springer

Discharging the heated water with large quantities of mass flux generally requires multi-port diffusers. In recent years, using numerical models to predict the plume behavior has received attention from many researchers, who are interested in design of outfalls. This study reports the development and application of an artificial neural network model for prediction of initial dilution of multi-port tee diffusers. Several networks with different structures were trained and tested using error back propagation algorithm. Statistical error measures showed that a three layer network with 9 neurons in the hidden layer is skillful in prediction of initial dilution and the outputs are in good agreement (R = 0.97) with experimental results. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses showed that the width of the equivalent slot of the diffuser is the most important parameter in the estimation of initial dilution.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF03326114,springer

Investigation and analysis were performed for this region with two distinct datasets: (1) monthly climatological data for T and S fields (in 1° × 1° grid boxes) at standard depth levels of the World Ocean Atlas 1994 (WOA94), and; (2) heterogeneous randomly distributed in situ ARGO, ocean station data (OSD) and profiling (PFL) floats. A further numerical experiment was conducted with these two distinct datasets to train the neural network model. Nonlinear regression mapping utilizing a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to tackle nonlinearity in the data. This study reveals that a feed-forward type of network with a resilient backpropagation algorithm is best suited for deriving T and S fields; this is demonstrated by independently using WOA94 and in situ data, which thus tests the robustness of the ANN model. The suppleness of the T and S fields derived from the ANN model provides the freedom to generate a new grid at any desired level with a high degree of accuracy. Comprehensive training, testing and validation exercises were performed to demonstrate the robustness of the model and the consistency of the derived fields. The study points out that the parameters derived from the ANN model using scattered, inhomogeneous in situ data show very good agreement with state-of-the-art WOA climatological data. Using this approach, improvements in ocean climatology can be expected to occur in a synergistic manner with in situ observations. Our investigation of the Indian Ocean reveals that this approach can be extended to model global oceans.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00773-009-0081-2,springer

Densely populated cities on coastal belts are the engines of economic growth and the centers of innovation for global economy and hinterlands of respective nations. As we know most of global cities are located near the coast facilitating trade and commerce. They are also located near the mouths of major perennial rivers which serve as conduits for commerce connecting rest of the world. These locations place major cities at a greater risk of natural hazards viz., cyclones, flooding, sea-level rise, tsunamis, etc. With the increasing intensity of economic exploitation in coastal belts, there is also an increase in socio-economic consequences resulting from the hazardous action of tsunami waves generated from submarine seismic activity and other causes. On 26 December 2004, the countries within the vicinity of East Indian Ocean experienced and witnessed the most devastating tsunami in recorded history. This tsunami was triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 on the Richter scale at 3.4° N, 95.7° E off the coast of Sumatra in the Indonesian Archipelago at 06:29 hrs IST (00:59 hrs GMT).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-2498-5_6,springer

The failure of offshore structures can cause sea pollution as well as loss of property and life. Therefore, the safety of such structures is an important issue. The reduction of the dynamic response of an offshore structure subjected to wind-generated random ocean waves is another critical problem with regard to the serviceability, fatigue life, and safety of the structure. In this article, the responses of offshore structures under random ocean waves are controlled using a modified probabilistic neural network (MPNN). As a more advanced method, it uses the global probability density function (PDF) produced by summing the heterogeneous local PDFs automatically determined from the individual standard deviation of each variable. The state vectors in a state-space model of a structure and the resulting control forces made by a linear quadratic regulator algorithm were used to generate the training patterns for the MPNN and a conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results were compared with those produced by back-propagation based on the MLP. The proposed MPNN method shows good results not only in controlling the responses but also in terms of the computation time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00773-008-0040-3,springer

The data covers a range of variability in Chl in surface waters from 0.3 to 6.5 mg m^-3. The comparison results showed that these empirical algorithms developed for case I and case II waters can not be applied directly to the Bohai Sea of China, because of significant biases.

It is based on a neural network (NN) algorithm, which is used for the rapid inversion of a radiative transfer procedure with the goal of retrieving not only the concentrations of chlorophyll a but also the two other components that determine the water-leaving radiance spectrum. The NN algorithm was tested using the NASA's SeaBAM (SeaWiFS Bio-Optical Mini-Workshop) test data set and applied to ADEOS/OCTS data of the Northwest Pacific in the region off Sanriku, Japan. The root-mean-square error between chlorophyll a concentrations derived from the SeaBAM reflectance data and the chlorophyll a measurements is 0.62. The retrieved chlorophyll a concentrations of the OCTS data were compared with the corresponding distribution obtained by the standard OCTS algorithm. The concentrations and distribution patterns from both algorithms match for open ocean areas. Since there are no standard OCTS products available for yellow substance and suspended matter and no in situ measurements available for validation, the result of the retrieval by the NN for these two variables could only be assessed by a general knowledge of their concentrations and distribution patterns.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/B:JOCE.0000038345.99050.c0,springer

Upper ocean heat content (HC) from a 6-layer ocean model was a better predictor of the wind stress than the (observed or modelled) sea surface temperature (SST). Our results showed that the NN model generally had slightly better skills in predicting the contemporaneous wind stress than the linear regression (LR) model in the off-equatorial tropical Pacific and in the eastern equatorial Pacific. When the wind stresses from the NN and LR models were used to drive the ocean model, slightly better SST skills were found in the off-equatorial tropical Pacific and in the eastern equatorial Pacific when the NN winds were used instead of the LR winds. Better skills for the model HC were found in the western and central equatorial Pacific when the NN winds were used instead of the LR winds. Why NN failed to show more significant improvement over LR in the equatorial Pacific for the wind stress and SST is probably because the relationship between the surface ocean and the atmosphere in the equatorial Pacific over the seasonal time scale is almost linear.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s003820000119,springer

Over the time of its operation, the sensor captured the coverage of global oceans suitable for studies of the marine primary production and monitoring of fishery sites and environmental changes. Current radiative transfer techniques modelling marine chlorophyll levels based on optical reflectances captured by satellite sensors have to account for atmospheric path radiances superimposed onto the waterleaving radiance and a diversity of water suspended particles. Detailed modelling of geophysical processes and empirically constrained algorithms sometimes produce misclassifications. This paper presents chlorophyll concentration for several sites around the Pacific Ocean. Where the skill of the conventional chlorophyll algorithm is uncertain, the results given by an unsupervised neural network classification scheme are also provided.
