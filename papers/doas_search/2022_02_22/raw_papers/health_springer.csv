In this context, the application of AI algorithms in endoscopy is gaining increasing attention so that modern endoscopy is moving towards more and more assisted/automatic solutions. Several approaches have been carried out in order to improve accuracy in diagnosis and surgical procedures. In this chapter, a general overview of the main contributions in the field is surveyed. Four main categories of applications were identified, namely, (i) detection and diagnosis during endoscopic procedure, (ii) informative frame selection, (iii) mosaicking and surface reconstruction, (iv) augmented reality systems for intraoperative assistance and surgeon training. Discussions on future research directions and implementation in clinical practice are provided.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-64573-1_164,springer,1
Chapter,doi:10.1007/978-3-030-80928-7_10,AiIoMT: IoMT-Based System-Enabled Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Smart Healthcare Systems,Machine Learning for Critical Internet of Medical Things,10.1007/978-3-030-80928-7_10,Springer,2022-01-01,2022-01-01,"The healthcare system has been on the frontline in recent years, researchers have tried to find solutions to different illnesses and sickness by applying various modern methods. But the major difference among them is that in recent years, other powerful new tools have emerged, which could be used as an instrument in the healthcare system and keeping it within reasonable limits. One of those technological tools is the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, AI enabled with IoMT-based systems is causing a paradigm shift in the healthcare zone, and the applicability might yield profit especially in diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of different diseases outbreak. The application of AI enabled with IoT-based systems in the healthcare system can be expediting the diagnoses and monitoring of disease and minimizes the burden of medical processes. Therefore, this chapter reviews the applicability of AiIoMT-based system in healthcare systems and the research challenges in deployment of AiIoMT system. The chapter also proposed an AiIoMT-based framework for diagnosis and monitoring of patients in real time. The model was tested using cytology image dataset and evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and precision. The findings show a greater diagnosis accuracy of 99.5%, which shows that the AI model is a promising algorithm for the diagnosis of diseases in an IoMT-based system. The diagnosis, prediction, treatment, screening, and medication in the healthcare system have significantly improved with the continuing expansion in the methods having seriously reduced human intervention in medical practice.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-80928-7_10,springer,2
