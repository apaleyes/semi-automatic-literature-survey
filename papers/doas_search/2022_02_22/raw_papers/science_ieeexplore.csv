10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3147955,How to Boost the Performance of Recommender Systems by Social Trust? Studying the Challenges and Proposing a Solution,IEEE,Journals,"With the increasing number of items in electronic retailers, news websites, etc., finding interesting items concerning the taste of users is becoming more challenging. Recommender Systems (RS) are a well-known solution to this issue. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely accepted and popular technique to implement an RS. However, cold-start and data sparsity problems reduce the performance of CF methods. One promising solution for these issues is to use the social trust information. However, how to properly use social trust information is a hot and still open question. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure and a simple link prediction method to address this question and employ them in trust-aware matrix factorization. Especially, our proposed similarity measure is asymmetric to consider the nature of social relationships. Also, to have a more accurate similarity estimation, we have considered both the user’s historical ratings and trust relations, and we have determined the weight of each source. Finally, we have used the item-based model and the level of interest a user’s trustee have for an item to improve the performance of the proposed method for sparse datasets. We conduct extensive performance evaluations in terms of rate prediction and interesting items found. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in terms of Mean Absolute Error.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9698036/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/CCNC49033.2022.9700613,First Experimental Results on Real-Time Cleaning Activity Monitoring System,IEEE,Conferences,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented social challenges to establish the new normal lifestyle in our daily lives. The goal of this paper is to enable easy and low-cost monitoring of cleaning activity to keep a clean environment for preventing infection. Although human activity recognition has been a hot research topic in pervasive computing, existing schemes have not been optimized for monitoring cleaning activities. To address this issue, this paper provides an initial concept and preliminary experimental results of cleaning activity recognition using accelerometer data and RFID tags. In the proposed scheme, machine learning technologies and short range wireless communication are employed for recognizing the time and place of wiping as an example of cleaning activities, because it is an important activity for shared places to avoid infection. This paper reports the evaluation results on the recognition accuracy using the proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation to clarify the required sampling rate and time-window size for further experiments. Also, a real-time feedback system is implemented to provide the monitoring results for users. The proposed scheme contributes for efficient monitoring of cleaning activities for creating the new normal era.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9700613/,2022 IEEE 19th Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC),8-11 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/WACV51458.2022.00391,Unveiling Real-Life Effects of Online Photo Sharing,IEEE,Conferences,"Social networks give free access to their services in exchange for the right to exploit their users’ data. Data sharing is done in an initial context which is chosen by the users. However, data are used by social networks and third parties in different contexts which are often not transparent. In order to unveil such usages, we propose an approach which focuses on the effects of data sharing in impactful real-life situations. Focus is put on visual content because of its strong influence in shaping online user profiles. The approach relies on three components: (1) a set of visual objects with associated situation impact ratings obtained by crowdsourcing, (2) a corresponding set of object detectors for mining users’ photos and (3) a ground truth dataset made of 500 visual user profiles which are manually rated per situation. These components are combined in LERV UP, a method which learns to rate visual user profiles in each situation. LERV UP exploits a new image descriptor which aggregates object ratings and object detections at user level and an attention mechanism which boosts highly-rated objects to prevent them from being overwhelmed by low-rated ones. Performance is evaluated per situation by measuring the correlation between the automatic ranking of profile ratings and a manual ground truth. Results indicate that LERV UP is effective since a strong correlation of the two rankings is obtained. A practical implementation of the approach in a mobile app which raises user awareness about shared data usage is also discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9706741/,2022 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV),3-8 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3147519,A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Inappropriate Content Detection and Classification of YouTube Videos,IEEE,Journals,"The exponential growth of videos on YouTube has attracted billions of viewers among which the majority belongs to a young demographic. Malicious uploaders also find this platform as an opportunity to spread upsetting visual content, such as using animated cartoon videos to share inappropriate content with children. Therefore, an automatic real-time video content filtering mechanism is highly suggested to be integrated into social media platforms. In this study, a novel deep learning-based architecture is proposed for the detection and classification of inappropriate content in videos. For this, the proposed framework employs an ImageNet pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model known as EfficientNet-B7 to extract video descriptors, which are then fed to bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to learn effective video representations and perform multiclass video classification. An attention mechanism is also integrated after BiLSTM to apply attention probability distribution in the network. These models are evaluated on a manually annotated dataset of 111,156 cartoon clips collected from YouTube videos. Experimental results demonstrated that EfficientNet-BiLSTM (accuracy = 95.66%) performs better than attention mechanism-based EfficientNet-BiLSTM (accuracy = 95.30%) framework. Secondly, the traditional machine learning classifiers perform relatively poor than deep learning classifiers. Overall, the architecture of EfficientNet and BiLSTM with 128 hidden units yielded state-of-the-art performance (f1 score = 0.9267). Furthermore, the performance comparison against existing state-of-the-art approaches verified that BiLSTM on top of CNN captures better contextual information of video descriptors in network architecture, and hence achieved better results in child inappropriate video content detection and classification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9696242/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137636,A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Phishing Website Detection,IEEE,Journals,"Phishing attackers spread phishing links through e-mail, text messages, and social media platforms. They use social engineering skills to trick users into visiting phishing websites and entering crucial personal information. In the end, the stolen personal information is used to defraud the trust of regular websites or financial institutions to obtain illegal benefits. With the development and applications of machine learning technology, many machine learning-based solutions for detecting phishing have been proposed. Some solutions are based on the features extracted by rules, and some of the features need to rely on third-party services, which will cause instability and time-consuming issues in the prediction service. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for detecting phishing websites. We have implemented the framework as a browser plug-in capable of determining whether there is a phishing risk in real-time when the user visits a web page and gives a warning message. The real-time prediction service combines multiple strategies to improve accuracy, reduce false alarm rates, and reduce calculation time, including whitelist filtering, blacklist interception, and machine learning (ML) prediction. In the ML prediction module, we compared multiple machine learning models using several datasets. From the experimental results, the RNN-GRU model obtained the highest accuracy of 99.18%, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9661323/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140175,"A Metaverse: Taxonomy, Components, Applications, and Open Challenges",IEEE,Journals,"Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different. With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9667507/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore

10.1109/TC.2021.3057082,<sc>Lime</sc>: Low-Cost and Incremental Learning for Dynamic Heterogeneous Information Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Understanding the interconnected relationships of large-scale information networks like social, scholar and Internet of Things networks is vital for tasks like recommendation and fraud detection. The vast majority of the real-world networks are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic, containing many different types of nodes and edges and can change drastically over time. The dynamicity and heterogeneity make it extremely challenging to reason about the network structure. Unfortunately, existing approaches are inadequate in modeling real-life dynamical networks as they either have strong assumption of a given stochastic process or fail to capture the heterogeneity of network structure, and they all require extensive computational resources. We introduce <sc>Lime</sc>, a better approach for modeling dynamic and heterogeneous information networks. <sc>Lime</sc> is designed to extract high-quality network representation with significantly lower memory resources and computational time over the state-of-the-arts. Unlike prior work that uses a vector to encode each network node, we exploit the semantic relationships among network nodes to encode multiple nodes with similar semantics in shared vectors. By using many fewer node vectors, our approach significantly reduces the required memory space for encoding large-scale networks. To effectively trade information sharing for reduced memory footprint, we employ the recursive neural network (RsNN) with carefully designed optimization strategies to explore the node semantics in a novel cuboid space. We then go further by showing, for the first time, how an effective incremental learning approach can be developed – with the help of RsNN, our cuboid structure, and a set of novel optimization techniques – to allow a learning framework to quickly and efficiently adapt to a constantly evolving network. We evaluate <sc>Lime</sc> by applying it to three representative network-based tasks, node classification, node clustering and anomaly detection, performing on three large-scale datasets. We compare <sc>Lime</sc> against eleven prior state-of-the-art approaches for learning network representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that <sc>Lime</sc> not only reduces the memory footprint by over 80 percent and the processing time over 2x when learning network representation but also delivers comparable performance for downstream processing tasks. We show that our incremental learning method can boost the learning time by up to 20x without compromising the quality of the learned network representation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9353275/,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1 March 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIFS.2021.3131026,Poligraph: Intrusion-Tolerant and Distributed Fake News Detection System,IEEE,Journals,"We present Poligraph, an intrusion-tolerant and decentralized fake news detection system. Poligraph aims to address architectural, system, technical, and social challenges of building a practical, long-term fake news detection platform. We first conduct a case study for fake news detection at authors’ institute, showing that machine learning-based reviews are less accurate but timely, while human reviews, in particular, experts reviews, are more accurate but time-consuming. This justifies the need for combining both approaches. At the core of Poligraph is two-layer consensus allowing seamlessly combining machine learning techniques and human expert determination. We construct the two-layer consensus using Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) and asynchronous threshold common coin protocols. We prove the correctness of our system in terms of conventional definitions of security in distributed systems (agreement, total order, and liveness) as well as new review validity (capturing the accuracy of news reviews). We also provide theoretical foundations on parameter selection for our system. We implement Poligraph and evaluate its performance on Amazon EC2 using a variety of news from online publications and social media. We demonstrate Poligraph achieves throughput of more than 5,000 transactions per second and latency as low as 0.05 second. The throughput of Poligraph is only marginally (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${4\%}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>–<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${7\%}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) slower than that of an unreplicated, single-server implementation.

10.1109/TII.2021.3117861,Toward Fairness-Aware Time-Sensitive Asynchronous Federated Learning for Critical Energy Infrastructure,IEEE,Journals,"Critical energy infrastructure (CEI) systems are vital to underpin the national economy and social development, but vulnerable to cyber attack and data privacy leakage when distributed machine learning technologies are deployed on them. Although federated learning (FL) has promoted distributed collaborative learning while keeping natural compliance with the privacy protection, it is tremendously difficult to schedule edge nodes of CEI collaboratively when asynchronous FL tasks are applied in CEI system, since the CEI system must make an irrevocable immediate decision on whether to hire a participant who arrives and departs dynamically without knowing future information. In this article, we tackle this issue by designing fairness-aware and time-sensitive task allocation mechanisms in asynchronous FL for CEI. First, we design an optimal multidimensional contract to guarantee the reliability, honesty, and fairness, and maximize the learning accuracy for the fixed deadline scenario. Second, we design a multimetric participant recruitment mechanism to control time consumption for the limited budget scenario, prove that the problem of optimizing this mechanism is NP-hard, and propose an <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$e$</tex-math></inline-formula>-approximation algorithm accordingly. Finally, extensive experiments using both real-world data and simulated data further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560090/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,May 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/TGRS.2021.3087186,3-D Gabor Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Due to the detailed spectral information through hundreds of narrow spectral bands provided by hyperspectral image (HSI) data, it can be employed to accurately classify diverse materials of interest, which is one of the core applications of hyperspectral remote sensing technology. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied in many fields, including HSI classification. However, the random gradient descent-based parameter updating scheme is too general and leading to the inefficiency of CNN models. Moreover, the high dimensionality and limited training samples of HSI data also exacerbate the overfitting problem. To tackle these issues, in this article, a novel deep network with multilayer and multibranch architecture, named 3-D Gabor CNN (3DG-CNN), is proposed for HSI classification. More precisely, since the predefined 3-D Gabor filters in multiple scales and orientations could well characterize the internal spatial–spectral structure of HSI data from various perspectives, the 3-D Gabor-modulated kernels (3-D GMKs) are employed to replace the random initialization kernels. Moreover, the specially designed multibranch architecture enables the network to better integrating the scalable property of 3-D Gabor filters; thus, the representative ability and robustness of the extracted features can be greatly improved. Alternatively, the number of network parameters is substantially reduced due to the incorporation of 3-D Gabor modulation, relieving the training complexity and also alleviating the training process from overfitting. Experimental results on four real HSI datasets (including two newly released ones in the literature) have demonstrated that the proposed 3DG-CNN model can achieve better performance than several widely used machine-learning-based and deep-learning-based approaches. For the sake of reproducibility, the codes of the proposed 3DG-CNN model are available at <uri>http://jiasen.tech/papers/</uri>.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9460777/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/TCBB.2021.3082915,GraphPlas: Refined Classification of Plasmid Sequences Using Assembly Graphs,IEEE,Journals,"Plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic materials with important markers that affect the function and behaviour of the microorganisms supporting their environmental adaptations. Hence the identification and recovery of such plasmid sequences from assemblies is a crucial task in metagenomics analysis. In the past, machine learning approaches have been developed to separate chromosomes and plasmids. However, there is always a compromise between precision and recall in the existing classification approaches. The similarity of compositions between chromosomes and their plasmids makes it difficult to separate plasmids and chromosomes with high accuracy. However, high confidence classifications are accurate with a significant compromise of recall, and vice versa. Hence, the requirement exists to have more sophisticated approaches to separate plasmids and chromosomes accurately while retaining an acceptable trade-off between precision and recall. We present GraphPlas, a novel approach for plasmid recovery using coverage, composition and assembly graph topology. We evaluated GraphPlas on simulated and real short read assemblies with varying compositions of plasmids and chromosomes. Our experiments show that GraphPlas is able to significantly improve accuracy in detecting plasmid and chromosomal contigs on top of popular state-of-the-art plasmid detection tools. <p>The source code is freely available at: <uri>https://github.com/anuradhawick/GraphPlas</uri>.</p>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9439922/,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,1 Jan.-Feb. 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/LRA.2022.3140793,Vision-Based Self-Adaptive Gripping in a Trimodal Robotic Sorting End-Effector,IEEE,Journals,"Recyclable waste management, which includes sorting as a key process, is a crucial component of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. The use of robots in sorting could significantly facilitate the production of secondary raw materials from waste in the sense of a recycling economy. However, due to the complex and heterogeneous types of the recyclable items, the conventional robotic gripping end-effectors, which typically come with a fixed structure, are unlikely to hold onto the full range of items to enable separation and recycling. To this end, a trimodal adaptive end-effector is proposed that can be integrated with robotic manipulators to improve their gripping versatility. The end-effector can deploy effective modes of gripping to different objects in response to their size and porosity via gripping mechanisms based on Nano Polyurethane (PU) adhesive gels, pumpless vacuum suction, and radially deployable claws. While the end-effector's mechanical design allows the three gripping modes to be deployed independently or in conjunction with one another, this work aims at deploying modes that are effective for gripping onto the recyclable item. In order to decide on the suitable modes of gripping a real-time vision system is designed to measure the size and porosity of the recyclable items and advise on a suitable combination of gripping modes to be deployed. Integrated current sensors provide an indication of successful gripping and releasing of the recyclable items. The results of the experiments confirmed the ability of our vision-based approach in identifying suitable gripping modes in real-time, the deployment of the relevant mechanisms and successful gripping onto a maximum of 84.8% (single-mode), 90.9% (dual-mode) and 96.9% (triple-mode) of a specified set of recyclable items.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9672720/,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,April 2022,ieeexplore
