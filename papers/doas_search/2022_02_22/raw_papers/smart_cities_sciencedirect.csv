In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation. Additionally, we identify a set of challenges and future directions based on the existing literature and the analysis of our evaluation results.",smart cities

Despite a well-constrained global budget, quantification of local and regional methane emissions has proven challenging. Recent advancements in airborne remote sensing instruments such as from the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) provide 2-D observations of CH4 plume column enhancements at an unprecedented resolution of 1–5 m over large geographic areas. Quantifying an emission rate from observed plumes is a critical step for understanding local emission distributions and prioritizing mitigation efforts. However, there exists no method that can predict emission rates from detected plumes in real-time without ancillary data reliably. In order to predict methane point-source emissions directly from high resolution 2-D plume images without relying on other local measurements such as background wind speeds, we trained a convolutional neural network model called MethaNet. The training data was derived from large eddy simulations of methane plumes and realistic measurement noise over agricultural, desert and urban environments. Our model has a mean absolute percentage error for predicting unseen plumes under 17%, a significant improvement from previous methods that require wind information. Using MethaNet, a validation against a natural gas controlled-release experiment agrees to within the precision error estimate. Our results support the basis for the applicability of using deep learning techniques to quantify CH4 point sources in an automated manner over large geographical areas, not only for present and future airborne field campaigns but also for upcoming space-based observations in this decade.",smart cities

The framework can generate realistic simulations of desired locations entailing the terrain, elevation model, infrastructures, dynamic visualizations (e.g. water and fire simulation), and information layers (e.g. disaster damages and extent, sensor readings, occupancy, traffic, weather). These layers enable in-situ visualization of useful data to aid public, scientists, officials, and decision-makers in acquiring a bird's eye view of the current, historical, or forecasted condition of a community.

In this paper, an advanced system-level EMS is proposed for residential AC/DC microgrids (MGs) by taking advantage of the innovations offered by digitalization.

In addition, the electricity consumption behaviors of residential users have been automatically extracted to create a more flexible MG. Deep learning-supported Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithm is deployed to analyze and disaggregate the aggregated consumption signal of each household in the MG.

As the interest in AV deployment increases, there is an increasing need to assess and understand the expected implications of AVs on traffic safety. Until recently, most of the literature has been based on either survey questionnaires, simulation analysis, virtual reality, or simulation to assess the safety benefits of AVs. Although few studies have used AV crash data, vulnerable road users (VRUs) have not been a topic of interest. Therefore, this study uses crash narratives from four-year (2017–2020) of AV crash data collected from California to explore the direct and indirect involvement of VRUs. The study applied text network and compared the text classification performance of four classifiers - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NN) and associated performance metrics to attain the objective. It was found that out of 252 crashes, VRUs were, directly and indirectly, involved in 23 and 12 crashes, respectively. Among VRUs, bicyclists and scooterists are more likely to be involved in the AV crashes directly, and bicyclists are likely to be at fault, while pedestrians appear more in the indirectly involvements. Further, crashes that involve VRUs indirectly are likely to occur when the AVs are in autonomous mode and are slightly involved minor damages on the rear bumper than the ones that directly involve VRUs. Additionally, feature importance from the best performing classifiers (RF and NN) revealed that crosswalks, intersections, traffic signals, movements of AVs (turning, slowing down, stopping) are the key predictors of the VRUs-AV related crashes. These findings can be helpful to AV operators and city planners.",smart cities

However, a lack of practical guidance and a limited understanding of sensor data quality hinder the widespread application of this emerging technology. We leveraged air quality data collected from state and local monitoring agencies in metropolitan areas of the United States to evaluate how low-cost sensors could be deployed across the U.S. We found that ozone, as a secondary pollutant, is more homogeneous than other pollutants at various scales. PM2.5, CO, and NO2 displayed homogeneities that varied by city, making it challenging to design a uniform network that was suitable across geographies. Our low-cost sensor data in New York City indicated that PM2.5 sensors track well with light-scattering reference methods, particularly at low concentrations. The same phenomenon was also found after thoroughly evaluating sensor evaluation reports from the Air Quality Sensor Performance Evaluation Center (AQ-SPEC). Furthermore, LCAQS data collected during wildfire episodes in Portland, OR show that a real-time (i.e. in situ) machine learning calibration process is a promising approach to address the data quality challenges persisting in LCAQS applications.

Determining them by their respective reference methods, however, is laborious, expensive, and time consuming. To overcome this, we developed a new analytical instrument called Solids in Wastewater's Machine Vision-based Automatic Analyzer (SWAMVA), which is equiped with an automatic sampler and a software for real-time digital movie capture to quantify sequentially the TSS and SetS contents in wastewater samples. The machine vision algorithm (MVA) coupled with the Red color plane (derived from color histograms in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) system) showed the best prediction results with R2 of 0.988 and 0.964, and relative error of prediction (REP) of 6.133 and 9.115% for TSS and SetS, respectively. The constructed models were validated by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the accuracy and precision of the predictions by the t- and F-tests, respectively, at a 0.05 significance level. The elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) test confirmed the accuracy, while the coefficient of variation (CV) of 6.529 and 10.908% confirmed the good precisions, respectively. Compared with the reference method (Standard Methods For the Examination of Water and Wastewater), the proposed method reduced the analysis volume from 1.5 L to just 15 mL and the analysis time from 12 h to 24 s per sample. Therefore, SWAMVA can be considered an important alternative to the determination of TSS and SetS in wastewater as an automatic, fast, and low-cost analytical tool, following the principles of Green Chemistry and exploiting Industry 4.0 features such as intelligent processing, miniaturization, and machine vision.",smart cities

There is less reliance on explicit driver- or vehicle-based messages, such as hand/head movements, or flashing lights/beeping horns. With the impending deployment of Automated Vehicles (AV), especially those at SAE Level 4 and 5, where the driver is no longer in control of the vehicle, there has been a surge in interest in the value of new forms of communication for AVs, for example, via different types of external Human Machine Interfaces (eHMIs). However, there is still much to be understood about how quickly a novel eHMI affects pedestrian crossing decisions, and whether it provides any additional aid, above and beyond implicit/kinematic information from the vehicle. The aim of this between-participant study, funded by the H2020 interACT project, was to investigate how the combination of kinematic information from a vehicle (e.g., Speed and Deceleration), and eHMI designs, play a role in assisting the crossing decision of pedestrians in a cave-based pedestrian simulator. Method: Using an existing, well-recognized, message for yielding (Flashing Headlights - FH) as a benchmark, this study also investigated how quickly a novel eHMI (Slow Pulsing Light Band – SPLB) was learned. To investigate the effect of eHMI visibility on crossing decisions, the distance at which each eHMI was perceivable was also measured. Results: Results showed that, compared to SPLB, the FH led to earlier crossings during vehicle deceleration, especially at lower approaching speeds, and smaller time gaps. However, although FH was visible earlier than SPLB, this visibility does not appear to be the only reason for earlier crossings, with message familiarity thought to play a role. Participants were found to learn the meaning conveyed by FH relatively quickly, crossing around 1 second earlier in its presence (compared to the no eHMI condition), across the three blocks of trials. On the other hand, it took participants at least one block of 12 trials for the new SPLB signal to affect crossing, which only accelerated crossing initiations by around 200 ms, compared to the no eHMI condition. The role of comprehension, long-term exposure, and familiarity of novel messages in this context is therefore important, if AVs are to provide safe, trustworthy communication messages, which will enhance traffic flow and efficiency.",smart cities

A Turing approach and an application to SAE automation Level 2 cars,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120490088,"Fully automated vehicles (AVs) are set to become a reality in future decades and changes are to be expected in user perceptions and behavior. While AV acceptability has been widely studied, changes in human drivers’ behavior and in passengers’ reactions have received less attention. It is not yet possible to ascertain the risk of driver behavioral changes such as overreaction, and the corresponding safety problems, in mixed traffic with partially AVs. Nor has there been proper investigation of the potential unease of car occupants trained for human control, when exposed to automatic maneuvers. The conjecture proposed in this paper is that automation Level 2 vehicles do not induce potentially adverse effects in traditional vehicle drivers’ behavior or in occupants’ reactions, provided that they are indistinguishable from human-driven vehicles. To this end, the paper proposes a Turing approach to test the “humanity” of automation Level 2 vehicles. The proposed test was applied to the results of an experimental campaign carried out in Italy: 546 car passengers were interviewed on board Level 2 cars in which they could not see the driver. They were asked whether a specific driving action (braking, accelerating, lane keeping) had been performed by the human driver or by the automatic on-board software under different traffic conditions (congestion and speed). Estimation results show that in most cases the interviewees were unable to distinguish the Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the human driver by observing random responses with a 95% significance level (proportion of success statistically equal to 50%). However, in the case of moderate braking and lane keeping at >100 km/h and in high traffic congestion, respondents recognized AI control from the human driver above pure chance, with 62–69% correct response rates. These findings, if confirmed in other case studies, could significantly impact on AVs acceptability, also contributing to their design as well as to long-debated ethical questions. AI driving software could be designed and tested for “humanity”, as long as safety is guaranteed, and autonomous cars could be allowed to circulate as long as they cannot be distinguished from human-driven vehicles in recurrent driving conditions.",smart cities

Previous works mainly focus on binary change detection (BCD) based on modern technologies, e.g., deep fully convolutional network (FCN), whereas the deep network architecture for semantic change detection (SCD) is insufficiently explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task encoder-transformer-decoder architecture (ChangeMask) designed by exploring two important inductive biases: sematic-change causal relationship and temporal symmetry. ChangeMask decouples the SCD into a temporal-wise semantic segmentation and a BCD, and then integrates these two tasks into a general encoder-transformer-decoder framework. In the encoder part, we design a semantic-aware encoder to model the semantic-change causal relationship. This encoder is only used to learn semantic representation and then learn change representation from semantic representation via a later transformer module. In this way, change representation can constrain semantic representation during training, which introduces a regularization to reduce the risk of overfitting. To learn a robust change representation from semantic representation, we propose a temporal-symmetric transformer (TST) to guarantee temporal symmetry for change representation and keep it discriminative. Based on the above semantic representation and change representation, we adopt simple multi-task decoders to output semantic change map. Benefiting from the differentiable building blocks, ChangeMask can be trained by a multi-task loss function, which significantly simplifies the whole pipeline of applying ChangeMask. The comprehensive experimental results on two large-scale SCD datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ChangeMask in SCD. Besides, to demonstrate the potential value in real-world applications, e.g., automatic urban analysis and decision-making, we deploy the ChangeMask to map a large geographic area covering 30 km2 with 300 million pixels.

These include hybrid electrically driven railway vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries. The cost of hydrogen consumption and the lifetime of fuel cells are currently the main challenges that need to be addressed before widespread deployment of fuel cell railway vehicles can be realized. With this in mind, this work focuses on the energy management system with emphasis on optimizing the energy distribution to reduce the overall operational cost. The presented energy management strategy (EMS) aims at minimizing hydrogen consumption and fuel cell aging costs while achieving a favorable balance between battery charging and discharging. In order to take fuel cell aging into account in energy management and mitigate fuel cell aging trough power distribution, an online fuel cell aging estimation model based on four operation modes is introduced and applied. Moreover, the advanced deep reinforcement learning method Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) is used to obtain a promising EMS. To improve the adaptability of the strategy, a stochastic training environment, which is based on real measured speed profiles considering passenger numbers is used for training. Assuming different environmental and passenger transport volumes, the results confirm that the proposed TD3-EMS achieves battery charge-sustaining at low hydrogen consumption while slowing down fuel cell degradation.",smart cities

In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns.

By introducing a concept of control utility that evaluates vehicle energy efficiency with a penalty on usage of battery energy, experimental evaluations based on the hardware-in-the-loop testing platform are conducted.
