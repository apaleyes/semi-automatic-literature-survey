People consume more and the products are designed to have shorter lifespans. Recycling is the only way to make a sustainable environment. The process of recycling requires the separation of waste materials, which is a time consuming procedure. However, most of the proposed research works found in literature are neither budget-friendly nor effective to be practical in real world applications. In this paper, we propose a solution: a low-cost and effective Smart Recycling Bin that utilizes the power of cloud to assist with waste classification. A centralized Information System (IS) collects measurements from smart bins that are deployed all around the city and classifies the waste of each bin using Artificial Intelligence and neural networks. Our implementation is capable of classifying different types of waste with an accuracy of 93.4% while keeping deployment cost and power consumption very low."

Transforming such intentions and interests to reality involves software development and deployment, which has its own story of significant evolution. There has been a notable shift in the strategies and approaches to software development. Today, the divergence of tools and technologies as per demand is so substantial that adapting a software application from one environment to another could involve tedious redesign and redevelopment. This implies enormous effort in migrating existing applications and research works to a modern industrial setup. Additionally, the struggles with sustainability maintenance of such applications could be painful. Concerning ML/AI, the capabilities to train, deploy, retrain, and re-deploy AI models as quickly as possible will be crucial for AI-driven network systems. An end-to-end workflow using unified open-source frameworks is the need of the hour to facilitate the integration of ML/AI models into the modern software-driven virtualized communication networks. Hence, in our paper, we present such a prototype by demonstrating the journey of a sample SVM classifier from being a python script to be deployed as a micro-service using ONAP and Acumos. While illustrating various features of Acumos and ONAP, this paper intends to make readers familiar with an end-to-end workflow taking advantage of the integration of both open-source platforms."

There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement."

However, the Internet can only provide no guaranteed delivery. The high dynamic of the available bandwidth may cause bitrate switching or video rebuffering, thus inevitably damaging the QoE. Besides, the frequently requested popular videos are transmitted for multiple times and contribute to most of the bandwidth consumption, which causes massive transmission redundancy. Therefore, we propose a Learning-based Edge with cAching and Prefetching (LEAP) to improve the online user QoE of adaptive video streaming. LEAP introduces caching into the edge to reduce the redundant video transmission and employs prefetching to fight against network jitters. Taking the state information of users into account, LEAP intelligently makes the most beneficial decisions of caching and prefetching by a QoE-oriented deep neural network model. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we deploy the implemented prototype of LEAP in both the simulated scenario and the real Internet. Compared with all selected schemes, LEAP at least raises average bitrate by 34.4&#x0025; and reduces video rebuffering by 42.7&#x0025;, which leads to at least 15.9&#x0025; improvement in the user QoE in the simulated scenario. The results in the real Internet scenario further confirm the superiority of LEAP."

This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production.

However, this poses a major challenge for cloud IaaS providers who cannot control the software programs that users develop, install or download on their rented VMs. Those programs may not be well developed with various bugs or even downloaded/installed together with virus, which often make damages to the VMs or infect the cloud platform. To keep the health of a cloud IaaS platform, it is very important to implement the PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technology for detecting those software problems and self-healing them in an intelligent and timely way. This paper realized a novel PHM technology inspired by biological autonomic nervous system to deal with the memory anomalies of those programs running on the cloud IaaS platform. We first present an innovative autonomic computing technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS) to endow the cloud system with distinctive capabilities of perception, detection, reflection, and learning. Then, we propose a BANS-based Prognostics and Health Management (BPHM) technology to enable the cloud system self-dealing with various memory anomalies. AI-based failure prognostics, immediate self-healing, self-learning ability and self-improvement functions are implemented. Experimental results illustrate that the designed BPHM can automatically and intelligently deal with complex memory anomalies in a real cloud system for IaaS, to keep the system much more reliable and healthier."

SEAL is a research project aimed at developing Home Automation (HA) solutions for building energy management, user customization and improved safety of its inhabitants. One of the main problems of HA systems is the wide range of communication standards that commercial devices use. Usually this forces the designer to choose devices from a few brands, limiting the scope of the system and its capabilities. In this context, SmartSEAL is a framework that aims to integrate heterogeneous devices, such as sensors and actuators from different vendors, providing networking features, protocols and interfaces that are easy to implement and dynamically configurable. The core of our system is a Robotics middleware called Robot Operating System (ROS). We adapted the ROS features to the HA problem, designing the network and protocol architectures for this particular needs. These software infrastructure allows for complex HA functions that could be realized only levering the services provided by different devices. The system has been tested in our laboratory and installed in two real environments, Palazzo Fogazzaro in Schio and “Le Case” childhood school in Malo.

The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income.
                  The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic management strategies for nutrients and water. Such practices would augment crop productivity, which, in turn, would allow to cope with increasing future food demands, and find a balanced use of natural resources, also taking other economic sectors—like livestock, urban or energy—into account."

Nowadays, robots as a new type of ubiquitous IoT devices have gained much attention. With the increasing number of distributed multi-robots, such smart environment generates unprecedented amounts of data. Robotic applications are faced with challenges of such big data: the serious real-time assurance and data privacy. Therefore, in order to obtain the big data values via knowledge sharing under the premise of ensuring the real-time data processing and data privacy, we propose a real-time data processing architecture for multi-robots based on the differential federated learning, called RT-robots architecture. A global shared model with differential privacy protection is trained on the cloud iteratively and distributed to multiple edge robots in each round, and the robotic tasks are processed locally in real time. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that our architecture can be applied on multiple robotic recognition tasks, balance the trade-off between the performance and privacy."

These devices need to be tested & validated by replicating production like environment to the extent possible. This means literally handling payments related events like swiping a credit card, tapping a mobile phone or pressing buttons amongst many other things like in real world. Embedded Software development is time consuming as it involves multiple man-machine interactions and dependencies such as managing and handling embedded devices, operating devices (Push buttons, interpret display panels, read receipt printouts etc.) and sharing devices for collaboration within team. During the current pandemic, it was impossible for software teams to travel to office, share devices or even procure necessary devices on time for project related tasks. This caused delay to project delivery and increased Time to market. The paper describes how the team used Capgemini's flexible Robotics as a Service (RaaS) platform that helped during pandemic to automate feasible man-machine interactions using Robotic arms. The paper provides details of the work done by the team that involves internet of things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) to remotely handle and operate hardware and devices thereby completing embedded software development life cycles faster and well within budget while ensuring superior product quality and importantly ensuring team's health and safety. This is novel in Financial Services space."

The ability to continuously release software has enabled a development approach where experimental features are put to use, and, if they stand the test of real use, they remain in production. Examples of such features include machine learning (ML) models, which are usually pre-trained, but can still evolve in production. However, many domains require more plan-driven approach to avoid hazard to environment and humans, and to mitigate risks in the process. In this paper, we start by presenting continuous software engineering practices in a regulated context, and then apply the results to the emerging practice of MLOps, or continuous delivery of ML features. Furthermore, as a practical contribution, we present a case study regarding Oravizio, first CE-certified medical software for assessing the risks of joint replacement surgeries. Towards the end of the paper, we also reflect the Oravizio experiences to MLOps in regulatory context."
