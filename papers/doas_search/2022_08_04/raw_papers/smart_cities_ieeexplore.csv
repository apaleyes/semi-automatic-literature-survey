Despite the enormous potential it brings to citizens' lives, security as well as privacy concerns must still be addressed. A huge volume of data is formed as a result of technological advancements, and machine learning techniques are used to understand useful patterns. Recent advances in ML methods make it possible to handle the huge amount of complex data, enable fast processing, robustness by decentralization, and scalability of real-world systems. In recent decades, cyber security has appeared as an important consideration throughout scientific investigation. According to the World Internet Statistics Report, the Internet grew by 1,114 % from 2000 to 2019, with more than 2 quintillion bytes of data formed daily basis. It also demonstrates that rate of data advancement out of multiple sources is incredibly quick, while hacking tools as well as techniques are also developing at a rapid pace. Machine Learning techniques identify network intrusions and threats by forecasting hazard utilizing data training. The demand for the internet is growing by the day, raising concerns about network security. By blocking malicious things in the network system, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can furnish solutions to several rapidly growing network attacks (e.g., DDoS attack, Ransom ware attack, Botnet attack, and so on). This systematic review summarizes latest framework studies in sensing DDoS threats and investigates a comprehensive evaluation of numerous Ml techniques employed throughout Smart City applications. Furthermore, the goal of this work is to categorize the intrusions utilizing ML algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9807724/,2022 International Conference on IoT and Blockchain Technology (ICIBT),6-8 May 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/SBESC49506.2019.9046078,A Linked Data-Based Semantic Information Model for Smart Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"Smart cities typically involve a myriad of inter-connected systems intended to promote better management of urban and natural resources of cities, thereby contributing to the improve the quality of life of citizens. The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space. Aiming at tackling challenges related to data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and their interconnection.

10.1109/MSM49833.2020.9201644,A Preliminary Investigation of an Autonomous Vehicle Validation Infrastructure for Smart Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"The research and development of autonomous vehicle has entered the era of commercialization. While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI).

Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT). In this paper, the current state of AR for mental health rehabilitation is described and used to motivate the implementation of a proof of concept mental DT rehabilitation system developed by us. Similar AR-IoMT systems can reduce inpatient counts in smart cities where an increase in aging populations is already a concern, and existing healthcare resources may be clogged up due to minor inpatient health checkups.

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated. The use cases are then evaluated based on the national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques. The result of this current work will increase awareness and will assist multimedia security Researchers to continue and develop more robust text-based CAPTCHAs with their security mechanisms capable of protecting the private information of citizens in Smart Cities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547185/,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB),4-6 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Utilization of information will allow consumers to manage their electricity consumption in a more efficient and economical way.

For example, if the intelligent video monitoring system cannot process a large amount of data locally, the data will be uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, how to process data in the cloud without exposing the original data has become an important research topic. We propose a single-server version of somewhat homomorphic encryption cryptosystem based on confused modulo projection theorem named CMP-SWHE, which allows the server to complete blind data processing without seeing the effective information of user data. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the encrypted data on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities. We also discuss how to extend the algorithm to deep learning applications. Compared with other homomorphic encryption cryptosystems and libraries, the results show that our method has obvious advantages in computing efficiency.

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317664,A new modelling framework over temporal graphs for collaborative mobility recommendation systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Over the years, collaborative mobility proved to be an important but challenging component of the smart cities paradigm. One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of what-if decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems. We demonstrate that the use of graphs and time series in multi-dimensional data models can satisfy the requirements of descriptive and predictive analytics in real-world case studies with massive amounts of continuously changing data. The features of the framework are explained in a case study of a complex collaborative mobility system that combines carpooling, carsharing and shared parking. The performance of the framework is tested with a large-scale dataset, performing machine learning tasks and interactive realtime data visualization.

One of the most significant will be real-time, active management of the systems making up a Smart City. Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions. In this paper we propose and validate a Smart City processing architecture that can deliver these benefits by building a digital twin of a city, combining real-time streamed data ingestion, simulation and analytics. Streamed data systems can deliver a real time response with large amount of incoming data but are not suited to time advancing simulations where the interaction between modelled objects is important. We propose a processing architecture that mitigates this limitation by separating object interactions from streamed data processing.

10.1109/ISQED54688.2022.9806291,Hybrid Learning for Orchestrating Deep Learning Inference in Multi-user Edge-cloud Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep-learning-based intelligent services have become prevalent in cyber-physical applications including smart cities and health-care. Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). Identifying optimal orchestration considering the cross-layer opportunities and requirements in the face of varying system dynamics is a challenging multi-dimensional problem. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have been proposed earlier, they suffer from a large number of trial-and-errors during the learning process resulting in excessive time and resource consumption. We present a Hybrid Learning orchestration framework that reduces the number of interactions with the system environment by combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Our Deep Learning inference orchestration strategy employs reinforcement learning to find the optimal orchestration policy. Furthermore, we deploy Hybrid Learning (HL) to accelerate the RL learning process and reduce the number of direct samplings. We demonstrate efficacy of our HL strategy through experimental comparison with state-of-the-art RL-based inference orchestration, demonstrating that our HL strategy accelerates the learning process by up to 166.6&#x00D7;.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9806291/,2022 23rd International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED),6-7 April 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In a smart city environment, tasks may have varying priorities in terms of when and how to serve them; thus, priorities of the tasks have to be considered when making resource management decisions. In this paper, we focus on finding optimal offloading decisions in a three-tier user-edge-cloud architecture while considering different priority classes for the DL-based services and making a trade-off between a task&#x2019;s completion time and the provided accuracy by the DL-based service. We cast the optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) where the objective is to maximize a function called gain of system (GoS) defined based on provided QoS and priority of the tasks. We prove the problem is NP-hard. We then propose an efficient offloading algorithm, called PGUS, that is shown to achieve near-optimal results in terms of the provided GoS.

The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing.

Achieving high accuracy while reading license plates in the real world videos is cumbersome due to complexities like multiple vehicles, high-density traffic in spatial and temporal domains, varying camera angles and illumination, occlusions and multiple resolutions. We present a modular framework for OCR corrections in the chaotic Indian traffic videos that especially involve complex license plate patterns. Such patterns are obtained from a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on video frames. Since such a model reads the text from videos (instead of images), we incorporate multi-frame consensus for generating suggestions in our framework. To ease the correction process, our human-interactive framework first breaks down the multi-vehicle videos into multiple clips, each containing a single vehicle from the video using an object detector and a tracker. Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus. Our framework then selectively presents these extracted clips to the user to verify/correct the predictions with minimal human efforts via interactive suggestions. Such high-quality output can be used to continuously update a large database for surveillance and can be further used to improve the accuracy of deep models in the complex real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8893132/,2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition Workshops (ICDARW),22-25 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/IoTDI54339.2022.00015,To Share or Not to Share: On Location Privacy in IoT Sensor Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Data sharing is crucial for building large datasets which in return are essential for developing and training accurate models in many contexts including smart cities, agriculture, and medical applications. However, shared data may leak private information, such as personal identifiers or location. Past research provides evidence that solely removing these identifiers through pseudonymization is not enough to ensure data privacy protection, since even the pseudonymized data may still contain information about the data provider. In this paper, we show that sensor data may leak a sensor&#x0027;s location even if the latter is not explicitly shared. Sensors are localized by linking sensor data with publicly available environmental data such as local weather. The proposed localization method relies on a machine learning model to predict weather data from sensor observations. Subsequently, the localization algorithm determines the sensor&#x0027;s location from the predicted weather trace using Bayesian filtering. We apply our approach to three real-world datasets where we (1) localize an ozone sensor given its readings, (2) localize a cow from activity parameters recorded with a tracker in the cow&#x0027;s reticulum, (3) localize solar panels based on their solar generation data. The achieved average localization accuracy of 5.68 km, 19.91 km, and 13.68 km on the above tasks, respectively, using data traces with a length of 365 days is remarkable. In addition, we introduce a mechanism, referred to as teleport, to protect location information in sensor data.

Although spaces are technically public, people in the environment may not fully realize the degree to which they may be recorded by the sensor network, which may be perceived as a violation of expected privacy. Therefore, we propose a method to anonymize and blur the voices of people recorded in public spaces-a novel, yet increasingly important task as acoustic sensing becomes ubiquitous in sensor-equipped smart cities. This method is analogous to Google's face blurring in its Street View photographs, which arose from similar concerns in the visual domain. The proposed blurring method aims to anonymize voices by removing both the linguistic content and personal identity from voices, while preserving the rest of the acoustic scene.The method consists of a three-step process. First, voices are separated from non-voice content by a deep U-Net source separation model. Second, we evaluate two approaches to obscure the identity and intelligibility of the extracted voices: a low pass filter to remove most of the formants in the voices, and an inversion of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Finally, the blurred vocal content is mixed with the separated non-vocal signal to reconstruct the acoustic scene.

Such a composite view allows for future improvements in quality of critical details using techniques as super resolution, while at the same time removing unnecessary private information.

In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints.

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago.

10.1109/COMST.2021.3067354,A Survey on Standards for Interoperability and Security in the Internet of Things,IEEE,Journals,"Recently, there has been an increase in studies relating to the Internet of Things (IoT) in various fields, such as smart cities, smart homes, smart factories, and healthcare. In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on international standards related to interoperability and security for IoT environments.

10.1109/TITS.2020.3008935,An Attention-Based Deep Learning Framework for Trip Destination Prediction of Sharing Bike,IEEE,Journals,"With the advancement of communication technology and location acquisition technology in the context of modern smart cities, the sharing bike systems offer users the great autonomy and convenience for the last/first-kilometer trip. Meanwhile, we can now able to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of sharing bike data. How to effectively use these massive data to provide better services is an emerging task. However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152145/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,July 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TCSS.2021.3052231,Cognitive Analytics of Social Media Services for Edge Resource Pre-Allocation in Industrial Manufacturing,IEEE,Journals,"With the development of industrial intelligence, the resource requests of various social media services in smart cities are expanding rapidly. For hosting services, the edge computing (EC) platform for its low-latency resource provisioning is fully explored. However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests. Then based on the analysis results, the optimal resource allocation (ORA) scheme is designed with multiobjective optimization.

In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m1 and m2 values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m1 and m2 are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9127904/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal. The proposed CNN-based system has been tested on both desktop computers and typical WASN devices (such as Raspberry Pi), achieving very fast calculation times that allow real-time operation and a continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096320/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Oct.1, 2020",ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

When these sensors observe a phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, it is expected that collected observations will be correlated in time and space. This article proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheduling mechanism capable of taking advantage of correlated information. The designed solution employs deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed mechanism can determine the frequency with which sensors should transmit their updates, to ensure accurate collection of observations, while simultaneously considering the energy available. The solution is evaluated with multiple data sets containing environmental observations obtained in multiple real deployments. The real observations are leveraged to model the environment with which the mechanism interacts as realistically as possible. The proposed solution can significantly extend the sensors&#x2019; lifetime and is compared to an idealized, all-knowing scheduler to demonstrate that its performance is near optimal.

Thus, with the idea of offloading intensive computing tasks from them to edge nodes (ENs), edge computing emerged to supplement these limited devices. Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion.

The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed.

The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems.

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon. Extensive numerical experiments with real traffic data from the cities of Doha (Qatar) and Aarhus (Denmark) demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for imputing the missing data and predicting the traffic state. It is accurate and efficient and can easily be applied to other traffic datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8917560/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 June 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection. Different use cases are illustrated to signify the proposed system, and results indicate that it can be a step forward for the implementation of smart cities, which is the goal of Jeju Island.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9068215/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents.

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively.

Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities.

Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

Through IoT, these applications have consolidated in the modern world to generate, share, aggregate and analyze large amount of security-critical and privacy sensitive data. As this consolidation gets stronger, the need for security in IoT increases. With first line of defense strategies like cryptography being unsuited due to the resource constrained nature, second line of defense mechanisms are crucial to ensure security in IoT networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of existing second line of defense mechanisms for standardized protocols in IoT networks. The paper analyzes existing mechanisms in three aspects: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Response Systems (IRS). We begin by providing an overview of standardized protocol stack, its layers and defensive security systems in IoT. From there, we build our narrative by presenting an extended taxonomy of IDS, IPS and IRS classifying them on their techniques, deployment, attacks, datasets, evaluation metrics and data pre-processing methods. We then thoroughly review, compare and analyze the research proposals in this context, considering the unique characteristics involved in these systems. Based on the extensive analysis of the existing defensive security systems, the paper also identifies open research challenges and directions for effective design of such systems for IoT networks, which could guide future research in the area.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9127958/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is expected that the needs of a smart city, in regards to traffic and pedestrian traffic systems monitored by cameras/video, can be met by using state-of-the-art artificial-intelligence (AI) based object detectors and trackers. A critical component in designing an effective real-time object detection/tracking pipeline is the understanding of how object density, i.e., the number of objects in a scene, and image-resolution and frame rate influence the performance metrics. This study explores the accuracy and speed metrics with the goal of supporting pipelines that meet the precision and latency needs of a real-time environment. We examine the impact of varying image-resolution, frame rate and object-density on the object detection performance metrics. The experiments on the COSMOS testbed dataset show that varying the frame width from 416 pixels to 832 pixels, and cropping the images to a square resolution, result in the increase in average precision for all object classes. Decreasing the frame rate from 15 fps to 5 fps preserves more than 90&#x0025; of the highest F1 score achieved for all object classes.

And in the most of water-covered areas, such as underpass overpasses, low-lying roads and tunnels, staff gauges have been installed to monitor road water. Therefore, the automatic water level measurement method based on staff gauge image, has drawn more and more attention. So we propose a method for the water level estimation based on images of staff gauge in this paper. First, we proposed a two-step method for segmenting the staff gauge. We implemented the initial positioning by HSV color space and morphological processing, and then we defined a component map to achieve precise positioning. Next, we split the characters on the staff gauge image and recognized those characters through a Convolutional Neural Network. Finally, we measured the water level by using a quadratic function to determine the mapping relationship between pixels and the metric values.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure.

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year).

Briefly defined, such a smart home has special electronics to enable the remote control of automated devices specifically designed for remote health care to ensure the safety of the patient at home and the supervision of their health status. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit responsible for analyzing sensor data, detecting emergency situations, and interfacing between the patient at home and a set of people involved in their health care, such as doctors, nurses, emergency services, and paramedics. Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide $24\times 7$ health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services. However, the open and insecure nature of the internet poses a number of security threats to patient secrecy and privacy. Security design for TMIS is not trivial. Essential security and privacy are provided by mutual authentication and key agreement protocols. This paper proposes an efficient and secure, bilinear pairing-based, unlink-able, mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for TMIS.

It is impractical to aggregate all video streams from hundreds of thousands of cameras for big data analysis. Transcoding the videos to low-bitrate ones is the conventional solution to solve the aggregation bottleneck. However, it is recognized that transcoding will inevitably affect visual feature extraction, consequently degrading the subsequent analysis performance. To address these challenges, we thus propose a new video big data analysis framework, called end-edge-cloud collaborative system. Under the end-edge-cloud collaborative framework, a camera can output two streams simultaneously, including a compressed video stream for viewing and data storage, and a compact feature stream extracted from the original video signals for visual analysis. Video stream and feature stream are synchronized by unified identification. We identify three key technologies to enable the end-edge-cloud collaborative system, including analysis-friendly video coding, visual feature compact descriptor, and user-defined neural network and parameter updating. By real-time feeding only the feature streams into the cloud center, these cameras thus form a large-scale brain-like vision system for the smart city.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569391,Leveraging the Channel as a Sensor: Real-time Vehicle Classification Using Multidimensional Radio-fingerprinting,IEEE,Conferences,"Upcoming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) will transform roads from static resources to dynamic Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) in order to satisfy the requirements of future vehicular traffic in smart city environments. Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context, not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a system for the classification of vehicles based on their radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and maintenance properties. The proposed system is evaluated in a comprehensive field evaluation campaign within an experimental live deployment on a German highway, where it is able to achieve a binary classification success ratio of more than 99% and an overall accuracy of 89.15% for a fine-grained classification task with nine different classes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8569391/,2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),4-7 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although the value of telecommunication data is well believed under the smart city vision, there is no existing solution to transform the data into actionable items for better transportation, mainly due to the lack of appropriate data utilization scheme and the limited processing capability on massive data. This paper presents the first ever system implementation of real-time public transportation crowd prediction based on telecommunication data, relying on the analytical power of advanced neural network models and the computation power of parallel streaming analytic engines. By analyzing the feeds of caller detail record (CDR) from mobile users in interested regions, our system is able to predict the number of metro passengers entering stations, the number of waiting passengers on the platforms and other important metrics on the crowd density.

IoT architectures contribute to critical aspects of our society like transportation, health-care, industry, telecommunications and many others. Security is difficult to be implemented in the IoT context because the embedded devices are resource constrained and deployed in uncontrolled areas, thus being targeted by various security attacks. In scenarios like smart city, IoT networks are populated by both trusted and untrusted transient devices, thus mechanisms for mitigating complex security attacks must be implemented. Embedded networks with near real-time constraints are subject to denial-of-service attacks which can easily affect the applications availability by injecting malicious packets into the network.

10.1109/ICCCN49398.2020.9209747,PDSProxy++: Proactive Proxy Deployment for Confidential Ad-hoc Personalization of AI Services,IEEE,Conferences,"Personal data stores (PDS) typically provide extensions for external confidential processing, allowing ad-hoc personalization of AI services on nearby (third-party) Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, these extensions entail a high initialization overhead due to the underlying cryptographic mechanisms. While some approaches provide first optimizations by pre-initializing this confidential environment, it is unclear which devices need to be pre-initialized - too many unnecessary devices are inefficient, and ad-hoc initialization still takes too long, especially when the user is moving. In this paper, we tackle this initialization issue by proposing PDSProxy++-a PDS extension for proactive multi-hop deployment of AI services. Inspired by the human eye, PDSProxy++ is based on a central cone (foveal vision) and a surrounding smaller circle (peripheral vision), which determine the nearby IoT devices to be initialized. Using a city-wide, real-world smart street lamp dataset and emulations, we show the feasibility of PDSProxy++ and its efficiency: it outperforms the currently-practiced ad-hoc mode and other deployment baselines in different smart city scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9209747/,2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),3-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671866,Placement of DNN Models on Mobile Edge Devices for Effective Video Analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"The pervasive deployment of IoT devices along with the advancements in Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have enabled video analytics at the edge, the so-called Edge AI systems, in support of various large smart-city applications such as automatic road damage evaluation and fire detection. Current solutions require the model developer to make the placement decision by manually assigning models to edge devices. However, an Edge AI solution could entail hundreds of mobile edge devices operating in a large geographical region (e.g., installed on vehicles) with various resource capabilities and different DNN models, hence rendering manual placement ineffective. This paper presents alternative methods to automatically place various models on a diverse set of edge devices, considering the geospatial coverage of video data, resource capabilities of edge devices, and the characteristics of the trained models. First, we mathematically formulate the model placement as an optimization problem which is proven to be NP-Hard. We then propose several heuristics to solve it efficiently and evaluate them with a real-world dataset collected along the 165 bus route trajectories in the City of San Francisco. Our placement algorithm yields a higher recall in object detection and is more robust to the uncertainty of the underlying location context, without sacrificing much utilization cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9671866/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),15-18 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.000-6,Real-Time Traffic Estimation of Unmonitored Roads,IEEE,Conferences,"Due to growing cities, the real-time knowledge about the state of traffic is a critical problem for urban mobility and the road-segments traffic densities estimation influences the efficiency of fundamental smart city services as smart routing, smart planning for evacuations, planning of civil works on the city, etc. Nevertheless, the traffic-related data from navigator Apps (e.g., TomTom, Google, Bing) are too expensive to be acquired. Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it. The proposed reconstruction model has been created by exploiting open and real-time data in the context of Sii-Mobility research project by using Km4City infrastructure in the area of Florence, Italy, for its corresponding Smart City solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8512000/,"2018 IEEE 16th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 16th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 4th Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)",12-15 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Delay due to traffic congestion at the junctions is causing the people to exceed speed limits leading to increased road accidents that demands for effective traffic management.Traffic management is a critical issue in densely populated cities. Currently a fixed quantum of green time is allocated in all the directions irrespective of traffic density leading to unnecessary waiting. Automated object detection and counting technologies can provide benefits to develop the next-generation of AI-supported real-time traffic management systems. In this paper, we present a novel green time estimation algorithm that provides the green signal time in each direction (North, West, South and East) based on the traffic density and use AI and ML techniques for predicting the green time in a short interval. Directional loads were estimated using Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, Logarithmic Regression and time series ARIMA models. Among all, Linear Regression model proved to be best. Inputs include: number of directions, maximum green time for a direction, maximum green cycle time, and departure rates in various directions. Two dictionaries are maintained to store vehicle counts and green time is provided in all the directions. A signal logic scheme is detailed that uses directional threads to get vehicle counts every second by implementing Yolo algorithm for object detection. The cycle starts with North followed by West, South and East.

Wheatman et al. [11] present Runtime Assurance for Distributed Intelligent Control Systems (RADICS) that extends the Simplex architecture [9] to provide runtime assurance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) being controlled by machine learning al-gorithms. RADICS can thus allow designers to guarantee some minimum level of system performance via a safety controller while simultaneously allowing for greater average performance via an artificial intelligence (AI) controller. Existing implementations of RADICS have focused on simulated applications such as vehicular traffic control using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [5] and Flow [12] environments. The aim of this project is to implement RADICS in a physical environment in order to investigate and understand the limitations and challenges of physical deployments. We have selected a water treatment testbed as the application to conduct this evaluation. As a demonstration at ICCPS, we hope to use this testbed deployment to study the impact of real-world issues such as communication latencies, sensor failures, and incomplete information on the RADICS runtime assurance system. We also plan to extend the physical testbed into a hardware-in-the-loop smart city environment where the fidelity of the physical testbed will complement the scalability and flexibility of simulated components. This will allow further evaluation of assurance capabilities such as RADICS before they are deployed in the real world to ensure the safe and reliable operation of intelligent CPS.

10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00051,Smart Energy Management System based on Reconfigurable AI Chip and Electrical Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Almost every larger city in Europe has ambitious smart city projects. This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls. The author has built a specialized laboratory to investigate machine learning technology applied to autonomous systems. In this laboratory miniature autonomous vehicles are developed.

To deal with cyberattacks against such networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built to recognize and alert to the system administrator for further appropriate response. Currently, machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) has been explored and is still being developed. However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack. Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017.

10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7,Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202791/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011477,A Data Security Enhanced Access Control Mechanism in Mobile Edge Computing,IEEE,Journals,"Mobile edge computing, with characteristics of position awareness, mobile support, low latency, decentralization, and distribution, has received widespread attention from industry and academia, and has been applied to application areas such as intelligent transportation, smart city, and real-time big data analysis. However, it also brings the new security threats, especially data security threats during data access that leads to unauthorized/unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure of data, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore, access control, as an important method to ensure the security of user data during data access, began to be applied to mobile edge computing. However, the existing access control has the disadvantages of coarse-grain, poor flexibility and accuracy, lack of internal attack considerations, etc., which cannot meet the needs of data security in practical applications of mobile edge computing. In this paper, a data security enhanced Fine-Grained Access Control mechanism (FGAC) is proposed to ensure data security during data access in mobile edge computing. In FGAC, a dynamic fine-grained trusted user grouping scheme based on attributes and metagraphs theory was first designed. Secondly, the scheme was combined with the traditional role-based access control mechanism to assign roles to users based on user group credibility. And then, based on attribute matching the user authentication further verifies whether the user is allowed to perform the access operations to achieve fine-grained data protection. Experimental results show that FGAC can effectively identify malicious users and make group adjustments, while achieving fine-grained access control and assure the data security during the data access process in mobile edge computing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146646/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TASE.2021.3077537,A Hybrid Prediction Method for Realistic Network Traffic With Temporal Convolutional Network and LSTM,IEEE,Journals,"Accurate and real-time prediction of network traffic can not only help system operators allocate resources rationally according to their actual business needs but also help them assess the performance of a network and analyze its health status. In recent years, neural networks have been proved suitable to predict time series data, represented by the model of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and a temporal convolutional network (TCN). This article proposes a novel hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM) for such network traffic prediction, which synergistically combines the power of the Savitzky&#x2013;Golay (SG) filter, the TCN, as well as the LSTM. ST-LSTM employs a three-phase end-to-end methodology serving time series prediction. It first eliminates noise in raw data using the SG filter, then extracts short-term features from sequences applying the TCN, and then captures the long-term dependence in the data exploiting the LSTM. Experimental results over real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ST-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;This work considers real-time and high-accuracy prediction of network traffic. It is highly important to well predict network traffic by capturing long-term dependence and effectively extracting high- and low-frequency information from time series data. Yet, it is a big challenge to achieve it because there are unstable characteristics and strong nonlinear features in the network traffic due to continuous expansion of network scale and fast emergence of new services. Current prediction methods usually have oversimplified theoretical assumptions, need significant time and memory, or suffer problems of gradient disappearance or early convergence. Thus, they fail to effectively capture the nonlinear characteristics of large-scale network sequences. This work proposes a hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM), which integrates the merits of the Savitzky&#x2013;Golay filter, the temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the long short-term memory (LSTM), serving as smoothing time series, capturing short-term local features, and capturing long-term dependence, respectively. Experimental results based on the real-life dataset demonstrate that it achieves better prediction accuracy than its state-of-the-art peers, including the TCN and the LSTM.

10.1109/JIOT.2017.2761801,A Privacy-Aware Architecture at the Edge for Autonomous Real-Time Identity Reidentification in Crowds,IEEE,Journals,"The capability to perform identity reidentification in a crowd (e.g., from video feeds from a network of cameras, and social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram) efficiently and effectively is increasingly important, as evident in recent real-world events (e.g., terrorist attacks on places of mass gatherings in different countries). However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification. Evaluations using mixed datasets in real-time demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a 2.6% accuracy over other state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063888/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Aug. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The sensor data streams generated from these applications are largely dynamic, heterogeneous, and often geographically distributed over large areas. For high-value use in business, industry and services, these data streams must be mined to extract insightful knowledge, such as about monitoring (e.g., discovering certain behaviors over a deployed area) or network diagnostics (e.g., predicting faulty sensor nodes). However, due to the inherent constraints of sensor networks and application requirements, traditional data mining techniques cannot be directly used to mine IoT data streams efficiently and accurately in real-time. In the last decade, a number of works have been reported in the literature proposing behavioral pattern mining algorithms for sensor networks. This paper presents the technical challenges that need to be considered for mining sensor data. It then provides a thorough review of the mining techniques proposed in the recent literature to mine behavioral patterns from sensor data in IoT, and their characteristics and differences are highlighted and compared.

10.1109/JIOT.2021.3100068,ASTCN: An Attentive Spatial–Temporal Convolutional Network for Flow Prediction,IEEE,Journals,"Flow prediction attracts intensive research interests, since it can offer essential support to many crucial problems in public safety and smart city, e.g., epidemic spread prediction and medical resource allocation optimization. Among all the models in flow prediction, deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks) are popular and outperform other statistics and machine learning models, since they can learn intrinsic structures and extract features from spatial–temporal (ST) data. However, most of them set strict temporal periods in the prediction or separate the interaction between spatial and temporal correlations. Therefore, the prediction accuracy is affected. To overcome the difficulties, we propose a flow prediction network attentive spatial–temporal convolutional network (ASTCN), which can effectively handle large-scale flow data and learn complex features. In ASTCN, we leverage an attention mechanism to overcome the previous problem of strict temporal periods, and can effectively fuse ST data with multiple factors from different time-series sources. Furthermore, we propose a causal 3-D convolutional layer based on temporal convolutional networks (TCNs). It can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to improve the prediction accuracy. We comprehensively conducted our experiments based on real-world data sets. Experimental results show that ASTCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 3.78% in root mean square error.

10.1109/TII.2022.3162306,Guest Editorial: Special Section on Distributed Intelligence Over Internet of Things,IEEE,Journals,"N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing, Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be applied widely in wireless IoT networks. To reduce the resource consumption in CNN-based applications, Jia et al. [6] propose the CNN-based Resource Optimization APProach which utilizes model compression and computation sharing to optimize inner-model and inter-model respectively, and the comparison results show the superior performance in scalability and the decrease of resource cost. In mobile crowdsensing activities, Gao et al. [4] propose a differential Location Privacy-preserving Mechanism based on Trajectory obfuscation (LPMT) to protect the location privacy of mobile users, which includes three operations: stay points extraction, stay points obfuscation and stay points sampling. In order to mimic the task-free bottom-up visual attention process by predicting salient regions on natural images, Umer et al.

The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$CoGS$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and the lead time (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$LT$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large-scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this article proposes a multipopulation ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLSs). First, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$CoGS$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$LT$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, which helps to search in the biobjective space sufficiently. Second, with the considerations of the problem-related knowledge, a priority-based solution construction method, a rank-based heuristic strategy, and an objective-oriented global pheromone updating strategy are proposed. Third, to speed up the convergence, especially for large-scale MOSCC instances, two knowledge-based local searches are designed to minimize <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$CoGS$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$LT$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of solutions, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on both the instances from the real life and the randomly generated instances with different problem scales. The results show that MPACS-KLS is superior to the contestant algorithms, especially on the large-scale MOSCC instances, which significantly extends the AI and optimization techniques in practical applications of the smart city.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9486864/,IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,June 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper addressed these two problems by proposing a correlation filter-based tracker. Fog computing platform was deployed to accelerate the proposed tracking approach. The tracker was constructed by multiple positions’ detections and alternate templates. The detection position was repositioned according to the estimated speed of target by an optical flow method, and the alternate template was stored with a template update mechanism, which is all computed at the edge.

The selection of suitable car parks could be influenced by multiple factors-e.g., the walking distance to destination, driving and waiting time, parking prices, availability, and accessibility-while the availability of unused parking slots might depend on parking location, events in the area, traffic flow, and weather conditions. This paper presents a set of metrics and techniques to predict the number of available parking slots in city garages with gates. With this aim, we have considered three different predictive techniques, while comparing different approaches. The comparison has been performed according to the data collected in a dozen of garages in the area of Florence by using Sii-Mobility National Research Project and Km4City infrastructure. The resulting solution has demonstrated that a Bayesian regularized neural network exploiting historical data, weather condition, and traffic flow data can offer a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available slots in terms of flexibility and robustness to critical cases.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056695,Super Resolution Deduction: Inferring Fine-Grained Capacity for Urban Signal Station Deployment,IEEE,Journals,"With the boosting of mobile devices, wireless sensor networks, and the internet of things, abundant multi-modal data, such as GPS signal, sensor data, are produced intentionally or unintentionally, which can represent the people's active patterns, vehicle's routes, and city's flows to develop a smart city. These multi-modal data are usually transmitted and received by signal stations deployed in the city. However, reasonably choosing the signal stations' locations is still an open issue for enhancing people's life quality in the smart city. To this end, we propose the Super Resolution Deduction (SRD) model for solving the signal station selection problem. SRD first initializes the city map as a coarse-grained heat map representing the capacity of the signal stations. Then an image-based super-resolution deduction model is proposed to obtain a fine-grained signal station capacity for deploying. To be specific, we employ Dense Block to capture the spatio-temporal correlations, C-Attention to selectively enhance useful feature maps, and S-Distribution to impose structural constraints. By sharing the GPS data load with the new deployment of signal stations, we ensure the smart city's efficiency and effectiveness.

However, the limitations of cache capacity make it difficult to develop an effective common caching framework that satisfies diverse user preferences. In this article, we propose a new content caching strategy that maximizes the cache hit ratio through flexible prediction in dynamically changing network and user environments. It is based on a hierarchical deep learning architecture: long short-term memory (LSTM)-based local learning and ensemble-based meta-learning. First, as a local learning model, we employ an LSTM method with seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (STL)-based preprocessing. It identifies the attributes for demand prediction on the contents in various demographic user groups. Second, as a metalearning model, we employ a regression-based ensemble learning method, which uses an online convex optimization framework and exhibits sublinear “regret” performance. It orchestrates the obtained multiple demographic user preferences into a unified caching strategy in real time. Extensive experiments were conducted on the popular MovieLens data sets. It was shown that the proposed control provides up to a 30% higher cache hit ratio than conventional representative algorithms and a near-optimal cache hit ratio within approximately 9% of the optimal caching scheme with perfect prior knowledge of content popularity. The proposed learning and caching control can be implemented as a core function of the 5G/6G standard’s network data analytic function (NWDAF) module.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9488291/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 March1, 2022",ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Despite intensive research on federated learning, existing schemes are vulnerable to attacks and can hardly meet the security requirements for real-world applications. The problem of designing a secure federated learning framework to ensure the correctness of training procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains open.

These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner.

However, there are some issues to be addressed, such as the low accuracy of current urban road short-term traffic flow prediction and the high traffic congestion rate resulted from most urban road traffic signal control methods. In this paper, we propose a short-term traffic flow prediction method based on graph convolution neural network and Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence) model, which can excavate the spatial and temporal relationships among road traffic flows and jointly perform multi-step predictions to realize a more accurate prediction of short-term traffic flows. In addition, a regional traffic signal control method based on the back-pressure algorithm is proposed, which is based on single-point traffic signal control to establish a distributed regional traffic signal coordination control model, thus effectively realizing dynamic traffic control with a lower congestion rate. Compared to other related methods, we compare and simulate the current short-term traffic flow prediction and urban road traffic signal control methods via actual experiments to demonstrate the practicability of our method. Based on the two method, we conduct two experiment using real world data and compare our method with the current traffic flow prediction and traffic signal control method.

First, our short-term traffic flow prediction method is clearly outperformed than the LSTM algorithm and ARIMA algorithm in terms of root mean square error, average absolute error and average absolute percentage error. Second, compared with the timing traffic signal control method, our regional traffic signal control method greatly reduces the average waiting time, average travel time and average number of waiting vehicles.

10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917004,A neuro-dynamic programming approach for perimeter control of two urban regions with macroscopic fundamental diagrams,IEEE,Conferences,"Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model is widely used to describe urban traffic dynamic system. Based on the MFD model, perimeter control methods are developed to ensure the efficiency of the system. However, most existing perimeter control methods would suffer from two shortcomings, i.e., linearization of the MFD function, accurate calibration of MFD and travel demand. These prerequisites would undermine the performance of the system if an accurate calibration cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, an optimization scheme of network performance without excessive knowledge of state variables but based on traffic data is preferable. In this study, an optimal feedback controller based on the neuro-dynamic that approximates the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) is introduced.

10.1109/CCST.2014.6987009,A reasoning approach for modelling and predicting terroristic attacks in urban environments,IEEE,Conferences,"During the last decade the world has witnessed a number of terroristic attacks and security incidents exposing numerous vulnerabilities of the urban environment. Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques. A prototype implementation of layer is presented in a simulated validation scenario. The prototype allows an expert user to monitor threat probabilities for different physical environments, and influence the sensitivity of these environments in real-time as well as and provide feedback for adapting the machine learning models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6987009/,2014 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST),13-16 Oct. 2014,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals. For training the networks a dataset was created from several hours of riding an electric bicycle in structured and unstructured environments of a city. In addition the networks have been implemented on an embedded GPU platform to investigate the real-time capability of the presented approach. The networks were configured and trained to predict five seconds into the future with a sample time of 0.2 s. The results of each network are presented and compared against each other. The results show that the implemented networks are capable of predicting a trajectory in short to mid-term (1 - 3 s) with good accuracy while having difficulties predicting turn maneuvers in long-term range (3 - 5 s) due to the lack of road layout information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564999/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, literature on the simultaneous introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is very scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to minimise waiting times. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling a real-world intersection serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are proposed. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK, to which the agent has been since deployed. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the quantities used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565054/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

Nevertheless, manually labeling semantic segmentation dataset with pixel-level annotation is extremely labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-level feature alignment framework for cross-domain semantic segmentation of urban scenes by exploiting generative adversarial networks. In the proposed multi-level feature alignment method, we first translate images from one domain to another one. Then the discriminative feature representations extracted by the deep neural network are concatenated, followed by domain adversarial learning to make the intermediate feature distribution of the target domain images close to those in the source domain. With these domain adaptation techniques, models trained with images in the source domain where the labels are easy to acquire can be deployed to the target domain where the labels are scarce.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling.

DroneSense selects a minimum number of Points of Interest (POIs) to schedule drones for physical data sensing and then infers the parking occupancy of the remaining POIs to meet the overall quality requirement. However, drone-based sensing is different from human-centric crowdsensing, resulting in a series of new problems, including which POIs are visited first, when and where to charge drones, which drones to charge first, how much to charge, and when to stop the scheduling. To this end, we design a holistic solution, including context-aware matrix factorization for parking occupancy data inference, progressive determination of task quantity, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based task selection, energy-aware DRL-based task scheduling, and adaptive charger scheduling. Extensive experiments with a real-world on-street parking dataset from Shenzhen, China demonstrate the obvious advantages of DroneSense.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796795/,IEEE INFOCOM 2022 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,2-5 May 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/DCOSS.2019.00103,Emerging Urban Challenge: RPAS/UAVs in Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"An emerging urban challenge will be the proliferation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or drones, as their usage grows and drones fill the urban skies. Urban airspace will include many more Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps will also increase. Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and AI techniques to detect the presence of RPAS. Preliminary results show promise for this agile IoT method as a key solution to this emerging urban challenge.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804735/,2019 15th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS),29-31 May 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional water-level sensors for large-scale river can detect water-level rising, though they have limitations in detecting urban river dyke height to alert about flooding. This is a result of various riverside environmental limitations. Additionally, previous prediction methods are difficult to detect CWF flooding with high accuracy because water rising differ depends on a location's environment. Therefore, we propose a detection scheme for CWF by developing a water-level sensor system that works in various installation environments using infrared image processing with both low installation and operation cost. We implemented a CWF prediction system that produces accurate and early predictions using a Linear Regression (LR) of deep learning approach with data assimilation. Evaluating based on actual installations (over 1,000 days, 13 locations), our system proved to accurately monitor and predict water-level rising after 5 minutes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7808626/,2016 IEEE SENSORS,30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2016,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions. In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic traffic flows and then develop a dynamic traffic flow generator. We extract the stochastic OD matrix from the trajectory data, design an efficient neural network to the predict successive stochastic OD matrices, and deploy our model on a real-world road network.

Efficiently and correctly predicting the future flows of various regions can improve traffic resources scheduling and reduce the possibility of accidents. However, factors which affect the change of traffic passenger flows are complex, including interlaced lines and stations in large areas, diversified traveling demands for people, accidents and bad weathers. So the predicting algorithms or models should be more sensitive to multiply elements and their effecting patterns. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling method for urban traffic passenger flows. Instead of the grid matrices, we quantify the relationship between stations and represent it by a undirected graph. Then we sort the stations by their passenger flows and construct the two-channels graph flows matrices as the input of deep convolutional neural networks. To increase the temporal information of inputs, we also combine the input matrices with recent historical samples. In addition, we add date markers to correct the final prediction flows to further improve the accuracy. Finally we evaluate our model with the real Beijing subway data and compare with other traditional models on short-term passenger flows prediction tasks.

However, it is non-trivial to evaluate a new transit plan, such as a new bus route or a new subway line, of its future ridership prior to actual deployment, since the travel preferences of passengers along the planned routes may vary. In this paper, we make the first attempt to model passengers' preferences of making various transit choices using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Moreover, we develop a novel inverse preference learning algorithm to infer the passengers' preferences and predict the future human behavior changes, e.g., ridership, of a new urban transit plan before its deployment. We validate our proposed framework using a unique real-world dataset (from Shenzhen, China) with three subway lines opened during the data time span.

10.1109/DCOSS.2019.00099,Mining Human Mobility from Social Media to support Urban Computing Applications,IEEE,Conferences,"Analysis of people trajectories is key for implementing effective urban computing applications. Nowadays, social media represent one of the main sources of information concerning human dynamics within urban context, allowing to enhance the comprehension of people behaviour, including human mobility regularities. The paper presents an approach to predict human mobility by exploiting Twitter data. The prediction method is based on a hybrid approach combining frequent pattern mining, trajectory similarity and supervised classification. The trajectory pattern similarity allows to identify the more suitable historic patterns to exploit for the prediction of the user next location. If none of the patterns satisfies the similarity threshold, a set of spatio-temporal features characterizing locations and movements among them are combined into a supervised learning approach based on M5 model trees. The experimental results obtained by using a real-world dataset show that the proposed method is effective in predicting the user's next places achieving a remarkable accuracy and prediction rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804822/,2019 15th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS),29-31 May 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488713,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Urban Crowd Sensing with For-Hire Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently, vehicular crowd sensing (VCS) that leverages sensor-equipped urban vehicles to collect city-scale sensory data has emerged as a promising paradigm for urban sensing. Nowadays, a wide spectrum of VCS tasks are carried out by for-hire vehicles (FHVs) due to various hardware and software constraints that are difficult for private vehicles to satisfy. However, such FHV-enabled VCS systems face a fundamental yet unsolved problem of striking a balance between the order-serving and sensing outcomes. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (GCC-MARL) framework, which helps FHVs make distributed routing decisions that cooperatively optimize the system-wide global objective. Specifically, GCC-MARL meticulously assigns credits to agents in the training process to effectively stimulate cooperation, represents agents' actions by a carefully chosen statistics to cope with the variable agent scales, and integrates graph convolution to capture useful spatial features from complex large-scale urban road networks. We conduct extensive experiments with a real-world dataset collected in Shenzhen, China, containing around 1 million trajectories and 50 thousand orders of 553 taxis per-day from June 1st to 30th, 2017.

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, it is highly costly and time-consuming to obtain many travel time data. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm structure to calculate the travel time which utilize neural network to dynamically predict future speed and employ data fusion to integrate the speed data of different detectors in a urban expressway link. Based on the algorithm structure, two practical travel time prediction algorithms, called as Space Discretization Travel Time Calculation Algorithm (SDTCM) and Speed Integral Travel Time Calculation Method (SITCM), were developed by the discretization of the space and integral of the predicted speed. Vehicle plate recognition technology was used to collect the real travel time data in the test section on Beijing Third-Ring urban expressway to evaluate the algorithms. The obtained results show that the average prediction error of two algorithms are both less than 10% which can meet the requirement of the field applications and the algorithms are easy to be implemented as no travel time data collection are needed in advance. The two algorithms have some advantages and disadvantages over each other in accuracy and smoothness.

To respond to this situation, there have been lots of researches on aerial base stations (BSs) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the mobile user. Aerial BS has the advantage of providing flexible communication range by avoiding obstacles such as buildings in urban areas through 3D positioning. However, finding an optimal point for aerial BS considering the variance of user's requirements, movement, and obstacles in real time is difficult problem to solve. Therefore, it is necessary to find an approximate optimal point for applying to the real-time flight path control of aerial BS.

10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966128,Scalable deep traffic flow neural networks for urban traffic congestion prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Tracking congestion throughout the network road is a critical component of Intelligent transportation network management systems. Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes. We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in realtime based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California.

UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes.

In this paper, based on over 890 million records of vehicles collected on ramps in Hangzhou, China, we established dynamic congestion threshold for each road segment with external factors. Based on such dynamic congestion threshold, we further clustered the congestion evolution patterns, and designed adaptive ramp controller which could switch the controller parameter according to the predicted congestion evolution pattern. Finally, in order to show the performance among different strategies, we introduced three baseline groups, which are `without Controller', `ALINEA controller', and `Direct RBF(radial basis function)-neural network controller', respectively.The evaluation of proposed controller design over real large-scale data indicated that our method achieves 8.4%(7.2%), 4.62%(9.48%) efficiency improvement in terms of average speed in km/h (average traffic flow in veh/h) than the performance with normal ALINEA controller and RBF-neural network controller respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8815863/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Generally, an adaptive signal control system fine-tunes signal timing parameters based on pre-defined control hyperparameters using instantaneous traffic detection information. Once traffic pattern changes, those hyperparameters (e.g., maximum and minimum green times) need to be adjusted according to the evolution of traffic dynamics over a very short-term period. Such adjustment processes are usually conducted by professional and experienced traffic engineers. Here we present a human-in-the-loop parallel learning framework and its utilization in an end-to-end recommendation system that mimics and enhances professional signal control engineers' behaviors. The system has been deployed into a real-world application for an extended period in Hangzhou, China, where signal control hyperparameters are recommended based on large-scale multidimensional traffic datasets.

Due to the constrained resource devices and hazardous deployment, urban sensing is vulnerable to interference and destruction of external factors or the impact of external environmental emergencies. Abnormal data, outliers, or anomalies have affected the utility in various domains seriously. Timely and accurate detection of unexpected events, monitoring of network performance, and anomaly detection of data flow are of great significance to improve the decision-making ability of the system. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method for urban sensing based on sequential data and credibility. First, based on Bayesian methods, a reputation model is established for the selection of credible sample points. Second, aiming at the problem that the threshold range is difficult to determine in the traditional method, the pivot quantity is defined by using the median of the credible sample, and the confidence interval can be estimated to quantify the deviation degree of the sensor data. Finally, an anomaly data identification and source verification approach is proposed to distinguish errors and events accurately.

A Causal Evaluative Review and Methodical Redirection for Intelligence Systems,IEEE,Journals,"The chronic growth of networked complexities in today's world, now require highly efficient evolvable systems. However, diverse open issues and inabilities are facing urban planning practice and social sciences due to the limitations of artificial intelligence planning tools. These incapacities have relatively limited our ability to perceive and handle possible present and future temperamental situations in socio-physical contexts and in real-time modes. Here, we theoretically present two simple philosophical and systematic causal models to help software engineers to understand this philosophical and complexity dilemma from an urban planning perspective. The first model evaluates the reliance on perceptual and bounding trajectories. It discusses discrete and finite-expert systems that perceive specific parts of self-organization's complexities, while bounding limited facets only of general intelligence to address certain issues in urban planning and social contexts. This implies the second causal model that is based on aligning to urban self-organizational happenings, by putting philosophical foundations for a responsive artificial superintelligence (ASI).

However, the existing CNN-based feature extraction algorithms, especially residual network, cannot obtain powerful semantic information in the vehicle detection task, and thus suffer from the problem of a missing detection, error detection, or repeated detection. In this paper, we present a connect-and-merge convolutional neural network (CMNet) for fast detecting vehicles in complex scenes. First, we propose a connect-and-merge residual network (CMRN) for performing feature extraction. Specifically, the CMRN assembles residual branches in parallel through a connect-and-merge mapping: Connect the input to the outputs of two residual branches separately (Connect), and merge the outputs of the connection as the input of the subsequent residual block (Merge), respectively. Second, we present a multi-scale prediction network (MSPN) to accurately regress the vehicle shape and classify vehicle fine-grained categories. In addition, the feature maps from the CMRN are merged with their corresponding upsampled features from the MSPN using concatenation. Thus, we can improve the information flow of the framework and make it easy to train.

It is challenging for a system-level optimisation to deal with while empirically maintaining quality of service. The 5G load balancing aims to address this problem by transferring the extra traffic from a high-load cell to its neighbouring idle cells. In recent literature, controller and machine learning algorithms are applied to assist the self-optimising and proactive schemes in drawing load balancing decisions. However, these algorithms lack the ability of forecasting upcoming high traffic demands, especially during popular events. This shortage leads to cold-start problems because of reacting to the changes in the heterogeneous dense deployment. Notably, the hotspots corresponding with skew load distribution will result in low convergence speed. To address these problems, this paper contributes to three aspects. Firstly, urban event detection is proposed to forecast the changes in cellular hotspots based on Twitter data for enabling context-awareness. Secondly, a proactive 5G load balancing strategy is simulated considering the prediction of the skewed-distributed hotspots in urban areas. Finally, we optimise this context-aware proactive load balancing strategy by forecasting the best activation time.

Convolutional neural networks are developed, trained, and evaluated with the use of images from a moving vehicle camera.

Recently, deep learning based approaches are proposed to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of the traffic passenger flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle some complex factors such as hybrid transportation lines, mixed traffic, transfer stations, and some extreme weathers. Considering the multi-channel and irregularity properties of urban traffic passenger flows in different transportation lines, a more efficient and fine-grained deep spatio-temporal feature learning model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM network model called DST-ICRL for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model the passenger flows among different traffic lines in a transportation network into multi-channel matrices analogous to the RGB pixel matrices of an image. Then, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates irregular convolutional residential network and LSTM units to learn the spatial-temporal feature representations. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample both the short-term and long-term historical traffic data, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows. In addition, we also fuse other external factors further to facilitate a real-time prediction.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in COx sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Federated learning is a promising paradigm for distributed edge computing, which enables edge nodes to train models locally without transmitting their data to a server. However, the security and privacy concerns of federated learning hinder its wide deployment in urban applications such as vehicular networks. In this article, we propose a differentially private asynchronous federated learning scheme for resource sharing in vehicular networks.

Knowing the expected demand enables transit operators to deploy real-time control strategies in advance of the demand surge, and minimize the impact of abnormalities on the service quality and passenger experience. One of the most useful applications of demand prediction models in transit is in predicting the congestion on station platforms and crowding on vehicles. These require information about the origin-destination (OD) demand, providing a detailed profile of how and when passengers enter and exit the service. However, existing work in the literature is limited and overwhelmingly focuses on forecasting passenger <i>arrivals</i> at stations. This information, while useful, is incomplete for many practical applications. We address this gap by developing a scalable methodology for real-time, short-term OD demand prediction in transit systems. Our proposed model consists of three modules: multi-resolution spatial feature extraction module for capturing the local spatial dependencies with a channel-wise attention block, auxiliary information encoding module (AIE) for encoding the exogenous information, and a module for capturing the temporal evolution of demand. The OD demand at time <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$t$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, represented as a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N \times N$ </tex-math></inline-formula> matrix, is processed in two separate branches. In one branch we use the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the demand into its different time and frequency variations, detecting patterns that are not visible in the raw data. In the other, three convolutional neural network (CNN) layers are utilized to learn the spatial dependencies from the OD demand directly. Instead of treating each channel of the resultant transformation equally, we use a <i>squeeze-and-excitation</i> layer to weight feature maps based on their contribution to the final prediction. A Convolutional Long Short-term Memory network (ConvLSTM) is then used to capture the temporal evolution of demand. The approach is demonstrated through a case study using 2 months of Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system.

To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R > 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ > 0.6 up to κ > 0.8).

Among these events, urban flash floods are particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur, and because of the population density of cities.

However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented. This sensing device is based on the combination of ultrasonic range finding with remote temperature sensing, and can sense both phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, using a combination of L1-regularized reconstruction and artificial neural networks to process measurement data. Second, corresponding algorithms have been implemented on a low-power wireless sensor platform, and their performance in water level estimation in a six months test involving four different sensors is illustrated.

In this article, we present a new algorithm, the deep growing self-organizing map (deep GSOM) algorithm that addresses these challenges. Deep GSOM incrementally generates a latent representation of situational awareness from high entropy to low entropy IoT data streams. It utilizes an implementation of the fuzzy integral to define a metric that can be moved across spatial and temporal situations to profile the density of congestion. We have also expanded deep GSOM into an IoT platform that can collate, aggregate, and process an entire network of IoT data streams.

Following that, the refined anomaly characteristics are generated from adjacent regions, adjacent periods and historical anomalies.

On the other hand, computer vision as a crucial bridge between urban world and artificial intelligence is playing a key role in urban computing and intelligence. Conventional particle filter is derived from Karman filter, which theoretically based on Monte Carlo method. Sequential importance resampling (SIR) is implemented in conventional particle filter to avoid the degeneracy problem. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the resampling algorithm in the traditional particle filter, we proposed an optimized particle filter using the maximum variance weight segmentation resampling algorithm in this paper, which improved the performance of particle filter.

In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. Moreover, we propose two models to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes: (1) a light-weight gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) based recommendation model; and (2) a multi-task wide and deep learning (MTWDL) based recommendation model.

It can significantly reduce the sensing cost while ensuring high data quality. Recently, large urban sensing systems often require multiple types of sensing data (e.g., publish two tasks on temperature and humidity respectively) to form a multi-dimensional urban sensing map. These multiple types of sensing data hold some inherent correlations, which can be leveraged to further reduce the sensing cost and improve the accuracy of the inferred results. In this paper, we study the multi-dimensional urban sensing in sparse MCS to jointly address the data inference and cell selection for multi-task scenarios. We exploit the intra- and inter-task correlations in data inference to deduce the data of the unsensed cells through the multi-task compressive sensing and then learn and select the most effective 〈cell, task〉 pairs by using reinforcement learning. To effectively capture the intra- and inter-task correlations in cell selection, we design a network structure with multiple branches, where branches extract the intra-task correlations for each task, respectively, and then catenates the results from all branches to capture the inter-task correlations among the multiple tasks. In addition, we present a two-stage online framework for reinforcement learning in practical use, including training and running phases.

In this work, a new visual-based algorithm for identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZ) in crowded scenarios is proposed, considering a camera mounted on a UAV, where the people in the scene move with unknown dynamics. To do so, a density map is generated for each image frame using a Deep Neural Network, from where a binary occupancy map is obtained aiming to overestimate the people's location for security reasons. Then, the occupancy map is projected to the head's plane, and the SLZ candidates are obtained as circular regions with a minimum security radius, within the head's plane. Finally, to keep track of the SLZ candidates, a multiple instance tracking algorithm is implemented using Kalman Filters along with the Hungarian algorithm for data association. Several scenarios were studied to prove the validity of the proposed strategy, including public datasets and real uncontrolled scenarios with people moving in public squares, taken from a UAV in flight.

Since most existing approaches mainly consider the general vehicle appearance for reidentification while overlooking the distinct vehicle identifier, such as the license plate number, they attain suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose PROVID, a PROgressive Vehicle re-IDentification framework based on deep neural networks. In particular, our framework not only utilizes the multimodality data in large-scale video surveillance, such as visual features, license plates, camera locations, and contextual information, but also considers vehicle reidentification in two progressive procedures: coarse-to-fine search in the feature domain, and near-to-distant search in the physical space. Furthermore, to evaluate our progressive search framework and facilitate related research, we construct the VeRi dataset, which is the most comprehensive dataset from real-world surveillance videos. It not only provides large numbers of vehicles with varied labels and sufficient cross-camera recurrences but also contains license plate numbers and contextual information.

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

Many existing studies on traffic speed prediction are based on convolutional neural networks, and these have primarily focused on capturing the spatial proximity among different road segments. However, the real cause of the spread of traffic congestion is the connectivity of these road segments, rather than their spatial proximity. This makes it very challenging to improve prediction accuracy. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), the connectivity of these road segments can be modeled as a graph in which the properties of road segments and the connections between them are embedded as the properties of the nodes and edges, respectively. This paper describes a novel approach that combines the advantages of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and GNNs. Specifically, the evolution of traffic conditions on road networks is modeled as a sequence of graphs. Thus, the proposed SeqGNN model represents both the inputs and outputs as graph sequences.

The strong heterogeneity of urban areas poses a big challenge for accurate near realtime flood mapping. However, previous studies on automatic methods for urban flood mapping perform infeasible in near realtime or fail to generalize well to other floods, for several reasons. First, multitemporal pixel-wise flood mapping requires accurate image registration, hindering the efficiency of large-scale processing. Although automatic image registration has been investigated, precisely coregistered multitemporal image sequence requires time-consuming fine tuning. Additionally, the floods may lead to the loss of many corresponding image points across multitemporal images for accurate coregistration. Second, existing unsupervised methods generally rely on hand-crafted features for floodwater detection. Such features may not well represent the patterns of floodwaters in different areas due to inconsistent weather conditions, illumination, and floodwater spectra. This article proposes a self-supervised learning framework for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery. Patch-wise change vector analysis is used with patch features learned through a self-supervised autoencoder to produce patch-wise change maps showing potentially flood-affected areas. Postprocessing including spectral and spatial filtering is applied to these patch-wise change maps to remove nonflood related changes. Final flood maps and parameter sensitivities were evaluated using several performance metrics. Two flood events from areas with differing degrees of urbanization were considered: Hurricane Harvey flood (2017) in Houston, Texas, and Hurricane Florence flood (2018) in Lumberton, North Carolina.

Various data issues, traffic signals, stops signs and other flow inhibitors of the network-level traffic state make the analysis more difficult than that under the small-scale local traffic state. To address this challenge, we propose a method based on spatio-temporal non-negative matrix factorization (ST-NMF), which is used for road network traffic pattern analysis. The method can be further extended to traffic data reconstruction and traffic prediction. In order to analyze traffic patterns, the proposed spatio-temporal non-negative matrix factorization model represents the network traffic as a linear combination of several basic patterns, which is also interpreted as the dynamics of spatial traffic characteristics over time in low-dimensional space. By the visual display of the spatial and temporal patterns and the assistance of clustering methods, the traffic pattern features are extracted. In the extended applications, data reconstruction relies on the sampling representation of missing data by ST-NMF, and data prediction is based on the prediction of the temporal patterns by ST-NMF. Through our method, we can not only obtain a high-quality data foundation, but also explore typical spatio-temporal patterns and general predictions of the future traffic state.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2822547,Wireless Vehicular Check-in Protocol at Urban Road Intersection,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent organization of the traffic flow at an urban intersection is fundamentally important in intelligent transportation systems. Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation.

Accurate forecasting will guarantee that electrical equipments such as electric traction systems for trains work under safe, robust and efficient status. Recently, many studies adopt the learning-based methods to achieve the prediction of power demand.

Then, we use an algorithm called Adaboost to combine weak learners with strong learners, which can increase the accuracy significantly in real-world scenarios. The prediction of the load status is realized by analyzing the information of historical distribution transformer load, weather, electricity population and some other related information. It is also worth noting that the training process of these DBN networks can be parallel, which effectively shorten the processing time and provide the possible of real-time predicting.

Vehicular networks have the potential to become one of the important carriers of future mobile networks. The performance of current vehicular networks has been widely evaluated through simulation experiments due to the high cost and impracticality of other experimental approaches. The most paramount factors of vehicle networks are the authenticity of simulative evaluation, where the mobility of the vehicles is the first significant feature (i.e., the nodes of the vehicular network) that must be properly considered. However, generating the corresponding real mobility datasets has always been a big challenge although it is vital to the simulations of vehicular networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a learning-based generation method that can be used to build the vehicle-trajectory data for variety of vehicle densities.

However, these efforts were focused on close-range objects and only a very few of the deep learning-based methods were specifically designed for large-scale 3D urban reconstruction due to the lack of multi-view aerial image benchmarks. In this paper, we present a synthetic aerial dataset, called the WHU dataset, we created for MVS tasks, which, to our knowledge, is the first large-scale multi-view aerial dataset. It was generated from a highly accurate 3D digital surface model produced from thousands of real aerial images with precise camera parameters. We also introduce in this paper a novel network, called RED-Net, for wide-range depth inference, which we developed from a recurrent encoder-decoder structure to regularize cost maps across depths and a 2D fully convolutional network as framework. RED-Net's low memory requirements and high performance make it suitable for large-scale and highly accurate 3D Earth surface reconstruction. Our experiments confirmed that not only did our method exceed the current state-of-the-art MVS methods by more than 50% mean absolute error (MAE) with less memory and computational cost, but its efficiency as well. It outperformed one of the best commercial software programs based on conventional methods, improving their efficiency 16 times over.

Due to the development of deep learning, traffic accident prediction can evolve from traditional machine learning algorithms to neural networks to predict the risk of accidents in a short period of time (hour level) in the future. However, the large urban area and sparse traffic accident samples will bring difficulties to deep learning prediction.

Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457691/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The implementation of IoV is inseparable from Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. There have been many studies on packet delivery strategy in IoV, but most of all these studies ignore the links between the characteristics of the vehicle routing, road topology and communication. Therefore the performance of IoV communication is still not guaranteed. This paper proposes a packet delivery strategy based on deep reinforcement learning in IoV, which considers vehicles position, topology, the successful delivery ratio, congestion probability and the life cycle of packets. Firstly, we establish and optimize the packet delivery model. Then, based on the deep reinforcement learning method, we propose our packet delivery strategy. We also design and realize the packet delivery system in IoV with Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to obtain the real movement model of vehicles. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of our strategy compared to existing methods in packet delivery.

We collect the features of meteorology, geographical locations and PM2.5 indexes observed by air monitoring stations. Unlike the previous work, we add points of interest (POIs) feature and reduce its dimension by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model due to its sparsity and adopt wavelet decomposition to improve the inference accuracy.

In the context of urban transportation networks of growing complexity, the management of non-recurrent road traffic events, estimated to account for close to 50% of the total travel-time delay on road networks, requires advanced predictive methods, supporting both response plan deployment and traveller information. In this work, we consider the problem of predicting how a non-recurrent traffic event, such as a road incident, impacts traffic conditions at the incident location in the future. Based on a detailed statistical analysis of a large dataset of traffic incidents, we propose a parametric piecewise-affine incident model. The model is calibrated offline using a combination of constrained and unconstrained non-linear regression methods, and is shown to provide a good fit. The prediction of local incident impact is achieved via the design of a neural network model learning the parametric fit of the incident model based on available incident features. The neural network-based prediction model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art prediction methods such as multivariate decision trees. Empirical performance of the method introduced in this work is illustrated on a large dataset of more than 50000 incidents from the city of Lyon, France, for the months of September 2013 to January 2014.

10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698794,Anomalous energy detection for resource-constrained embedded systems using tracing data analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Since the multi-sensor embedded systems are spread all over the urban and suburban areas, there should be a real-time performance analysis framework to monitor the energy consumption of sensors and services. To this end, applying artificial intelligence to model the behavior can play a key role in improving operational efficiency and over-consumption detection. Most of the energy over-consumption detection approaches make use of external devices such as smart plugs or designed for smart buildings rather than computing devices. Through this paper, a new architecture is proposed in which we extract real-time execution traces after identifying the suspicious running applications using the dynamic binary instrumentation technique. The output of this step is fed to a data analytic framework to detect any behavioral anomalies such as over-threshold energy consumption. Finally, depending on the decision made by the anomaly detection step, some sensors might be switched to the standby mode in order to meet the essential expectations for other sensors or services. Since we have a resource-constrained embedded system and a real-time decision-making constraint on sensor control, the amount of computation that could be done in real-time varies a lot. Accordingly, the desired performance may dictate how, when, and where the processing operations might occur (on the embedded system or on a remote server). This work is mainly focused on anomaly detection operations using tracing data analysis.

10.1109/VTCSpring.2019.8746507,Autonomous Driving without a Burden: View from Outside with Elevated LiDAR,IEEE,Conferences,"The current autonomous driving architecture places a heavy burden in signal processing for the graphics processing units (GPUs) in the car. This directly translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla. The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud. However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body which then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit rate in the downlink and with the required latency.

It involves knowledge about the purpose of urban design, behaviors of users and needs in terms of mobility. We believe that in the near future, decision makers will have to react and more frequently adapt public policies, based on the huge amount of available data, feedbacks from both target users and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a generic agent-based architecture to model and simulate urban policies, which could facilitate the co-design and assessment of public policies in a specific environment. Two agent-based models are coupled with a micromacro dynamic loop, and they can be adapted either by the system using reinforcement learning, or by the stakeholders using simulation results. A generic formalism is elaborated to represent urban policies, which can be instantiated in a co-design approach between the policymaker and our system. An experimentation is conducted on an urban mobility policy, related to the configuration of parking price system in downtown area. The agent’s behavior and environment are developed to be as realistic as possible, based on a real-world source of modeling. However, our architecture has been designed to be generic, exploiting infrastructure data from any city using available community data (Open Street Map). The scenario of parking pricing shows that the system learns postpolicy behaviors and can propose some adjustments (e.g., specific actions to apply, when and how) to better meet the stakeholders’ objectives (e.g., maximize parking gains).

Town councils have to regularly collect different types of wastes to clean cities/towns. Hence managing the waste of the cities is a challenging task. However, most of the urban councils currently use a manual approach to managing waste. However, it results in many difficulties for the people and cleaning staff who involve in the process by following strict guidelines. Issues due to waste contamination, no proper information management of waste collection, and no punctuality in removing waste from the garbage bins are some of the significant issues arising from the manual process. Due to the drawbacks of the manual approach, social issues, environmental issues, health issues can occur easily. This paper proposes a better solution to replace this manual system with an automated system to overcome these issues. Hence, the main objective of this research is to introduce an ICT-based innovative design that can be used to develop an effective waste management system in town councils. In the proposed model, we will introduce a Computer Vision-based smart waste bin system with real-time monitoring that incorporates various technologies such as computer vision, sensor-based IoT devices, and geographical information system (GIS) related technologies. Our proposed solution consists of a waste bin system, which is capable of automated waste segregation. Our design facilitates the admin users to expand the waste bin kit by adding more waste categories in a user-friendly manner, making our product adaptive in any environment. At the same time, waste bins can notify the real-time waste status. Our system generates the optimum collection routing path and displays it in a mobile app using those real-time status details.

Due to the complexity of the urban geographic structure and the highly nonlinear temporal and spatial dependence on crowd flow, accurate forecasting becomes very challenging. Recent research works usually divided cities into regions of the same size and coded as heat-maps, for cities with complex terrain, heat-maps contain many invalid data, which have a negative effect on the acquisition of spatial dependence. In order to decrease the effect, we encode the crowd flow into graphs and propose a multi-graph neural network based model to solve the crowd flow forecasting problem. We first construct two K-NN graphs by the Euclidean distance and the Pearson correlation coefficient respectively and the spatial dependence is captured through the spatial block composed of Graph Attention Networks(GAT) and ChebNet, then another ChebNet is deployed to fuse the spatial dependency of the two graphs. Afterward, we adapted a LSTM to capture the temporal dependence of all regions separately and use self-attention mechanism and fully connected layer to (a) the receptive filed of CNN's filget prediction results.

EV charging station availability prediction is one of the traffic facilities usage forecasting challenges in the urban planning. With the accurate long-term prediction of each EV charging station availability, drivers could schedule the charging activities wisely and avoid range anxiety. Data driven models are commonly applied to deal with the similar questions. However, due to the complex charging station distribution with topological road network structure and time-variant charging station availability, many widely used algorithms, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), could only extract the pure time-series information during the model training. One direct effect is that the prediction accuracy decreases rapidly over time. The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) that consists the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) considering edge connectivity and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed to process both spatial and temporal dependence of relevant transportation data in this paper.

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82.

This paper proposes a novel concept of queue length based MFD (QMFD) considering the fact that queue length is usually regarded as an important index to evaluate the efficiency of intersections. Compared to traditional MFD, the QMFD can reflect the traffic status more intuitively and can be understood more easily by transportation managers and residents. However, the queue length of some links may not be obtained directly in real situations if no fixed detector is available. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a floating car data (FCD) based method to estimate the QMFD. Firstly, a new queue length estimation method is developed by using BP neural network with different floating car percentage. Secondly, based on the estimated queue length, QMFD is calculated by fitting the relationship between the average queue length and other macroscopic traffic parameters such as average flow at intersections. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the traffic data provided by traffic simulation software VISSIM with the real road networks of Beijing's Second Ring Road. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed queue length estimation method, and also reveal the existence of QMFD.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8483901/,2018 37th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),25-27 July 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening. The second research activity focus on developing effective and efficient computational models (in particularly, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models) to classify the image into different category of TB manifestations. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Our future work includes: (1) to further improve the performance of the algorithms, and (2) to deploy our system in the city of Carabayllo in Perú, a densely occupied urban community and high-burden TB.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545842/,"2016 IEEE First International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)",27-29 June 2016,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As a result, the urban population has to invest more time in traveling. Increased road traffic results in an increased number of road accidents and more consumption of fuel, thus wasting energy. Hence for solving this issue, this paper proposes a traffic signal synchronization system which takes real time traffic signal data as input and with the implementation of multi-agent fuzzy logic, it introduces the design of an intelligent system which would smoothen the overall road traffic of the city. Fuzzy system is capable of handling the various levels of uncertainties found in the input data taken from the traffic signals. Since fuzzy logic system needs expert knowledge for its rule base and the rule base remains unchanged once defined, this paper adds up Q-learning module so that the system learns by itself by updating the set of rule base.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7914958/,"2016 International Conference on Computing, Analytics and Security Trends (CAST)",19-21 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this way, IoT is a new paradigm, which is composed of a global network of machines and devices capable of interacting with each other [4]. IoT changes the way some real-world problems can be modeled in the cyber environment, and this is due to the ability to list device units on the network to perform small tasks, and then group the results. In this work we have designed and implemented a system whose main purpose is to assist in the process of implementing this approach, a machine learning technique known as Active Learning was used. This technique was chosen in the context of this work, due to its potential to induce predictive models from databases with the lowest number of labels. Thus, a particle swarm algorithm PSO was used on the database, which consists of a supervised learning algorithm to validate the results obtained, a second predictive model was induced, which did not use active learning for sample selection.

In this work, we describe deep convolutional neural network architectures and pre-processing steps suitable for capturing RF signals from in-flight UAVs for detection of the type of the UAV. Our objective is to leverage subtle discriminative features that may be embedded in the signal transmissions through RF fingerprinting for identifying (i) if the test signal comes from an unseen UAV (with respect to the training set), and (ii) if it is from a seen UAV, then we identify the label used during training time. Unlike static data collections, the mobile scenario is more challenging due to the rapid fluctuations in the wireless channel and Doppler effects which impair successful classification.

The network input consists of five perspective representations of the unorganized point cloud data. The network outputs an objectness map and the bounding box offset values for each point.

Now the GPS positioning technology is very mature and is developing towards high-precision and high-reliability technology. However, the stability of GPS needs to be improved. This paper uses RTK (Real Time Kinematic) real -time dynamic differential positioning technology that can improve GPS accuracy, as well as basic simple inertial navigation components such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetic compasses as GPS. Compensation during interruption improves the reliability of GPS positioning. However, the error of the long-term inertial navigation system accumulates over time, which seriously affects the navigation accuracy, and the accuracy of the simple sensor output is not high. Therefore, this paper proposes a neural network-like learning scheme that uses LSTM to achieve high-precision and reliable positioning. We use cars to collect the XY position coordinate data of the original vehicle around the urban area without difference and with difference positioning. Use MATLAB offline operation to calculate &#x03BB; (longitude), &#x03A6; (latitude) and use the data measured by integrated inertial elements to assist navigation in the road section that is shielded by GPS signals.

Currently, most autonomous vehicles rely on preconstructed lane maps as designing an algorithmic model is difficult. However, the generation and maintenance of such maps is costly and hinders large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. This paper presents the first self-supervised learning method to train a model to infer a spatially grounded lane-level road network graph based on a dense segmented representation of the road scene generated from onboard sensors. A formal road lane network model is presented and proves that any structured road scene can be represented by a directed acyclic graph of at most depth three while retaining the notion of intersection regions, and that this is the most compressed representation. The formal model is implemented by a hybrid neural and search-based model, utilizing a novel barrier function loss formulation for robust learning from partial labels.

Current research still cannot guarantee a perfect perception, and failure detections may cause collisions, leading to untrustworthy autonomous vehicles. This work proposes a trajectory planner to tolerate the detection failure of the LiDAR sensors. This method will plan the path relying on the detected objects as well as the raw sensor data. The overlapping and contradiction of both perception routes will be carefully addressed for safe and efficient driving. The object detector in this work uses a deep learning-based method, i.e., CNN-Segmentation neural network. The designed trajectory planner has multi-layers to handle the multi-resolution environment formed by different perception routes. The final system will dynamically adjust its attention to the detected objects or the point cloud to avoid collision due to detection failures. This method is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle to drive in an open urban area. The results show that when the autonomous vehicle fails to detect a surrounding object, e.g., vehicles or some undefined objects, the autonomous vehicles still can plan an efficient and safe trajectory. In the meantime, when the perception system works well, the A V will not be affected by the point clouds. This technology can make the autonomous vehicle trustworthy even with the black-box neural networks.

10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795970,License plate recognition based on temporal redundancy,IEEE,Conferences,"Recognition of vehicle license plates is an important task in several real applications. Most approaches first detect a vehicle, locate the license plate and then recognize its characters. However, the focus relies on performing these tasks using only a single frame of each vehicle in the video. Therefore, such approaches might have their recognition rates reduced due to noise present in that particular frame. Instead of selecting a single frame to perform the recognition, we propose a novel real-time approach to automatically detect the vehicle and identify (locate/recognize) its license plate based on temporal redundancy information. To achieve further improvements, we also propose two post-processing techniques by querying a license plate database. The experimental results, performed in a dataset composed of 300 on-track vehicles acquired on an urban road, demonstrate that it is possible to improve the vehicle recognition rate in 15:3 percentage points using our proposal temporal redundancy approach. Additional 7:8 percentage points are achieved by querying registered license plates on a database by the vehicle appearance, leading to a final recognition rate of 89:6%.

The model is designed to run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware, used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that ""Cells that fire together, wire together"", with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener. The model also implements plasticity, in order to deal with new or changing input over time, without catastrophically forgetting what it already learned. On top of that, it is shown that also the implementation of short-term memory plays an important role in the long-term learning properties of the model.

10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762398,MRIM: Enabling Mixed-Resolution Imaging for Low-Power Pervasive Vision Tasks,IEEE,Conferences,"While many pervasive computing applications increasingly utilize real-time context extracted from a vision sensing infrastructure, the high energy overhead of DNN-based vision sensing pipelines remains a challenge for sustainable in-the-wild deployment. One common approach to reducing such energy overheads is the capture and transmission of lower-resolution images to an edge node (where the DNN inferencing task is executed), but this results in an accuracy-vs-energy tradeoff, as the DNN inference accuracy typically degrades with a drop in resolution. In this work, we introduce MRIM, a simple but effective framework to tackle this tradeoff. Under MRIM, the vision sensor platform first executes a lightweight preprocessing step to determine the saliency of different sub-regions within a single captured image frame, and then performs a saliency-aware non-uniform downscaling of individual sub-regions to produce a &#x201C;mixed-resolution&#x201D; image. We describe two novel low-complexity algorithms that the sensor platform can use to quickly compute suitable resolution choices for different regions under different energy/accuracy constraints.

10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, an outdoor parking space vacancy detection system is proposed, using mobile devices to improve parking space searching experience for vehicle drivers by providing them with the location and occupancy information of parking spaces. The system uses state-of-the-art image recognition algorithm, namely Convolutional Neural Network with a Raspberry Pi to identify vacant parking spaces from a parking lot image retrieved in real time via an IP camera. A university parking lot has been chosen as the test bed to deploy the proposed system for real time parking space vacancy detection. An Android smartphone application called Driver App is developed to enable ubiquitous visualization of real time outdoor parking spaces occupancy information for vehicle drivers.

The potential of this technology is clear and transportation is expected to change dramatically over what is known today. The advantages of Autonomous Vehicles are pollution reduction in urban areas due to improved driving and fuel efficiency to help control traffic flow and parking problems. In addition, Autonomous Vehicles accelerate people and cargo transportation, as well as reducing human errors. There are a variety of issues in the field of Autonomous Vehicles which one of them is the issue of detecting and tracking motion objects as obstacles.

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The location category prediction, a branch of location prediction, is a vital task in a wide range of areas, including urban planning, advertising and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step Pattern-Based Embedding Model (PBEM) for predicting the next location category that user will go to. Based on the observation that some users behave frequently in a similarity pattern, a new feature termed as user cluster label is defined. In order to mine user's behavior patterns and extract the cluster label, a Category-Importance-Decay learning strategy is proposed and implemented, which provides a quantitative standard for evaluating the importance of each category. Thus, a comprehensive feature set is obtained including user, time, historical location category, text content, and user cluster label, which greatly enhances the robustness of data representation and contains more knowledge. Then the extracted feature set is fed into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a unified framework, which improves the prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of PBEM on two real-life trajectory-based check-in datasets.

Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic.

However, most of the researches are concentrated on visual appearance, they still suffer from the complicated environments in unconstrained urban/campus surveillance scenario due to unreliable visual representations with extremely challenging problems as lack of training samples, amounts of irrelevant crowds, etc. Besides, most of the existing person re-ID datasets neglect the physical truth of realistic investigation application: 1) investigators search only few suspects among amounts of crowds. Moreover, he may not go through by every camera in the surveillance area and may appear in the same camera several times; and 2) the corresponding characteristic in multi-space of the same ID can be verified with each other. Therefore, we propose a person retrieval in physical world (PRPW) dataset with large-scale unconstrained surveillance scenario.

Previous work has shown that reinforcement-learning-based control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can smooth traffic flow and improve congestion. Due to the safety and interpretability concerns around deploying AVs, we propose structured reinforcement learning policies to provide real-time guidance to human drivers to stabilize traffic. Motivated by the limitations of driver reaction times, we introduce a class of piecewise constant policies designed to be executed by human drivers to mitigate congestion. These policies are defined by a simple action space and an action extension parameter &#x0394; where each action must be held constant for &#x0394; timesteps. We prove that the optimal piecewise constant trajectory deviates in reward from the optimal trajectory by at most O(H&#x0394;) over a horizon of length H. We show that piecewise constant policies can reproduce traffic smoothing in single-lane settings for large action extension parameters (up to 14s), yielding near-optimal average velocities of above 4.2 m/s compared to 3.6 m/s by a human driver baseline. Moreover, these policies see some improvements for action extension parameters up to 24s and are robust to lane changing, indicating promise for more complex environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564789/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Current polyphonic SED systems fail to model the temporal structure of sound events explicitly and instead attempt to look at which sound events are present at each audio frame. Consequently, the event-wise detection performance is much lower than the segment-wise detection performance. In this work, we propose a joint model approach to improve the temporal localization of sound events using a multi-task learning setup.

10.1109/SNPD51163.2021.9704985,Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-time Traffic Control using QUBO,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion is one of the major issues in urban areas, particularly when traffic loads exceed the road&#x2019;s capacity, resulting in higher petrol consumption and carbon emissions as well as delays and stress for road users. In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real ""Dongda-Keyuan"" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9704985/,"2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)",24-26 Nov. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Managing these signal control systems at their optimal performance has been an important research focus in traffic engineering. However, various optimization techniques and algorithms developed for adaptive signal control are less effective for real-time implementation in non-lane following heterogeneous road traffic due to the following possible reasons: erroneous demand estimation, time-expensive computations, or uncertainty of getting optimal solutions. Rather, these models work efficiently for homogeneous lane-following traffic where demand predictions are accurate. This work proposes an optimization model that minimizes the total average control delay and finds the optimal green times without any explicit demand prediction for heterogeneous non-lane following road traffic. The proposed solution approach finds the optimal green times and the cycle time in real-time, and the obtained solutions are adaptive to traffic fluctuations.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled. The performance is close to the optimal solution yet the computational speed is 2.5 times faster.

This urban driving requires zero error tolerance. In order to guarantee safety requirements self-driving cars and the used software have to pass exhaustive tests under as many different conditions as possible.

Unfortunately, it is very time and resource intensive to record the same test set of images over and over again, every time producing, or hoping for, specific conditions; especially when using real test vehicles. This is where environment simulation comes into play. This research investigates the simulation of environmental influences which may affect the sensors used in autonomous vehicles, in particular how raindrops resting on a windshield affect cameras as they may occlude large parts of the field of view.

Wastewater management systems are conceived explicitly for purifying wastewater, providing clean water efficiently, but this is a hard task due to frequent and quite unpredictable fluctuations of inlet wastewater flows, arising from (random) rain water or (periodical, e.g. day-night) sewage sources, sometimes also leading to failures and outages. To ensure the quality of the clean water out above a threshold and keep the overall system operating, this paper proposes the smart wastewater intelligent management system (SWIMS). It monitors and controls inlet and outlet flows as well as the water quality and parts of the plant as a cyber-physical system (CPS), starting from an Environmental Internet of Things (EIoT) platform. The data generated from the treatment plant is collected in an information system hosted by a server together with an intelligent system that processes this information in a real-time fashion and provides the feedback for optimizing the plant to maintain a good quality of water over time. Such an intelligent system exploits deep learning approaches to control the behaviour of the wastewater treatment system through anomaly detection, supporting decision making on it. SWIMS has been implemented in a real case study deployed in Briatico, Italy.

Although they perform reasonably well in common scenarios, the engineering complexity renders this approach incompatible with human-level performance. On the other hand, the performance of machine-learned (ML) planning solutions can be improved by simply adding more exemplar data. However, ML methods cannot offer safety guarantees and sometimes behave unpredictably. To combat this, our approach uses a simple yet effective rule-based fallback layer that performs sanity checks on an ML planner&#x0027;s decisions (e.g. avoiding collision, assuring physical feasibility). This allows us to leverage ML to handle complex situations while still assuring the safety, reducing ML planner-only collisions by 95%.

By leveraging machine learning, biometric sensors, and advanced materials in the field and routing feedback to an intuitive augmented-reality interface, the EDNA will provide autonomous threat detection and bullet-stopping capabilities wherever those features are needed--to groups such as Police and Sheriff's Departments, Fire Departments, and EMT and emergency rescue teams. Data from the EDNA drone's sensors is fed to machine learning algorithms running on the drone in real-time. Through a neural network trained on past data, the EDNA is able to detect the presence and location of firearms and explosives, even through walls or other obstacles. Through the use of advanced metal foams and composite materials, the armored drone can even stop bullets-functionality which has obvious benefits for humanitarian deployment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8601597/,2018 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC),18-21 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/IV51971.2022.9827397,Towards Collision-Free Probabilistic Pedestrian Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Autonomous vehicle navigation in shared pedestrian environments requires the ability to predict future crowd motion as well as understand human behaviour. However, most existing methods predict pedestrian future motion without considering potential collisions within the crowd. Furthermore, most current predictive models are tested on datasets that assume full observability of the crowd by relying on a top-down view, which does not reflect the real-world use case of autonomous vehicles due to the inherent limitations of on-board sensors such as visual occlusion. Inspired by prior works, we propose a pedestrian motion prediction model trained via contrastive learning, improving prediction accuracy as well as forecasting collision-free trajectories. Additionally, we propose a method for implementing a predictor using a multi-pedestrian probabilistic tracker, which fuses multiple on-board sensors to track pedestrians in 3D space. Through comprehensive experiments on both aerial view and driving datasets collected in a real-world urban environment, we show that our proposed method improves on state of art methods with better prediction accuracy and more socially acceptable prediction trajectories.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9827397/,2022 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),4-9 June 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To have any use, the information delivery and decision making based on the data require efficient learning models together with dynamically deployed computing and network resources. The current cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures, as well as modern edge computing systems especially in the 5G and beyond networks, can be addressed to resolve these challenges. However, there are several application areas especially in vehicular and urban computing, where just harnessing more computational power does not solve computational and real-time requirements of the modern sensing systems that operate in mobile and context-dependent environments. For now, the mathematical challenges of distributed computing and real-time learning algorithms have not been profoundly addressed in the context of the IoT and real-world sensing applications. Data-driven systems also require giving full attention to information delivery, data management, data cleaning, and sensor fusion technologies that need to be equally distributed and real-time competent as the learning algorithms themselves. New software-defined computing and networking approaches and architectures are required to orchestrate the numerous connected resources dynamically, controllably, and securely along with the evolving needs.

This model aims at finding an optimal solution to reduce traffic congestion in the urban transportation system. Thus, the strategies are generated to maximize the number of vehicles passing through an intersection within a cycle time. Urban traffic is mostly controlled by signal lights, so optimum traffic management can be achieved by making strategies of the light signals according to the distribution of vehicles in the intersection. Incoming links (i.e. sections) in the intersection are regarded as players and the status of signal light (green or red) can be considered as the decisions made by players. In this way, the method is like a cooperative game combining all the decisions and evaluating a scalar cost function. Furthermore, the collision among vehicles must be taken into account while many vehicles are entering the intersection from different incoming links.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence suggest vehicle navigation by autonomous agents will be possible in the near future. In a previous paper, we proposed a reservation-based system for alleviating traffic congestion, specifically at intersections. This paper extends our prototype implementation in several ways with the aim of making it more implementable in the real world. In particular, we 1) add the ability of vehicles to turn, 2) enable them to accelerate while in the intersection, 3) give a better sensor model and communication-efficient heuristic to our driver agent, and 4) augment their interaction capabilities with a detailed protocol such that the vehicles do not need to know anything about the intersection control policy. The use of this protocol limits the interaction of the driver agent and the intersection manager to the extent that it is a reasonable approximation of reliable wireless communication. We then use this protocol to implement a new control policy: the stop sign.

Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

A 40 times reduction in manual labelling effort is achieved because the annotation of each RD map includes only the class of the objects instead of drawing a polygon around the corresponding cells. The localization of the objects is performed by tracing back from the output to the input of a classification neural network.

We believe that our approach is able to fill the gap between the two kinds of traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches by providing both agent-level implementation and system-level convergence verification. The basic idea of this approach is that agents learn not only from local environmental feedback, i.e., their own experiences and rewards, but also from other agents' experiences.

Nevertheless, in several real applications, it may be easier to detect a given event from audio information, and the use of audio surveillance systems can greatly improve the robustness and reliability of event detection. In this paper, a novel system for the detection of polyphonic urban noise is proposed for on-campus audio surveillance. The system aggregates different acoustic features to improve the classification accuracy of urban noise. A combination model composed of a capsule neural network (CapsNet) and recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. CapsNet overcomes some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as the loss of position information after max-pooling, and the RNN mainly models the temporal dependency of context information. The combination of these networks further improves the accuracy and robustness of polyphonic sound events detection. Moreover, a monitoring platform is designed to visualize noise maps and acoustic event information. The deployment architecture of the system is used in real environments, and experiments were also conducted on two public datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to existing state-of-art methods for the polyphonic sound event detection task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9592754/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, three types of safety messages are considered in urban vehicular networks, i.e., event-triggered messages for urgent condition warnings, periodic messages for vehicular status notifications, and messages for environmental perception. Roadside units are deployed for network management, and thus messages can be transmitted through either vehicle-to-infrastructure or vehicle-to-vehicle connections. To satisfy the requirements of different message transmissions, TARA framework consists of a group-level resource reservation module and a vehicle-level resource allocation module. Particularly, the resource reservation module is designed to allocate resources to support different types of message transmissions for each vehicle group at the first level. To learn the implicit relationship between the resource demand and message transmission requests, a supervised learning model is devised in the resource reservation module, where to obtain the training data we further propose a sequential resource allocation (SRA) scheme. Based on historical network information, SRA scheme offline optimizes the allocation of sensing resources, i.e., choosing vehicles to provide perception data, and communication resources. With resources reserved for each group, the vehicle-level resource allocation module is then devised to distribute specific resources for each vehicle to satisfy the differential requirements in real-time. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of TARA framework in terms of the high packet delivery ratio and low latency for message transmissions, and the high quality of collective environmental perception.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9609615/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,Aug. 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With advances network infrastructure, smart sensors, and various monitoring technologies, a standardized energy metering infrastructure, called advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), has been introduced and deployed to urban households to allow them to develop efficient power generation plans. Compared to traditional stochastic approaches for time-series data analysis, deep-learning methods have shown superior accuracy on many prediction applications. Because smart meters and infrastructure monitors produce a series of measurements over time, a large amount of data is accumulated, creating a large data stream, which takes much time from data generation to deployment of deep-learning model training. In this article, we propose an accelerated computing system that considers time-variant properties for accurate prediction of energy demand by processing the AMI stream data. The proposed system is a real-time training/inference system that deploys AMI data over a distributed edge cloud. It comprises two core components: an adaptive incremental learning solver and deep-learning acceleration with FPGA-GPU resource scheduling. An adaptive incremental learning scheme adjusts the batch/epoch in training iteration to reduce the time delay of the latest trained model, while trying to prevent biased-training due to the sub-optimal optimizer of incremental learning. In addition, a resource scheduling scheme manages various accelerator resources for accelerated deep-learning processing while minimizing the computational cost. The experimental results demonstrated that our method achieved good performance for adaptive batch size and epoch for incremental learning while guaranteeing a low inference error, a high model score, and queue stability with cost efficient processing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239387/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment. After that, the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is optimized by retraining the feature extractor for multiobject vehicle tracking. Then, we propose a real-time vehicle tracking counter for vehicles that combines the vehicle detection and vehicle tracking algorithms to realize the detection of traffic flow. Finally, the vehicle detection network and multiple-object tracking network are migrated and deployed on the edge device Jetson TX2 platform, and we verify the correctness and efficiency of our framework.

This paper proposes a machine learning approach for automatic detection of vacant lots in delimited parking spaces where the boundaries of the individual parking lots are predefined, which is then extended to a more general scenario of non-delimited parking spaces. A bag of features (bof) representation for the lots is used with a single svm classifier to discriminate between occupied and vacant lots. For non-delimited spaces, a customized background subtraction algorithm is used to generate proposal regions where vehicles can possibly be found, which are then verified using a bof plus svm approach. When tested on public datasets with images of real parking spaces, the proposed method shows robustness against large intra-class variabilities of vehicles and wide variations in vehicle pose and scale in each parking lot.

However, the volume of vehicles and traffic flows have rapidly increased. Optimizing and improving urban traffic signal control is a potential way to relieve traffic congestion. In general, traffic signal control is a sequential decision process that conforms to the characteristics of reinforcement learning, in which an agent constantly interacts with its environment, thus providing strategy for optimizing behavior in accordance with feedback in response. In this paper, we propose multiagent reinforcement learning for traffic signals (MARL4TS) to support the control and deployment of traffic signals. First, information on traffic flows and multiple intersections is formalized as input environments for performing reinforcement learning. Second, we design a new reward function to continuously select the most appropriate strategy as control during multiagent learning to track actions for traffic signals. Finally, we use a supporting tool, Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), to simulate the proposed traffic signal control process and compare it with other methods.

The knowledge acquired from radio planning of previous generations must be revisited, particularly the used path loss and antennas models, as the 5G propagation is intrinsically distinct. This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements. After calibration, the MAE for LoS and NLoS decreased to 5.45 dB and 7.51 dB, respectively. Moreover, the non-calibrated 3GPP path loss model led to overestimations of the 5G coverage and user throughput up to 25% and 163%, respectively, when compared to the calibrated model predictions. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms resulted in path loss MAEs within the range of 4.58 dB to 5.38 dB, for LoS, and within the range of 3.70 dB to 5.96 dB, for NLoS, with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm attaining the lowest error.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9486925/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the lack of labeled data and the poor generalization ability of supervised models, cross-scene classification is proposed for better utilization of the existing knowledge. Existing adaptation methods for cross-scene classification only consider the marginal distribution, while the conditional distribution is equally important in real applications. In addition, approaches based on deep learning align the distribution of features extracted from a single-scale structure, leading to the loss of information. To overcome the above drawbacks, an Attention-based Multiscale Residual Adaptation Network (AMRAN) is proposed for cross-scene classification tasks. In the proposed AMRAN, both the marginal and conditional distributions are taken into consideration for more comprehensive alignment. Besides, the attention mechanism and the multiscale strategy are used to extract more robust features and more complete information, respectively. Experimental results between four existing scene classification data sets demonstrate that AMRAN has a significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art deep adaptation methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377566/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Optimizing the control plans when severe incidents occur still remains an open problem, especially when a high number of lanes or entire intersections are affected. This paper presents a novel methodology for optimizing the traffic signal timings in signalized urban intersections, under non-recurrent traffic incidents. With the purpose of producing fast and reliable decisions, we combine the fast running Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and the reliable Genetic Algorithms (GA) into a single optimization framework. Firstly, we deploy a typical GA algorithm by considering the phase duration as the decision variable and the objective function as the total travel time in the network. We fine tune the GA for crossover, mutation, fitness calculation and obtain the optimal parameters. Secondly, we train several regression models to predict the total travel time in the studied traffic network, and select the best performing model which we further hyper-tune. Lastly, we propose a new algorithm BGA-ML combining the GA algorithm and the extreme-gradient decision-tree (XGBT), which is the best performing regression model, together in a single optimization framework. Comparison and results are generated by two experiments (one synthetic and one from real urban traffic network) and show that the new BGA-ML is much faster than the original GA algorithm and can reduce the total travel time by almost half when used under incident conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9408242/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,July 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the state-of-the-art object detection techniques designed for images captured using ground-level sensors usually experience a sharp performance drop when directly applied to remote sensing images, largely due to the object appearance differences in remote sensing images in terms of sparse texture, low contrast, arbitrary orientations, and large-scale variations. This paper presents a novel object detection network [(context-aware detection network (CAD-Net)] that exploits attention-modulated features as well as global and local contexts to address the new challenges in detecting objects from remote sensing images. The proposed CAD-Net learns global and local contexts of objects by capturing their correlations with the global scene (at scene level) and the local neighboring objects or features (at object level), respectively. In addition, it designs a spatial-and-scale-aware attention module that guides the network to focus on more informative regions and features as well as more appropriate feature scales.

To provide high-quality vehicular services with stringent delay constraints, edge computing (EC) enables resource-hungry self-driving vehicles (SDVs) to offload computation-intensive tasks to the edge servers (ESs). In addition, caching highly reusable contents decreases the redundant transmission time and improves the quality of services (QoS) of SDVs, which is envisioned as a supplement to the computation offloading. However, the high mobility and time-varying requests of SDVs make it challenging to provide reliable offloading decisions while guaranteeing the resource utilization of content caching. To this end, in this paper we propose a collaborative computation offloading and content caching method, named CoPace, by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in EC for self-driving system. Specifically, we first introduce OSTP to predict the future time-varying content popularity, taking into account the temporal-spatial attributes of requests. Moreover, a DRL-based algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the offloading and caching decisions, as well as the resource allocation (i.e., computing and communication resources) strategies.

This paper studies a practical yet important problem in those systems: how to deploy and manage their infrastructure across space and time, so that the services are <i>ubiquitous</i> to the users while <i>sustainable</i> in profitability. However, in real-world systems evaluating the performance of different deployment strategies and then finding the optimal plan is prohibitively expensive, as it is often infeasible to conduct many iterations of trial-and-error. We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation environment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility systems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the real-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the optimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the real-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search approach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative deployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a multi-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are used to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed loop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating better deployment plans in future iterations.

The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972481/,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,July 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Even with an increasing amount of both static and mobile sensing systems, an inference algorithm is still essential to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the urban atmospheric environment. Conventional physical model-based methods are unable to involve all the influencing factors with limited prior knowledge, and datadriven methods lacking physical interpretation may result in bad generalization ability. This paper presents a multi-task learning scheme, which combines the physical model and the data-driven model with both merits. It enhances the data learning of a neural network with the aid of prior knowledge on atmospheric dispersion, and also controls the impact of the knowledge with a tunable weighting coefficient. Evaluations over a real-world deployment in Foshan, China show that, with the resolution of 500m×500m×15min, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones with 7.9% error reduction and 6.2% correlation increase.

However, the flexibility of these dockless systems comes at the cost of management and operation complexity. Indeed, the imbalanced and dynamic use of bikes leads to mandatory rebalancing operations, which impose a critical need for effective bike traffic flow prediction. While efforts have been made in developing traffic flow prediction models, existing approaches lack interpretability, and thus have limited value in practical deployment. To this end, we propose an Interpretable Bike Flow Prediction (IBFP) framework, which can provide effective bike flow prediction with interpretable traffic patterns. Specifically, by dividing the urban area into regions according to flow density, we first model the spatio-temporal bike flows between regions with graph regularized sparse representation, where graph Laplacian is used as a smooth operator to preserve the commonalities of the periodic data structure. Then, we extract traffic patterns from bike flows using subspace clustering with sparse representation to construct interpretable base matrices. Moreover, the bike flows can be predicted with the interpretable base matrices and learned parameters. Finally, experimental results on real-world data show the advantages of the IBFP method for flow prediction in dockless bike sharing systems. In addition, the interpretability of our flow pattern exploitation is further illustrated through a case study where IBFP provides valuable insights into bike flow analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9069440/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Feb. 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, few work has been dedicated to depict and analyze these structures, mainly due to the lack of effective models. In this paper, we propose to model the crowd mobility as a dynamical system and characterize the irregular mobility data with a novel local coherence of sparse field (LCSF) algorithm. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to measure the separation behavior of trajectories in an irregular and sparse topology network. Detected HMS, referred as local separation measure of LCSF, divides the geographical urban areas into distinct functional regions over time.

In this paper, we propose a novel online framework that could learn from the current traffic situation (or context) in real-time and predict the future traffic by matching the current situation to the most effective prediction model trained using historical data. As real-time traffic arrives, the traffic context space is adaptively partitioned in order to efficiently estimate the effectiveness of each base predictor in different situations. We obtain and prove both short-term and long-term performance guarantees (bounds) for our online algorithm. The proposed algorithm also works effectively in scenarios where the true labels (i.e., realized traffic) are missing or become available with delay.

Pedestrian crossing intention should be recognized in real-time, especially for urban driving. Recent works have shown the potential of using vision-based deep neural network models for this task.

The key to shared bus implementation lies in accurately predicting travel requirements and planning dynamic routes. However, the sparseness and the high volatility of shared bus data bring a great resistance to accurate prediction of travel requirements. Based on the consideration of user experiences, optimization objectives of shared bus route planning are significantly different from traditional public transportation and shared bus route planning is far more challenging than online car-hailing services due to the relatively high number of passengers. In this paper, we put forward a two-stage approach (SubBus), which is composed of travel requirement prediction and dynamic routes planning, based on various crowdsourced shared bus data to generate dynamic routes for shared buses in the &#x201C;last mile&#x201D; scene. First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the &#x201C;last mile&#x201D; scene. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;This paper is inspired by the problem of shared subway shuttle bus dynamic route planning for the &#x201C;last mile&#x201D; scene, and it is also applicable to other scenes, including commuting scenes, urban transportation hub scenes, and destination scenes of the tourist market.

10.1109/TITS.2019.2935152,T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction,IEEE,Journals,"Accurate and real-time traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent traffic system and is of great significance for urban traffic planning, traffic management, and traffic control. However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an “open” scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets. Our tensorflow implementation of the T-GCN is available at https://www.github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809901/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, through analyzing the quantitative relationship between passengers' getting on and off taxis, we propose a time-location-relationship (TLR) combined taxi service recommendation model to improve taxi drivers' profits, uncover the knowledge of human mobility patterns, and enhance passengers' travel experience. Moreover, the TLR model uses Gaussian process regression and statistical approaches to acquire passenger volume, mean trip distance, and average trip time in functional regions during every period on weekdays and weekends, and allows drivers to pick up more passengers within a short time frame. Finally, we compare our proposed model with the autoregressive integrated moving average model, the back-propagation neural network model, the support vector machine model, and the gradient boost decision tree model by using the real taxi GPS data in Beijing. The experimental results show that our optimizing taxi service recommendation can predict more accurately than others by considering the 3-D properties.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7880635/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,June 2017,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845339,Using Social Media for Attendees Density Estimation in City-Scale Events,IEEE,Journals,"City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, and limited mean errors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374412/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/TMECH.2021.3079409,Valve Detection for Autonomous Water Pipeline Inspection Platform,IEEE,Journals,"Water distribution and transmission lines are indispensable to urban infrastructure. The water pipelines are subject to both structural and functional deterioration due to various reasons including aging, negligence, and high demand for water supply. Hence, to ensure a safe and reliable water supply, the water utilities need to perform routine pipe condition assessment. The condition assessment is usually carried out by visual inspection with the machine vision system carried by a robotic platform. The inspection platforms will capture the internal condition of the water pipelines in a video stream. However, the robotic platform frequently experiences difficulties while traversing through the valves installed along the pipeline. This inhibits and disrupts the inspection process of the water pipelines. Therefore, this article proposes a deep learning-based automatic valve detection framework to facilitate the robot&#x2019;s navigation and ensure continuous inspection without any interruptions. The valve detection model is developed by combining MobileNet-160 and Feature Pyramid Network and is named as MFPN. The developed framework also employs a generative adversarial network to solve the sparse dataset issues and improve the generality of the framework. The comparative study and ablation analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve a higher mAP value of 89.11&#x0025; in comparison with the state of the art. Hence, this light weight and efficient solution can be deployed to the robotic platform for real-time valve detection and enable autonomous navigation of the robotic platform for condition assessment of water pipelines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9429956/,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,April 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, there is still a range of areas in an urban city that cannot be covered by satellites, e.g., large-scale tunnels, underground parking lots, and multilevel flyovers. Current vehicle inertial tracking methods always rely on dead-reckoning, but their performances are seriously affected by intrinsic fluctuations and external disturbances. Based on our experiments with thousands of smartphones, we summarize three threats for vehicle inertial tracking, i.e., arbitrary and unknown placements of smartphones during driving, volatile and inconstant noises on low-quality inertial sensors in commodity smartphones, and a diversity of smartphones and vehicles via crowdsensing. In this article, we explore a novel smartphone-based inertial learning framework to infer a vehicle’s location in real time. It contains a coordinate transformation algorithm to yield vehicle’s movements from smartphone’s inertial readings, an inertial sequence learning model to train and infer the trajectory instead of double integrations, and a customized model refinement mechanism to improve the tracking accuracy for individual drivers. Extensive experiments on the DiDi ride-hailing platform in two large cities have proved the effectiveness of our solution. In addition, our approach has been deployed on DiDi real-world mobile applications in 7.59 million devices and conducted 4.26 billion location inferences every day.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9729184/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3142898,WH-MAVS: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Multiple Land Use and Land Cover Applications,IEEE,Journals,"Over the past decade, many excellent data sharing efforts have enriched the remote sensing scene classification (SC) methods. These datasets have achieved great success in complex high-level semantic information interpretation. However, most existing datasets are collected from standard and ungeoreferenced image patches for algorithm training and evaluation. These datasets do not fit for practical applications and cannot be directly applied in further geographical study. Accordingly, we provide a large range high-resolution SC dataset with multiple time phases, called “Wuhan Multiapplication VHR Scene classification dataset (WH-MAVS).” It facilitates the study of SC and scene change detection (SCD) algorithms. Moreover, it can also be directly employed to perform a variety of real-life land use application tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first free, publicly available, georeferenced, and annotated dataset to cover almost an entire megacity. The WH-MAVS was collected and annotated from Google Earth imagery with the same spatial resolution and uniform nonoverlapping patch size, covering the central area of Wuhan, China. The total number of scene samples is 47 137, which belong to 14 classes with 23 567 labeled patches for each time phase in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The geographic coordinates of all samples in both time phases exhibit one-to-one correspondence with 23 202 unchanged image patches of scene categories and 365 changed ones. The distribution of the number of samples in each class is highly imbalanced; moreover, there are large intraclass differences and indistinguishable interclass variances. These characteristics are closer to the real land use/land cover application tasks and introduce further challenges to the related algorithm research. In addition, we conducted benchmark experiments on SC and SCD based on the WH-MAVS dataset with widely used deep learning models. DenseNet169 was found to achieve the best performance. The overall accuracies are 91.07% and 92.09%, respectively, in the 2014 and 2016 validation sets of WH-MAVS. Furthermore, SCD obtained by DenseNet169 has a binary change detection accuracy of 89.56% and a multiple (from–to) change detection accuracy of 86.70%.

The results show that the predicted value is consistent with the real value, especially when the attenuation fluctuation is not significant, but it understates cumulative rainfall when rain sharply increases.

The large spectral variability of man-made structures, as well as the mixed pixel phenomenon, imposes the use of computational demanding techniques, which are not always effective for real case applications. Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, which are mainly used for classification and regression analysis. Specifically, a support vector classifier (SVC) constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which separates the training data into different classes. These are then used to classify a whole image, or series of images. The current standard SVM algorithm for classification used by the most popular mapping software (e.g., ENVI, EnMAP) is the C-SVC. The parameterization of a C-SVC strongly affects the final classification result. Yet, there is no rule of thumb to choose the optimal parameters when classifying satellite imagery. Optimal parameterization totally depends on the training data, and to determine it for a specific case, a time-consuming trial-and-error process is inevitable. In this work, advancements for the C-SVC algorithm are proposed to enhance its performance when used to classify remote sensing data, eliminating the need for a part of manual parametrization, while ensuring increasing its performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9180087/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,May 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.26599/TST.2021.9010026,Collaborative city digital twin for the COVID-19 pandemic: A federated learning solution,TUP,Journals,"The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has caused a crisis that affects all segments of the population. As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9409764/,Tsinghua Science and Technology,Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TITS.2020.3030252,Context-Aware Taxi Dispatching at City-Scale Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Proactive taxi dispatching is of great importance to balance taxi demand-supply gaps among different locations in a city. Recent advances primarily rely on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to directly learn the optimal dispatching policy. These works, however, are still not sufficiently efficient because they overlook several pieces of valuable context information. As a result, they may generate quite a few improper actions and introduce unnecessary coordination costs. To improve existing works, we present COX – a context-aware taxi dispatching approach that incorporates rich contexts into DRL modeling for more efficient taxi reallocations. Specifically, rather than simply dividing the service area into grids, COX proposes a road connectivity aware clustering algorithm to divide the road network graph into zones for practical taxi dispatching. In addition, COX comprehensively analyzes zone-level taxi demands and supplies through accurate taxi demand prediction and timely updates of taxi statuses. COX improves the DRL modeling by integrating these derived contexts, e.g., state representation with complete demand/supply data and sequential action generation with full coordination among idle taxis. In particular, we implement an environment simulator to train and evaluate COX using a large real-world taxi dataset. Extensive experiments show that COX outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various performance metrics, e.g., on average improving the total order values by 6.74%, while reducing the number of unserved taxi orders and passengers’ waiting time by 4.92% and 44.84%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9247444/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,March 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Feature tracking being a core part of SfM and MVS, is essential for multiview scene modeling and perception, but difficult to evaluate in large scale datasets due to the lack of sufficient ground-truth. For large-scale aerial imagery, accurate camera orientation and dense 3D point cloud accuracy can be used to assess the impact of accurate feature localization and track length. We propose a novel view simulation (or synthesis) framework which generates visually realistic new unseen camera views for feature detection using known high fidelity camera poses for modeling. Seven state-of-the-art local handcrafted and learning-based features are quantitatively evaluated for robustness and matchability within the SfM and MVS pipelines using the open source COLMAP software. Our experimental results provide performance rankings of each feature, using twelve different evaluation metrics across three synthetic city-wide aerial image sequences. We show that recent learned features, SuperPoint and LF-Net, have not only reached the quality of the best handcrafted features like SIFT and SURF, but now outperform them in terms of more accurate 3D camera pose estimates and longer feature tracks. SuperPoint produces 1.51 meter average position error and 0.03° average angular error, while SIFT remains competitive (second best for pose and overall) with 1.78 meter and 0.11° errors respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9284524/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"15 May15, 2021",ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is common to observe emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire engines obstructed by traffic snarls on Indian roads, especially in the proximity of busy intersections. Existing literature primarily advocates the deployment of RFID technology to terminate the round-robin sequence of the signal system and switch the signal to green in the required direction. However, this technology has proven to be susceptible to electromagnetic interferences and also the economic feasibility is questionable. This paper proposes a model that employs real time image processing and object detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SSD Mobilenet. Unlike a few other architectures, SSD Mobilenet requires very limited computation, hence enabling swift detection. Furthermore, an acoustic signal (sound) processing (pitch detection) algorithm is employed to detect the sirens of emergency vehicles to nullify the potential false positives (e.g. an ambulance in a non-emergency scenario) that creep into object detection using image processing. Both algorithms work in unison, bolstering the accuracy of detection. Upon detection, the signal instantly switches to green, facilitating the expedited movement of emergency vehicles, even in high traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9074933/,2020 2nd International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA),5-7 March 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the first phase of the model, meteorological variables optimal to the response (here rainfall) are selected with the optimal lag value of the response variable. A dynamic variable selection method named, time series least angle regression (TS-LARS) is applied in this phase. In the second phase, an ensemble comprising artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed. The number of hidden neurons in each ANN are selected randomly to speed up the training of the ensemble. The optimization of each ANN is done by Levenberg Marquart Gradient Descent method. In the third phase of the ensemble, the component ANN models are ranked based on mutual information (MI) between the outputs of the base models and the original output. Before applying MI, we have used independent component analysis (ICA) to extract the base models which are independent with each other. Finally the highest ranked base models are combined to construct the ensemble model. A real world case study has been setup in Fukuoka city, Japan. Daily rainfall data from 1990 to 2010 with relevant meteorological variables are extracted to construct the data.

Traditional traveling information service systems, such as car navigation systems or web maps, only provide relatively static information which doesn't truly reflect the dynamic changes of traffic situation, and result in very limited practical use. Although there have emerged some car navigation products and other applications involving dynamic traffic information, considering the rapid change of city traffic situation, these applications still face practical difficulties for all the information received real-timely will get outdated within a few minutes, which makes the so called dynamic applications basically time-slice limited static ones. Aiming at such a problem, a short-term traffic prediction approach and a consequent real-time route guidance process are presented in this paper which integrates historical traffic based statistical reasoning, real-time traffic and events processing, with a BP neural network based analytical model, to forecast the situation and evaluate the influence of traffic during the traveling process.

Air quality prediction information is one of the better ways through which people can be informed to be more vigilant about serious health issues and protect human health caused by air pollution. In many metropolitan cities air pollution is a major challenging environmental issue. To analyze the present traffic condition of the city, local authorities can be enabled by real time monitoring of pollution data which makes appropriate decisions.

10.1109/CyberC.2010.83,An Ambient Service Model for Providing Structured Web Information Based on User-Contexts,IEEE,Conferences,"Users often visit many stores while they compare merchandise in order to purchase the merchandise or merchandise related to it. Given a service providing information such as location of these stores, they can reduce their time and effort spent by wandering around them because they can go straight to these stores. And they can obtain new purchase opportunities because they can know what kinds of related stores are around them. Thus, they can do efficient purchasing activities. In this paper, we discuss service providing information of related stores efficiently in order to support users' efficient purchasing activities. And we propose an ambient service model that consists of three layers: structured (purchase-related) information space, real-life space, and ambient information space. In this model, a lot of store information collected from the web is grouped and structured automatically by relation in terms of purchasing. And users search information of related stores by using an ambient query that is automatically created by their context in real-life space. Finally, they obtain information of related stores in the form of hierarchy structure through map interface. Then, they can search other kinds of information of related stores additionally by using the hierarchy structure. We implemented a system based on this model by using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), map-based, location-based and ontology technology.

10.1109/SNPD.2008.90,An Approach to Modeling Software Safety,IEEE,Conferences,"Software for safety-critical systems must deal with the hazards identified by safety analysis in order to make the system safe, risk-free and fail-safe. Software safety is a composite of many factors. Existing software quality models like McCall's and Boehm's and ISO 9126 are inadequate in addressing the software safety issues of real time safety-critical embedded systems. At present there does not exist any standard framework that comprehensively addresses the factors, criteria and metrics (FCM) approach of the quality models in respect of software safety. This paper proposes a new framework for software safety based on the McCall's software quality model that specifically identifies the criteria corresponding to software safety in safety critical applications. The criteria in the proposed software safety model pertains to system hazard analysis, completeness of requirements, identification of software-related safety- critical requirements, safety-constraints based design, runtime issues management, and software safety-critical testing. This framework is then applied to a prototype safety-critical system viz. a software-based road traffic control system (RTCS) commonly used in city traffic, to validate its utility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4617469/,"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing",6-8 Aug. 2008,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/HASE.2012.33,An Autonomic Reliability Improvement System for Cyber-Physical Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"System reliability is a fundamental requirement of cyber-physical systems. Unreliable systems can lead to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. Typical cyber-physical systems are designed to process large amounts of data, employ software as a system component, run online continuously and retain an operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirements for safety-critical systems. This paper describes a data-centric runtime monitoring system named ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System) for improving the reliability of these types of cyber-physical systems. ARIS employs automated online evaluation, working in parallel with the cyber-physical system to continuously conduct automated evaluation at multiple stages in the system workflow and provide real-time feedback for reliability improvement. This approach enables effective evaluation of data from cyber-physical systems. For example, abnormal input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop, who can then take actions and make changes to the system based on these alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system reliability. We have implemented ARIS in a large commercial building cyber-physical system in New York City, and our experiment has shown that it is effective and efficient in improving building system reliability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6375637/,2012 IEEE 14th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering,25-27 Oct. 2012,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although the proposed models have been remarkably improved in recent years, there are still questions that need to be answered before deploying models. For example, it is difficult to figure out which models provide state-of-the-art performance, as recently proposed models have often been evaluated with different datasets and experiment environments. It is also difficult to determine which models would work when traffic conditions change abruptly (e.g., rush hour). In this work, we conduct two experiments to answer the two questions. In the first experiment, we conduct an experiment with the state-of-the-art models and the identical public datasets to compare model performance under a consistent experiment environment. We then extract a set of temporal regions in the datasets, whose speeds change abruptly and use these regions to explore model performance with difficult intervals. The experiment results indicate that Graph-WaveNet and GMAN show better performance in general. We also find that prediction models tend to have varying performances with data and intervals, which calls for in-depth analysis of models on difficult intervals for real-world deployment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9458663/,2021 IEEE 37th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),19-22 April 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the potential for replacing manual workers, the study of pick-up robot is attracting much interest. Pick-up robots usually work in fixed working areas where the types of coals and gangues are unitary. Based on this fact, this paper proposes a simple, fast, and easily implemented approach for coal and gangue classification which is LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) based using gray scale and texture as features. We firstly sampled the image dataset from Han City, Shaanxi province and Jizhong, Hebei province which are two main mining areas in China. The data of Han City consists of the images of lean coal and shale, and the data of Jizhong is coking coal and sandstone. By analyzing the gray scale and the texture of the sampled data, we discover that coal and gangue vary in the parameters including the mean and peak of gray scale, contrast ratio, and entropy. Therefore, these four parameters are chosen as features. We utilize LS-SVM as the machine learning model, and the model is trained with three groups of parameters separately. The first are the mean and peak of gray scale, the second are the contrast ratio and entropy which represents texture features, and the third are the peak of gray scale and the contrast ratio which integrates gray scale and texture features. After evaluation by using our sampled dataset, the model trained by the third group outperforms others. The classification results were 98.7% correct of coal and 96.6% correct of gangue for the data of Han city, and 98.6% correct of coal and 96.6% correct of gangue for the data of Jizhong.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621725/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR),1-5 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we present three research contributions of IoE. First, we describe a software architecture to support the deployment of mobile and smart services over an Electric Mobility (EM) scenario. The proposed architecture relies on an ontology-based data representation, on a shared repository of information (Service Information Broker), and on software modules (called Knowledge Processors -KPs) for standardized data access/management. As a result, information sharing among the different stakeholders of the EM scenario (i.e. EVs, EVSEs, City Services, etc) is enabled, and the interoperability of smart services offered by heterogeneous providers is guaranteed by the common ontology. Second, we rely on the proposed architecture to develop a remote charging reservation system, that runs on top of mobile smarthphones, and allows drivers to monitor the current state-of-charge of their EV, and to reserve a charging slot at a specific EVSE. Finally, we validate our architecture through a benchmark framework, that supports the embedding of mobile EV applications and of real KPs into a simulated vehicular scenario, including realistic traffic, wireless communication and battery models.

Research and development in the area of ATSC have produced a number of new systems with promising potential, however the performance of these systems under real-life conditions has been always a concern for practitioners as well as researchers, particularly if and how the new systems would be implementable in the field on controllers with specific capabilities and limitations. Therefore, testing and refining new ATSC systems on actual hardware and under representative traffic conditions prior to field implementation is essential to bridge this gap. In this paper, a hardware in-the-loop simulation (HILS) framework is developed to evaluate MARLIN, as an example of a new self-learning ATSC system. HILS is used for evaluating hardware components running the ATSC software in a simulation environment in which an actual traffic signal controller and an embedded computer are physically connected to a microscopic traffic simulator. Our focus is on the development, implementation of the HILS framework and the evaluation of MARLIN, on an intersection that suffers significant traffic fluctuation and delays - at the City of Burlington, Ontario, Canada. The performance of MARLIN-ATSC is demonstrated with HILS, which consists of a PEEK ATC-1000 traffic controller, an embedded computer running the ATSC system, and Paramics microscopic simulation model.

Businesses have already started to use Big Data Analytics, particularly predictive and prescriptive analytics, to strengthen and increase their business yields. Not only has analytics resulted in business growth, but has also provided a significant competitive edge over others. The voluminous data generated from various resources is highly unstructured in nature and adding a structure to it would leverage the actual potential of the data. New techniques and frameworks should serve as human aids in automatically and intelligently analyzing large datasets in order to acquire useful information. In this paper, we attempt to perform Big Data Analytics on data from one of the most important and growing sources, namely, Telecommunication. To keep pace with the growing telecommunication market and ever increasing demands of the consumers for quality service, the telecom service providers are required to observe and estimate various trends in customer's usage to plan future upgrades and deployments driven by real data.

While deep reinforcement learning has shown success in solving these perception and decision-making problems in an end-to-end manner, these algorithms require large amounts of experience to learn navigation policies from high-dimensional data, which is generally impractical for real robots due to sample complexity. In this paper, we address these problems with two main contributions. We first leverage place recognition and deep learning techniques combined with goal destination feedback to generate compact, bimodal image representations that can then be used to effectively learn control policies from a small amount of experience. Second, we present an interactive framework, CityLearn, that enables for the first time training and deployment of navigation algorithms across city-sized, realistic environments with extreme visual appearance changes. CityLearn features more than 10 benchmark datasets, often used in visual place recognition and autonomous driving research, including over 100 recorded traversals across 60 cities around the world.

The most difficulty in CPGS development is the lack of parking lots data. Without these data, the traditional well-designed parking guidance algorithms will fail. Meanwhile, the real-time location information of automobiles is increasing and can be accessed easily thanks to the popularity of smartphone and smart vehicular devices. In this paper, we propose a new idea of guiding automobiles to proper parking lots by using the data collected from the vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) device. Then we build a spatial-temporal classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with long-short term memory (LSTM) to learn the parking experience from the automobiles uploading the parking locations. Finally, we use the classifier to recommend the proper parking lots nearby to vehicles, considering the related driving context. The experiment shows the proposed method can guide automobiles to the target parking lots accurately even if we do not know the real-time data of the target parking lots. Moreover, the classifier shows the obvious spatial characteristics and preference for the first time when guiding vehicles. This method is a kind of crowdsourcing and encourages automobiles to share their parking experience, to help park easier for themselves eventually.

A three-layer (input, hidden and output) ANN having appropriate number of nodes in each layer and with the Ward architecture was constructed which uses three activation functions (Gaussian, Gaussian complement, and hyperbolic tangent) in the hidden layer. The model was validated using the k-fold cross-validation procedure. The results, that is, daily minimum and maximum temperature, were obtained using the R software package (4.0.3 version).

Therefore, LoRa plays a more and more important role in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), which easily extend many large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications in diverse scenarios (e.g., industry, agriculture, city). In lots of environments where various types of land-covers usually exist, it is challenging to precisely predict a LoRa link's path loss. As a result, how to deploy LoRa gateways to ensure reliable coverage and develop precise fingerprint-based localization becomes a difficult issue in practice. In this paper, we propose DeepLoRa, a deep learning-based approach to accurately estimate the path loss of long-distance links in complex environments.

10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005655,Detecting Pedestrian Crossing Events in Large Video Data from Traffic Monitoring Cameras,IEEE,Conferences,"Pedestrian safety on the road is a priority for transportation system managers and operators. While there are a number of treatments and technologies to effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these are most needed remains a challenge. Mid-block locations, where safety countermeasures are often needed the most, are typically harder to monitor. Current practice often requires manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to an identification process that is often time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern changes over time, and lacks scalability. As a result, target locations are often selected reactively, after serious traffic incidents reveal an underlying safety issue. We propose an approach to use data collected by existing traffic monitoring cameras to automatically identify pedestrian activities on the road. We propose an algorithm to detect pedestrian crossing events based on the detection of individuals on individual video frames using a deep neural network model. Resulting pedestrian locations and movement trajectories can be visualized on a background image, which is automatically extracted at the analyzed location from the video. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach with a real-world use case. The case study considered in this work uses cameras owned by the City of Austin, Texas to study pedestrian road use before and after the deployment of a pedestrian-hybrid beacon. We explore qualitative and quantitative metrics to describe pedestrian activity and corresponding changes, which may be used to prioritize the deployment of pedestrian safety solutions, or evaluate their performance. We compared the number of crossing events detected per hour with manually reviewed results from a selected day. The result shows 67 percent overall accuracy, although we observe significant variability across times-of-day. Despite observed limitations, our work illustrates how the value of existing traffic camera networks can be augmented beyond everyday traffic monitoring, and used to collect valuable information on road usage by pedestrians.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005655/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),9-12 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For given incident information and user's living area, PRISM first computes severity of the incident, based on distance, time, and type of the incident. It then visualizes the incidents with the severity on a heat map. Thus, PRISM provides real-time personalized information adapted to individual situation of users.

Making an appropriate layoff plan is always quite difficult since a bad job cutting has a serious impact on not only the organization but also the business process executing efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of making an optimal layoff plan with the least influence on the executing of the business process. The key challenge is estimating the process throughput under a layoff plan. We overcome this challenge by two steps: regressing the activity throughput by the stuff number and inferring process throughput by the maximum flow or minimum cut algorithm on the Directed Acyclic Graph of process. In the regressing step, a kernel autoregressive hybrid model is proposed, whose MSE is 30% lower than SVM. After that, an augmenting path based algorithm is introduced to make an optimal layoff plan.

10.1109/SASO.2014.22,Estimating p-Values for Deviation Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"Deviation detection is important for self-monitoring systems. To perform deviation detection well requires methods that, given only ""normal"" data from a distribution of unknown parametric form, can produce a reliable statistic for rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e. evidence for devating data. One measure of the strength of this evidence based on the data is the p-value, but few deviation detection methods utilize p-value estimation. We compare three methods that can be used to produce p-values: one class support vector machine (OCSVM), conformal anomaly detection (CAD), and a simple ""most central pattern"" (MCP) algorithm. The SVM and the CAD method should be able to handle a distribution of any shape. The methods are evaluated on synthetic data sets to test and illustrate their strengths and weaknesses, and on data from a real life self-monitoring scenario with a city bus fleet in normal traffic. The OCSVM has a Gaussian kernel for the synthetic data and a Hellinger kernel for the empirical data. The MCP method uses the Mahalanobis metric for the synthetic data and the Hellinger metric for the empirical data. The CAD uses the same metrics as the MCP method and has a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) non-conformity measure for both sets. The conclusion is that all three methods give reasonable, and quite similar, results on the real life data set but that they have clear strengths and weaknesses on the synthetic data sets. The MCP algorithm is quick and accurate when the ""normal"" data distribution is unimodal and symmetric (with the chosen metric) but not otherwise. The OCSVM is a bit cumbersome to use to create (quantized) p-values but is accurate and reliable when the data distribution is multimodal and asymmetric. The CAD is also accurate for multimodal and asymmetric distributions. The experiment on the vehicle data illustrate how algorithms like these can be used in a self-monitoring system that uses a fleet of vehicles to conduct deviation detection without supervision and without prior knowledge about what is being monitored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7001005/,2014 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems,8-12 Sept. 2014,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Solar energy is one of the RES that has gained worldwide acceptability because it is cheap and available. However, solar power is characteristically unpredictable. Accurate prediction of global solar radiation (GSR) continues to be a great need both in the field of physical simulations and artificial intelligence. Both statistical and machine learning methods have proved to be very useful, but researchers are still working on algorithms that can give the least possible error. In this paper, four deep learning algorithms were used to successfully to estimate GSR. Historical meteorological data for Johannesburg city were used as the dataset. The dataset was split into training and testing data. Results obtained showed that Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) with nRMSE value of 1.62% performed better than the other models.

Edge computing devices offer a promising tool for recording turning movement data if lightweight algorithms can be designed to run in real-time with relatively modest computational complexity. To that end, this work presents Vehicle Turning-Movement Counting using Localization-based Tracking (LBT-Count). This method is fast because it never performs detection on a full frame. Instead, only a few portions of the image are cropped and used to detect objects within the frame. The method achieves competitive performance on the public evaluation server for Track 1 of the AI City Challenge (7th overall on the first 50% of data).

Software Defined Network (SDN) enabled EC architecture is emerging as a potential solution that enables dynamic bandwidth allocation and task scheduling for latency sensitive and diverse mobile applications in the EC environment. This study proposes a novel Heuristic Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based flow-level dynamic bandwidth allocation framework and validates it through end-to-end implementation using OpenFlow meter feature. OpenFlow meter provides granular control and allows demand-based flow management to meet the diverse QoS requirements germane to IoT traffics.

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions. The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies in the encoded air pollutant data for PM2.5 concentration forecasting.

However, when the road network of the city is very complicated and dense, which is usually the case, it will take too long for the algorithm to find the shortest path. Furthermore, in reality, things are not as simple as those stated in network theory. For instance, the cost of travel for the same part of the city at different times may not be the same. In this project, we have integrated Dijkstra's algorithm with a knowledge-based approach and case-based reasoning in solving the problem.

Multiple devices equipped with acoustic sensors are deployed to collect the audio information. A learning-based approach is introduced to address the difficulties of accurately classifying the temporally overlapping acoustic events in a noisy environment. Then, edge computing is adopted to handle the high processing complexity of the learned analytics. Computation-intensive tasks of classification and localization can be offloaded to the nearby edge server for low-latency sound detection. An ensemble-based cooperative decision-making algorithm is also presented to aggregate the information from distributed devices in order to obtain better classification results. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of edge computing which helps reduce the time latency as well as the superiority of cooperative post-processing on the edge server to obtain a high accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8711202/,2018 IEEE 37th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC),17-19 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139223,Location utility-based map reduction,IEEE,Conferences,"Maps used for navigation often include a database of location descriptions for place recognition (loop closing), which permits bounded-error performance. A standard pose-graph SLAM system adds a new entry for every new pose into the location database, which grows linearly and unbounded in time and thus becomes unsustainable. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new map-reduction approach that pre-constructs a fixed-size place-recognition database amenable to the limited storage and processing resources of the vehicle by exploiting the high-level structure of the environment as well as the vehicle motion. In particular, we introduce the concept of location utility - which encapsulates the visitation probability of a location and its spatial distribution relative to nearby locations in the database - as a measure of the value of potential loop-closure events to occur at that location. While finding the optimal reduced location database is NP-hard, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm to sort all the locations in a map based on their relative utility without access to sensor measurements or the vehicle trajectory. This enables pre-determination of a generic, limited-size place-recognition database containing the N best locations in the environment. To validate the proposed approach, we develop an open-source street-map simulator using real city-map data and show that an accurate map (pose-graph) can be attained even when using a place-recognition database with only 1% of the entries of the corresponding full database.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7139223/,2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),26-30 May 2015,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Integrated with mobile crowdsourcing (MCS), radio map can be updated by mobile users in a low-cost manner. However, the crowdsourced measurement data may get quite sparse, and contain noises and errors. Therefore, how to efficiently infer missing data under low-quality measurements is critical in crowdsourced radio map construction. Existing inference methods like matrix completion require certain strict conditions, e.g. missing at completely random (MACR), which is impractical in the city-scale sensing. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning scheme based on adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) to handle measurements with large missing regions and complicated loss patterns. Specifically, this scheme applies variational auto-encoder (VAE) to infer missing data, and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the VAE to improve recovery quality. Comprehensive experiments on three real datasets show that the proposed scheme can outperform state-of-the-art methods under large missing rates and low-quality measurements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9417253/,2021 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC),29 March-1 April 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00088,Mobility-Aware Dynamic Taxi Ridesharing,IEEE,Conferences,"Taxi ridesharing becomes promising and attractive because of the wide availability of taxis in a city and tremendous benefits of ridesharing, e.g., alleviating traffic congestion and reducing energy consumption. Existing taxi ridesharing schemes, however, are not efficient and practical, due to they simply match ride requests and taxis based on partial trip information and omit the offline passengers, who hail a taxi at roadside with no explicit requests to the system. In this paper, we consider the mobility-aware taxi ridesharing problem, and present mT- Share to address these limitations. mT-Share fully exploits the mobility information of ride requests and taxis to achieve efficient indexing of taxis/requests and better passenger-taxi matching, while still satisfying the constraints on passengers' deadlines and taxis' capacities. Specifically, mT-Share indexes taxis and ride requests with both geographical information and travel directions, and supports the shortest path based routing and probabilistic routing to serve both online and offline ride requests. Extensive experiments with a large real-world taxi dataset demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of mT-Share, which can response each ride request in milliseconds and with a moderate detour cost.

Most existing approaches achieve good performance on clean benchmark datasets recorded in well-controlled environments. However, detecting anomalies is much more challenging in the real world. Adverse weather conditions like rain or changing brightness levels cause a significant shift in the input data distribution, which in turn can lead to the detector model incorrectly reporting high anomaly scores. Additionally, surveillance cameras are usually deployed in evolving environments such as a city street of which the appearance changes over time because of seasonal changes or roadworks. The anomaly detection model will need to be updated periodically to deal with these issues. In this paper, we introduce a multi-branch model that is equipped with a trainable preprocessing step and multiple identical branches for detecting anomalies during day and night as well as in sunny and rainy conditions. We experimentally validate our approach on a distorted version of the Avenue dataset and provide qualitative results on real-world surveillance camera data.

Effective processing and analysing tweets in real time can help city organisations gain situational awareness of the affected citizens and take timely operations. With the advances in deep learning techniques, recent studies have significantly improved the performance in classifying crisis-related tweets. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human, but can lead to model's misclassification.

In contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could enable many impactful applications from robotics to user personalization. Most few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the real-world. To close this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark, grounded in the real-world application of teachable object recognizers for people who are blind/low-vision. The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486 objects recorded by people who are blind/low-vision on their mobile phones.

In recent years, large amounts of data are rapidly being stored in the cloud system, and effective data utilization for solving real-world problems is required more than ever. Hierarchical Data Analysis and Optimization System (HDAOS) enables us to select appropriate algorithms according to the degree of difficulty in solving problems and a given time for the decision-making process, and such selection helps address real-world problems. In the field of emergency evacuation planning, however, the Lexicographically Quickest Flow (LQF) algorithm has an extremely long computation time on a large-scale network, and is therefore not a practical solution. For Osaka city, which is the second-largest city in Japan, we must solve the maximum flow problems on a large-scale network with over 8.3M nodes and 32.8M arcs for obtaining an optimal plan. Consequently, we can feed back nothing to make an evacuation plan. To solve the problem, we utilize the optimal solution as training data of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We train a CNN by using the results of the LQF algorithm in normal time, and in emergencies predict the evacuation completion time (ECT) immediately by the well-learned CNN. Our approach provides almost precise ECT, achieving an average regression error of about 2%. We provide several techniques for combining LQF with CNN and addressing numerous movements as CNN's input, which has rarely been considered in previous studies. Hodge decomposition also demonstrates that LQF is efficient from the standpoint of the total distance traveled by all evacuees, which reinforces the validity of the method of utilizing the LQF algorithm for deep learning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8258322/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),11-14 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/EDGE.2018.00028,Real-Time Traffic Pattern Collection and Analysis Model for Intelligent Traffic Intersection,IEEE,Conferences,"The traffic congestion hits most big cities in the world - threatening long delays and serious reductions in air quality. City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions.

The rescuing efforts of Lake Tana so far focused on removal of the weed by hand and using harvesting machines. With the weed invasion doubling every two weeks, the current approaches will not be able to control the rapid invasion of the weed, which is causing considerable socioeconomic losses. The proposed system architecture employs networked underwater robots, aerial drones and other environmental sensors for better mapping of the weed coverage in real-time, predicting the floating paths of the weed, and learning the favourable environmental conditions of the lake for eradicating the invasive weed.

In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has made it possible for smart car navigation instead of the manual consultation. Not only that, smart cars can even handle short-distance goods transportation. Combining indoor positioning technology with different video signals or any other non-GPS satellite positioning technology for directing the smart car to the designated position is a hot research direction these days. In this paper, we mainly study the realization and application of a smart car in the indoor automated driving system.

In the early stage of PGS deployment, however, it is very hard to collect the real-time data from the parking lots all over the city, considering the financial and time cost. So how could PGS try to keep the prediction on parking occupancy working well under the environment lacking realtime data?

The state of the art techniques for travel time estimation use GPS traces to learn the weights of a road network, often modeled as a directed graph, then apply Dijkstra-like algorithms to find shortest paths. Travel time is then computed as the sum of edge weights on the returned path. In order to enable time-dependency, existing systems compute multiple weighted graphs corresponding to different time windows. These graphs are often optimized offline before they are deployed into production routing engines, causing a serious engineering overhead. In this paper, we present STAD, a system that adjusts - on the fly - travel time estimates for any trip request expressed in the form of origin, destination, and departure time. STAD uses machine learning and sparse trips data to learn the imperfections of any basic routing engine, before it turns it into a full-fledged time-dependent system capable of adjusting travel times to real traffic conditions in a city. STAD leverages the spatio-temporal properties of traffic by combining spatial features such as departing and destination geographic zones with temporal features such as departing time and day to significantly improve the travel time estimates of the basic routing engine. Experiments on real trip datasets from Doha, New York City, and Porto show a reduction in median absolute errors of 14% in the first two cities and 29% in the latter.

SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that can create a digital representation (twin) of a smart space and its activities. SmartSPEC uses a semantic model and ML-based approaches to characterize and learn attributes in a sensorized space, and applies an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor datasets, etc). To evaluate the realism of the data generated by SmartSPEC, we develop a structured methodology and metrics to assess various aspects of smart space datasets, including trajectories of people and occupancy of spaces.

However, centralized processing of massive video from thousands of cameras in a city is very costly and causes serious problems of privacy protection.

To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-optimizing Memory Network model, namely SoMem, which runs person Re-ID on edge devices in a totally unsupervised and distributed way. Specifically, SoMem adopts a random walk based collaborative training procedure to optimize the visual model on each camera based on locally collected images, and builds a distributed memory network to memorize and match the observed persons by using a distributed mutual ranking algorithm. Based on the cross-camera person matching results learned by the memory network, the visual models on edge devices are further optimized in a self-organized manner. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several real person Re-ID datasets and deployed on edge devices to show the effectiveness and efficiency of this novel distributed Re-ID model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9288284/,2020 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI),9-11 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ICDE53745.2022.00202,Spatial-Temporal Interval Aware Sequential POI Recommendation,IEEE,Conferences,"The past flourishing years of sequential point-of-interest (POI) recommendation began with the introduction of Self-Attention Network (SAN), which quickly superseded CNN or RNN as the state-of-the-art backbone. To realize the fine-grained users&#x0027; behavior patterns modeling, recent works utilize modified attention mechanisms or neural network layers to process spatial-temporal factors. However, due to the significant increase on either model&#x0027;s parameter scale or computational burden, we argue that these methods can be further improved. In this paper, we exploit two lightweight approaches, Time Aware Position Encoder (TAPE) and Interval Aware Attention Block (IAAB), to impel SAN by considering the spatial-temporal intervals among POIs separately, where requiring neither extra parameters nor high computational cost. On the one hand, TAPE, adjusting the positions in sequences based on the timestamps dynamically and generating positional representations with sinusoidal transformation, can enhance sequence representations to reflect both the absolute order and relative temporal proximity among all POIs. On the other hand, IAAB, point-wise adding the scaled spatial-temporal intervals to the attention map, can promote the attention mechanism attaching importance to the spatial relation among all POIs under the constraints of time conditions and providing more explainable recommendation. We integrate these two modules into SAN and propose a Spatial-Temporal Interval-Aware sequential POI recommender, namely STiSAN, as an end-to-end deployment. Experimental results based on three public LBSN datasets and one real-world city transportation dataset demonstrate STiSAN&#x0027;s superior performance (average 13.01&#x0025; improvement against the strongest baseline).

The TSP solution with Hopfield networks is based on the uniqueness constraint. This is, each city must be visited once and only once while trying to minimize the travelling distance. But in real world applications, usually there are other equally important constraints needing to be considered. For example, an ordering constraint on how cities are to be visited. This paper proposes a modified Hopfield neural network architecture that can solve a new class of optimization problem, called ""the picking stone problem (PSP)"". The PSP requires not only the uniqueness but also the ordering constraints. The neural network implementation to solve PSP tends to turn on neurons which satisfy the ordering constraint and this constraint is essential in solving the stereo correspondence problem in binocular vision and can be applied to many other pattern recognition problems. In this paper the authors define the PSP, formulate its computational complexity, propose the ordering-oriented neural network architecture, discuss the performance of the proposed network by the traditional random initialization method, and propose a new initialization method to improve the performance of the network.<>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/375034/,Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94),28 June-2 July 1994,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Vehicle counting, in particular, has become a key element of vision-based intelligent traffic systems deployed across metropolitan areas. Most methods solved the vehicle counting problem under the assumption of state-of-the-art computing systems. However, large-scale deployment of such systems for multi-camera processing is very inefficient. With the recent advancement of cost-efficient Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices alongside machine learning methods developed specifically for such devices, solving the vehicle counting problem for real-time traffic analysis on IoT edge devices, and thereby facilitating its large-scale deployment have become highly favorable. In this paper, we propose a framework of vehicle counting designed specifically for IoT edge computers which follows the detection-tracking-counting (DTC) model.

However, representing human behaviour in this dynamic environment is not a trivial task and such models require an accurate representation of pedestrian behaviour. Virtual environments have been gaining notoriety as a behaviour elicitation tool, but it is still necessary to understand the validity of this technique in the context of pedestrian studies, as well as to create guidelines for its use. This work proposes a proper methodology for pedestrian behaviour elicitation using virtual reality environments in conjunction with surveys or questionnaires. The methodology focuses on gathering data about the subject, the context, and the action taken, as well as on analyzing the collected data to finally output a behavioural model. The resulting model can be used as a feedback signal to improve environment conditions for experiment iterations. A concrete implementation was built based on this methodology, serving as an example for future studies.

The subjects controlled a virtual avatar using an HTC Vive and were asked to traverse the distance between two points in a city.

The rise of violent behavior in public areas can be attributed to a variety of factors. Greed, frustration, and hostility among individuals, as well as social and economic anxieties, are the primary causes of increased violence. It is critical to protect our possessions, as well as our lives, from threats such as robbery or homicide. It is impossible to prevent crime and violent acts unless brain signals are studied and a certain pattern deduced from criminal ideas is detected in real-time. Due to its technological viability, it has yet to be realized. However, We can identify violent activity in public spaces by using the concepts of computer vision (a subfield of deep learning) technology. The goal of this project is to build a real-time violent activity monitoring system that will be capable of detecting violence very quickly and efficiently. The public of any city can benefit from it, as it will allow the people of the law enforcement department to take necessary actions to prevent violent activities.

A wireless sensor network-based approach to detect car positions,IEEE,Conferences,"The global trend of increased urbanization makes space rare in city environments in general and for parking in particular. In addition, cars become bigger and often use more than one parking space. As a result neighboring parking spaces can be affected by a parked car. So, a basically free parking space might be too narrow for an arriving car depending on the arriving car's size. Therefore, means to detect car positions on parking spaces in a fine granular way are required to detect such situations and avoid inefficient parking space searches. Wireless sensor networks provide the possibility to sense the exact occupation of a parking space and potential influences on neighboring parking spaces. However, current solutions focus only on the detection if a parking space is occupied or not.

Similar to the reasoning of human intuition, the final outcome of a complex black-box procedure is verified against given expectations of an object's behavior. In this article, we apply and evaluate collaborative, sensor-generic plausibility checking as a mean to detect empirical perception faults from their statistical fingerprints. Our real use case is next-generation automated driving that uses a roadside sensor infrastructure for perception augmentation, represented here by test scenarios at a German highway and a city intersection.

However, the heterogeneity of multiagent data, the volatility of components, and the real-time analysis requirement in EI bring significant challenges. To solve these problems, in this article we propose a stream processing framework based on linked data for information collaboration among multiple energy networks. The framework provides a universal data representation based on linked data and semantic relation discovery approach to model and semantically fuse heterogeneous data. Semantics-based information transmission contracts and channels are automatically generated to adapt to structural changes in EI.

The bad air environment seriously damages the physical and mental health of the people. The change in smog concentration will be affected by many realistic factors and exhibit nonlinear characteristics. The method proposed in this paper is to use the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the acquired data, process the data, and predict the next data using a neural network. The existing prediction models have limitations. They don't accurately capture the law between the concentration of haze and the factors affecting reality. It is difficult to accurately predict the nonlinear smog data. One algorithm proposed in this paper is a two-layer model prediction algorithm based on Long Short Term Memory Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit (LSTM&GRU). We set a double-layer Recurrent Neural Network to predict the PM2.5 value. This model is an improvement and enhancement of the existing prediction method Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The experiment integrates data monitored by the IoT node and information released by the national environmental protection department. First, the data of 96 consecutive hours in four cities were selected as the experimental samples. The experimental results are close to the true value. Then, we selected daily smog data from 2014/1/1 to 2018/1/1 as a train and test dataset. It contains smog data for 74 city sites.

Typically, tourists have different kinds of preferences about their itineraries, limited time budgets, unfamiliar with the wide range of Points-of-Interest (POIs) in a city, so that planning an itinerary is quite tedious, time-consuming, and challenging for them. In this paper, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm for personalized itinerary planning for travelers to plan their itineraries better. Firstly, desired starting POIs (e.g., POIs that are close to their hotels) and destination POIs (e.g., POIs that are near train stations or airports) are considered in our approach. Secondly, we also take some general factors into account that travelers would consider in their preferences of an itinerary, which are mandatory POIs, the total number of POIs, the overall POI popularity, the overall cost, and the overall rating. Thirdly, we view this kind of recommendation task as a Multi-Objective Optimization problem, and we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm with the crossover and mutation probabilities (AGAM) for solving this problem to better find the best global solution. Fourthly, we allocate different weights to every factor which considered in our paper to generate a personalized itinerary recommendation for better meet many kinds of preferences of tourists. Finally, we compare our approach against baselines on real-world datasets which include six touristic cities, and the experimental results show that the AGAM achieves better recommendation performance in terms of the mandatory POIs, total POI visits, overall POI popularity, total travel time (including travel time and visit duration), overall cost, and overall rating.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9082176/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The large scale deployment of pedelecs, however, requires a careful design of maintenance system to replace the batteries regularly that can be costly.

First, we develop an optimal and efficient hybrid prediction model which predicts the usage demand of pedelecs in every 48 h on a scale of millions of pedelecs. Our proposal predicts the future usage increment of pedelecs by combining a local predictor, a global predictor, and an inflection predictor, which captures both the short-term and long-term factors affecting the pedelec usage. Second, based on the developed predictor and results of big data analytics, an optimal path planning scheme for the replenishment of pedelec batteries is developed.

In recent years, the adoption of surveillance cameras is rapidly growing because they are helpful to manage and control the traffic. However, it is impossible to install cameras on every road in a city due to the high costs of deployment and maintenance. Given the information from limited surveillance cameras, can we infer the citywide traffic volume accurately? This is a challenging question because we have no historical data on the roads without cameras. It requires us to design a method that goes beyond the inference using nearby traffic data. Moreover, a nice property of surveillance camera data is that these AI-equipped cameras can recognize individual vehicles. So we can recover incomplete trajectories for vehicles using plate numbers in surveillance camera records. However, for road segments without cameras, we do not know whether those vehicles pass through them or not. How can such incomplete trajectories be effectively used to help citywide traffic inference? In this paper, we propose a framework named CityVolInf to infer citywide traffic volume based on surveillance camera records. Our framework combines a semi-supervised learning-based similarity module with a novel simulation module to address the above challenges. While the similarity module focuses on spatiotemporal correlations of traffic volume between road segments, the simulation module utilizes incomplete trajectories to model transitions of traffic volume between adjacent road segments. Our framework bridges the conventional data-driven approach and transportation domain knowledge from the simulator. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, containing 405,370,631 camera records collected from 1,704 surveillance cameras over a period of 31 days in Jinan, China.

Thanks to the high penetration of smartphones, social media users are increasingly going mobile. This trend has contributed to foster various location based services deployed on social media, the success of which heavily depends on the availability and accuracy of users' location information. However, only a very small fraction of tweets in Twitter are geo-tagged. Therefore, it is necessary to infer locations for tweets in order to attain the purpose of those location based services. In this paper, we tackle this problem by scrutinizing Twitter user timelines in a novel fashion. First of all, we split each user's tweet timeline temporally into a number of clusters, each tending to imply a distinct location. Subsequently, we adapt two machine learning models to our setting and design classifiers that classify each tweet cluster into one of the pre-defined location classes at the city level. The Bayes based model focuses on the information gain of words with location implications in the user-generated contents. The convolutional LSTM model treats user-generated contents and their associated locations as sequences and employs bidirectional LSTM and convolution operation to make location inferences.

For ride-hailing service providers, it is necessary to supervise the demands of customers so that they could carry out reasonable dispatches. To achieve it, a number of data mining methods have been applied. But most of these predicting methods only consider this problem from the temporal aspect, neglecting the connection inter and intra blocks of the city. Blocks are the outputs of region partition, which divides the whole city into a series of divisions. At the same time, the partitioned map, specifying borders of blocks, is useful for platforms to improve the process of supervising, dispatching, and recommending. However, the majority of current partition methods is static and cannot effectively utilize features extracted from historical and geographical operational data.

There is an extensive literature addressing the problem of computing landslide susceptibility maps (which is a classification problem exploiting a large range of static features) and only few on actual short terms predictions (spatial and temporal).

The introduction of explainable artificial intelligence techniques allowed to understand global and local feature relevance. In order to find the best prediction model, some machine learning solutions have been implemented and assessed. The obtained models overcome the ones available in literature.

Time and road risk index (RRI) are considered as metrics to be balanced based on user preference. To evaluate road segment risk, a road and accident database from the highway safety information system is mined with a hybrid neural network model to predict RRI. Real-time factors such as time of day, day of the week, and weather are included as correction factors to the static RRI prediction. With real-time RRI and expected travel time, route planning is formulated as a multiobjective network flow problem and further reduced to a mixed-integer programming problem. A V2C2V implementation of our safety-based route planning approach is proposed to facilitate access to real-time information and computing resources. A real-world case study, route planning through the city of Columbus, Ohio, is presented.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976433,Short-Term Parking Demand Prediction Method Based on Variable Prediction Interval,IEEE,Journals,"With the rapid economic development, parking problems have become increasingly prominent due to the city's development model and the emergence of a large number of private cars. Parking management departments around the world focus on intelligent parking system in order to solve parking problems, but most of them are limited to upgrading the parking infrastructure. There is no effective solution from a perspective of the fundamental cause to solve the parking problem. At present, it is generally believed that parking guidance systems can effectively alleviate parking problems and provide drivers and traffic managers with real-time and accurate parking information. As one of the prerequisites of the parking guidance system, the accuracy of the short-term parking demand prediction method determines whether the implementation of the parking guidance scheme can effectively solve the parking problem in a certain area. Based on this, we have studied a short-term parking demand prediction in this paper. First, focusing on the distribution of typical parking arrivals and departures regular pattern, a parking demand prediction model was constructed utilizing the Markov birth and death process, and model parameters were calibrated utilizing curve fitting method and undetermined coefficients method. The simulation environment was set up utilizing the Markov process to verify the accuracy of the availability of parameter estimation method. Secondly, a method for determining the prediction interval based on the parking trend was given for different situations with the parking rush hours and ordinary hours which parking arrival and departure parameters were different. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model in practical applications, parking arrival and departure data from June 17 to June 23, 2019 in Jilin University of Nanling Campus was used to verify the short-term parking demand prediction method proposed in this paper. The results show that the parking demand prediction model proposed in this paper can accurately calibrate model parameters, predict parking demand quickly and effectively and provide theoretical reference and technical support for parking planning and management.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9016013/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This architecture is based on a directed acyclic graph architecture (similar to the IOTA tangle) and uses both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Position mechanisms to provide protection against spam attacks and malevolent actors. In addition to enabling individuals to retain ownership of their data and to monetize it, the architecture is also suitable for distributed privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, is lightweight, and can be implemented in simple internet-of-things (IoT) devices. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this framework to reinforcement learning settings where a third party is interested in acquiring information from agents. In particular, one may be interested in sampling an unknown vehicular traffic flow in a city, using a DLT-type architecture and without perturbing the density, with the idea of realizing a set of virtual tokens as surrogates of real vehicles to explore geographical areas of interest. These tokens, whose authenticated position determines write access to the ledger, are thus used to emulate the probing actions of commanded (real) vehicles on a given planned route by “jumping” from a passing-by vehicle to another to complete the planned trajectory. Consequently, the environment stays unaffected (i.e., the autonomy of participating vehicles is not influenced by the algorithm), regardless of the number of emitted tokens.

Our work is motivated by the observed limitations of utilizing traditional data sources (e.g., social media data and survey data) that commonly suffer from the limited coverage of tourist population and unpredictable information delay. <i>TourSense</i> demonstrates how the transport data can overcome these limitations and provide better insights for different stakeholders, typically including tour agencies, transport operators, and tourists themselves. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based iterative propagation learning algorithm to recognize tourists from public commuters. Taking advantage of the trace data from the identified tourists, we then design a tourist preference analytics model to learn and predict their next tour, where an interactive user interface is implemented to ease the information access and gain the insights from the analytics results. Experiments with real-world datasets (from over 5.1 million commuters and their 462 million trips) show the promise and effectiveness of the proposed framework: the Macro and Micro F1 scores of the tourist identification system achieve 0.8549 and 0.7154, respectively, whereas the tourist preference analytics system improves the baselines by at least 23.53 and 11.44 percent in terms of precision and recall.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8620274/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This is rarely the case regarding control-related problems, as for instance controlling traffic signals, where the state space can be very large. One way to deal with the curse of dimensionality is to use generalization techniques such as function approximation. In this paper, a linear function approximation is used by traffic signal agents in a network of signalized intersections. Specifically, a true online SARSA<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(\lambda)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> algorithm with Fourier basis functions (TOS(<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lambda $ </tex-math></inline-formula>)-FB) is employed.

10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441582,A Real-Time Deep Transfer Learning Model for Facial Mask Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rise of COVID-19, wearing masks in public areas has become paramount to preventing the transmission of the coronavirus, Furthermore, many public service providers may require customers to properly wear masks in order to be served. But current enforcement measures of mask mandates are mostly monitored by humans, and thus may be hard to execute effectively in densely populated and fast-moving venues like airports and public transit. An automated mask detection monitoring system could greatly reduce the required human labor. In this study, a facial mask detection software model, usable in existing surveillance applications such as airport monitoring systems, is developed using Keras, a high-level deep learning API, and TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The model uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which were trained from a database of roughly 12,000 images of faces, with roughly a 50-50 split of masked and unmasked, with the goal of achieving binary classification to detect whether a person is wearing a mask. The DCNN mask detection software achieved a validation accuracy of 98 percent. We also used computer vision techniques from OpenCV including facial detection and contours to detect the location of the people’s faces. The DCNN was then paired with this application to achieve live feed object detection by first detecting a person, and then determine whether they are wearing a mask. Finally, we explore the potential implementation and applications of the facial detection model via the linkage of cameras in monitoring areas to signal and notify officials.As more countries are developing mask wearing regulations, automated masked face detection is a key real-world application [3]. Transportation systems are one area that have been considerably affected by the pandemic, as cities around the world had to enforce massive restrictions on public transport in order to limit transmission of the virus and ensure the safe passage of key workers during the emergency response [4]. Masks have since been required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, transportation hubs such as airports and stations [5].However, Machine Learning and Deep Learning can help to combat Covid-19 in many ways. Enabling researchers and clinicians to evaluate a vast amount of data to make various predictions. In particular, face mask detection may prove to be useful as a guide for government surveillance on people in public areas susceptible to transmission, to ensure that face mask regulations are upheld. To achieve this, deep learning binary classification facial mask model based on VGG19 and one-shot object detection methods will be trained.We contribute a dual face-and-mask detection system that can provide immediate feedback in live surveillance systems.

Train rescheduling is such a problem in plan revision. In this kind of problem, the AI system's output can not be used without human acceptance. And a person such as the train dispatcher has to be responsible for the acceptance of the output. Further, situations dynamically change in real-time. Thus, the central problem here is to let him quickly grasp and accept the AI system's suggestions. Focussing on such problems, this paper presents an AI coordination technique especially for plan revision consisting of: a flexible and hierarchical representation mechanism for goal decomposition and its alternative attainment knowledge, for solving complex problems through divide and conquer; dynamic goal generation, goal prioritizing, and its concurrent achievement through preemption, for solving dynamic problems; a fine-grained goal coordination mechanism for a real time complex system; and a man-machine coordination mechanism for quick user acceptance (rule-type knowledge representation for encapsulating multiple suggestions such as for proposing alternative suggestions together and/or for proposing subordinate suggestions together to solve side effects).

These global models and their assumptions are at odds with evidence that the relationship between crime and criminogenic factors is not homogeneous across space. In response to this gap, we present area-specific crime prediction models based on hierarchical and multi-task statistical learning.

Moreover, enhanced network capabilities facilitate enabling of IoV technology for latency-critical applications in energy-constrained smart IoT devices. However, IoV networks demand energy efficiency due to its dynamic nature for which Roadside Units (RSUs) are critical. However, in cities, huge deployment of RSUs and their maintenance is expensive in IoV infrastructure, requiring a trade-off between the network coverage and installation-related expenses. Also, the latency issues in IoV are highly dependent on the positioning of accessible RSUs. Motivated by the above highlighted issues, we propose an upgraded RSU placement method to boost network efficiency through placement of RSUs in optimal locations in a given road map. The Memetic Framework-based Optimal RSU Deployment (MFRD) algorithm is proposed to maximize the coverage area among the vehicles in an IoV and minimize the overlap in the coverage of the different RSUs.

As a result, unmanned water vehicles are deployed to clean up the water pollution. Most of these vehicles are manually controlled to determine whether the water plants are algae or landscape. A computer vision-based auto system will be helpful to alleviate the overload labor inefficiency. In this work, we conducted a series of experiments using transfer learning with three SOTA deep neural networks (VGG16, ResNet50, and Vision Transformer), to examine their classification performances on two types of identification standards, three water plant species and plant species in the near or far distance. In addition, we also examined the performance with data augmentation. Our result suggests that: (1) Vision Transformer overperforms in both classification tasks; (2) plant species standard works the best that leaves the result for augmentation in different times still varies depending on choices of other factors. Thus, our work contributes to three aspects: 1) Provide an inhouse dataset collected in the real-world small water bodies. 2) Provide model selection guidance by comparing three SOTA deep networks performances. 3) Apply vision transformer at the first time to the algae classification task and the benchmark enables the potential to extend the backbone model to downstream tasks, such as algae detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9647123/,2021 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Frontiers Technology of Information and Computer (ICFTIC),12-14 Nov. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of designing PRN is to provide as rich information as possible for each single layer. During the training phase, we propose to propagate gradient combinations rather than feature combinations. PRN can be easily applied in many existing network architectures, such as ResNet, feature pyramid network, etc., and can effectively improve their performance. Nowadays, more advanced DCNs are designed with the hierarchical semantic information of multiple layers, so the model will continue to deepen and expand. Due to the neat design of PRN, it can benefit all models, especially for lightweight models. In the MSCOCO object detection experiments, YOLO-v3-PRN maintains the same accuracy as YOLO-v3 with a 55% reduction of parameters and 35% reduction of computation, while increasing the speed of execution by twice. For lightweight models, YOLO-v3-tiny-PRN maintains the same accuracy under the condition of 37% less parameters and 38% less computation than YOLO-v3-tiny and increases the frame rate by up to 12 fps on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform. The Pelee-PRN is 6.7% mAP@0.5 higher than Pelee, which achieves the state-of-the-art lightweight object detection.

The detection of the Bangla number plates from different cities and multi-class vehicles is the first step of the proposed system. The number plate detection has been performed with the computer vision approach, and the You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3) algorithm. Next, the Tesseract optical character recognition system, in conjunction with the Bangla character recognition model, has been used for vehicle indexing and convolutional neural network for the character recognition from the detected number plate. Numerical results demonstrate that the accuracies of license plate detection for the computer vision and YOLOv3 are 91% and 95%, respectively. For the character recognition, the accuracy for Tesseract and convolutional neural network are 90% if the license plate is detected and cropped successfully and 91.38%, respectively. Finally, our system has been tested using the convolutional neural network method in an environment of real-world where our system&#x0027;s Pi Camera captured video as input, which has a total of 18 different cars. From 18 cars, it has successfully detected 17 cars, which makes our overall system accuracy 88.89%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9257843/,2020 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET),26-27 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Natural ventilation is often a viable option for diluting indoor air pollutants, but transportation noise transmission is a crucial ecological conflict. Therefore, personal control over the concentration of outdoor/indoor air pollutants and noise levels is a significant threshold for natural ventilation availability. This study proposes real-time data detection and notification solutions using sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve indoor air quality and outdoor air quality and outdoor noise transmission. An intelligent real-time detection and notification system was implemented in a distributed computing framework with cloud and edge computing.

However, real-time anomaly detection remains a challenge. Internet of Things (IoT) is an effective platform for real-time monitoring of large-scale solar farms. Using low-cost edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi (RPI), it is possible to not only read power and irradiance values from in-situ sensors, but to also apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms for real-time analysis and for detecting anomalous behaviors. This paper presents the design and implementation of an edge analytics application that uses RPI as an edge device. The Isolation Forest algorithm was first used to detect shading anomalies. A Siamese neural network was then trained to create a latent-space mapping. An anomaly detection model based on the latent space and a neural network and kNN was developed. These models could detect shading anomalies with an F1-Score of 0.94. Embedded variants of the model based on TensorFlow Lite and TensorRT were evaluated to service a large number of solar panels at 1Hz.

The problems are the k-shortest time path problems with any combination of three constraints: time, hop, and label constraints, and the graphs can be directed, undirected, or bidirected with symmetric and/or asymmetric traversal time, which can be real and time dependent. Isomorphic to the graph where the SP is to be sought, the network is activated by generating autowave at source neuron and the autowave travels automatically along the paths with the speed of a hop in an iteration. Properties of the network are studied, algorithms are presented, and computation complexity is analyzed. The framework guarantees globally optimal solutions of a series of problems during the iteration process of the network, which provides insight into why even the SP is still too long to be satisfied. The network facilitates very large scale integrated circuit implementation and adapt to very large scale problems due to its massively parallel processing and minimum resource utilization. When implemented in a sequentially processing computer, experiments on synthetic graphs, road maps of cities of the USA, and vehicle routing with time windows indicate that the MRNN is especially efficient for large scale sparse graphs and even dense graphs with some constraints, e.g., the CPU time taken and the iteration number used for the road maps of cities of the USA is even less than ~2% and 0.5% that of the Dijkstra's algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6709796/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Aug. 2014,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the license-plate recognition is especially difficult under poor image resolutions. In this vein, super-resolution (SR) can be an inexpensive solution, via software, to overcome this limitation. Consecutive frames in a video may contain different information that could be integrated into a single image, richer in details. In this paper, we design and develop a novel, free and open-source framework underpinned by SR and automatic license-plate recognition (ALPR) techniques to identify license-plate characters in low-quality real-world traffic videos, captured by cameras not designed specifically for the ALPR task, aiding forensic analysts in understanding an event of interest. The framework handles the necessary conditions to identify a target license plate, using a novel methodology to locate, track, align, super-resolve, and recognize its alphanumerics. The user receives as outputs the rectified and super-resolved license-plate, richer in detail, and also the sequence of license-plates characters that have been automatically recognized in the super-resolved image. Additionally, we also design and develop a novel SR method that projects the license-plates separately onto the rectified grid, and then fill in the missing pixels using inpainting techniques. We compare the different algorithms in the framework (five for tracking, three for registration, seven for reconstruction, two for post-processing, and two for the recognition step), and present discussions on the pros and cons of each choice. Our experiments show that SR can indeed increase the number of correctly recognized characters posing the framework as an important step toward providing forensic experts and practitioners with a solution for the license-plate recognition problem under difficult acquisition conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016340/,IEEE Access,2017,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

So far, a large number of scheduling algorithms have been developed to reduce energy consumption for executing workflows. However, most existing algorithms have obvious defects in energy and resource efficiency, because they schedule workflow tasks to hosts directly and ignore that the host is so powerful that a single workflow task cannot make full use of its resources. To resolve the issue, a new scheduling architecture is designed for cloud data centers. Then, two principles are derived: one suggests that hybrid scheduling tasks from different workflows is helpful for improving resource utilization; the other one deduces that balancing host weighted square frequencies can minimize total power consumption of active hosts under a given resource requirement. On the basis of the scheduling architecture and the two principles, an oNline schEduling AlgoriThm, namely NEAT, is proposed to schedule dynamic workflows with deadlines. Furthermore, three strategies for dynamically adjusting the available virtual machines (VMs) and active hosts are proposed and integrated into NEAT to improve the energy and resource efficiency for cloud data centers.

Under this light, positioning services that harvest location fingerprinting based on received signal strength indications (RSSIs) are widely popular due to the massive data generation that IoT settings provide. However, the labor-intensive and repetitive task of the radio map construction through offline RSSI fingerprint collection prevents such services from becoming standard equipment for future smart facilities. In this paper, we present a location-aware infrastructure that combines a broad sensing layer, edge computing, and centralized cloud federation support.

In this paper, we reveal a new accelerometer-based side-channel attack which is particularly serious: malware on smartphones can easily exploit the accelerometers to trace metro riders stealthily. We first address the challenge to automatically filter out metro-related data from a mass of miscellaneous accelerometer readings, and then propose a basic attack which leverages an ensemble interval classifier built from supervised learning to infer the riding trajectory of the user. As the supervised learning requires the attacker to collect labeled training data for each station interval, this attack confronts the scalability problem in big cities with a huge metro network. We thus further present an improved attack using semi-supervised learning, which only requires the attacker to collect labeled data for a very small number of distinctive station intervals. We conduct real experiments on a large self-built dataset, which contains more than 120 h of data collected from six metro lines of three major cities.

This work proposes a mobility vertical federated forecasting (MVFF) framework that allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over vertically partitioned data belonging to multiple organizations. MVFF enables the forecasting of mobility predictions covering a joint location domain. We evaluate MVFF&#x0027;s performance over two real-world datasets using different spatial and temporal neural network algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the two datasets&#x0027; mean percentage error performance gains are up to 12&#x0025; and 4&#x0025; compared to the state-of-the-art, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9842629/,"2022 IEEE 46th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",27 June-1 July 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICCCN.2019.8847117,A User-Centric Mobility Management Scheme for High-Density Fog Computing Deployments,IEEE,Conferences,"The inherent mobility characterizing users in fog computing environments along with the limited wireless range of their serving fog nodes (FNs) drives the need for designing efficient mobility management (MM) mechanisms. This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios. This is shown through significant improvements in the cumulative regret as well as the instantaneous delay, compared to the case where all newly-appeared FNs are explored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8847117/,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),29 July-1 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In order to advanced provision resources, we need to predict the mobility patterns of the consumers so that this can be done in an efficient fashion. To predict the mobility pattern of the user equipment's (UE's) one tends to fit a single ML/AI model and deploy it in the network. In real life, there can be more than one underlying pattern in the data and a single model need not be necessarily generalizable. Also, in some cases, the underlying mobility pattern may change with time which is known as concept drift. If the distribution change is beyond a threshold, it is better to retrain the model to generalize it for the new set of data and it is a costly exercise. However, in the case of multiple models, the problem is complex, and confusion arises on which model to retrain when the concept drift is detected. In this work, we propose a new method to handle concept drift in the multiple model scenario and further advise which model to retrain once the concept drift is detected. This mechanism can be used to generate accurate results without costly retraining on the model multiple times even when the underlying distribution changes rapidly.

The government performed recovery activities pursuant to their own road-recovery plan to help damaged citizens' lives return to their original condition as soon as possible. However, it took a week after the disaster to begin to restoration of neighborhood roads. Therefore, optimal decision-making systems are necessary to improve resiliency related to real life. We adopt an off-policy algorithm of a single-agent deep Q-learning approach, because disaster situations differ based on the occurrence area, and a generalized solution for optimal decision making does not exist. To develop a decision-making system that accounts for human mobility, we utilized origin-destination pairs extracted from the location data of smartphones and, digital road maps reproduced from real topologies. Agent in our model is the entrance point of the O-D pairs passing through a damaged road section on normal days. Each agent is assigned tendency to decide actions according to the road type, and a weight factor depending on the extent of damage. In addition, a restoration rate, which refers to the score of the action, is calculated based on the delayed travel time according to the changed demand of the trip. Restoration rate is affected by the agent's action, and gives the environment information related to the answer signals. This helped us to ascertain that it takes a longer time for origin-destination pairs using a road section with heavy traffic to recover to their original state. We estimated the number of required steps of each O-D's mobility until they get their own restoration rate over than 0.85.

The challenge is aggravated by the fact that there does not exist a method to optimize key inter-frequency handover parameters namely A5 time-to-trigger, A5-threshold1 and A5-threshold2. This paper presents a first study to analyze and optimize the three A5 parameters for jointly maximizing three key performance indicators that reflect mobile user experience: handover success rate (HOSR), reference signal received power (RSRP), and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR). As analytical modeling cannot capture the system-level complexity, we exploit a data-driven approach. To minimize the training data generation time, we exploit shapley additive explanations (SHAP) sensitivity analysis. The insights from SHAP analysis allow the selective collection of the training data thereby enabling the easier implementation of the proposed solution in a real network. We show that joint RSRP, SINR and HOSR optimization problem is non-convex and solve it using genetic algorithm (GA). We then propose an intelligent mutation scheme for GA, which makes the solution 5x times faster than the legacy GA and 21x faster than the brute force search.

The conventional route reconstruction method is designed to mitigate the effects of topology changes, but it consumes a large amount of resources. In this paper, we exploit the regularity in node mobility patterns to reduce the frequency of route reconstructions and ensure that the transmission of data to mobile nodes is efficient. To increase the data delivery ratio and mitigate the effects of packet loss caused by the node mobility, we propose a ZigBee node deployment and tree construction framework. In particular, the framework considers the regularity in mobility patterns during the construction of the routing tree and deployment of nodes. It also includes an overhearing mechanism for mobile nodes to further improve the data delivery ratio. We present details of the proposed algorithms for node deployment and tree construction in the framework.

In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised method, called AdattTUL, to make adversarial mobility learning for human trajectory classification, which is an end-to-end framework modeling human moving patterns. AdattTUL integrates multiple human preferences of check-in behaviors and involves an attention mechanism to dynamically capture the complex relationships of user check-ins from trajectory data. In addition, AdattTUL leverages an adversarial network to help in regularizing the data distribution of human trajectories.

To further improve the radio utilization, the Time Division Duplex (TDD) is considered to be the potential full-duplex communication technology in the high mobility 5G network. However, the high mobility of users leads to the high dynamic network traffic and unpredicted link state change. A new method to predict the dynamic traffic and channel condition and schedule the TDD configuration in real-time is essential for the high mobility environment. In this paper, we investigate the channel model in the high mobility and heterogeneous network and proposed a novel deep reinforcement learning based intelligent TDD configuration algorithm to dynamically allocate radio resources in an online manner.

Personalized POI recommendation is a significant task in location-based social networks(LBSNs) because it helps target users explore their surrounding environment and greatly benefits the business in real life. Although a personalized POI recommendation system can significantly facilitate users' outdoor activities, it faces many challenging problems, such as the hardness to model human mobility and the difficulty to address data sparsity. Moreover, geographical influence on users should be personalized, but current studies only model the geographical influence on all users' check-in behaviors in a universal way. In this paper, we design a novel and effective personalized POI recommendation system. First, our system mines the target user's active area based on his or her check-in history, and designs a personalized user spatial similarity calculation method based on the target user's active area. Secondly, our system takes into account three features of the human mobility pattern: spatial, temporal, and sequential properties.

Fortunately, with the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC), mobile devices can offload tasks to edge servers to efficiently solve the above problems. However, meeting the users&#x2019; QoS requirements with the help of deployed MEC facilities is still challenging since mobile users&#x2019; service demands vary depending on their dynamic location. In addition, increasing the number of edge servers to meet the requirements of applications would burden the initial investment and maintenance fee accordingly. In this case, using idle resources from nearby mobiles may become an effective solution. Most of the existing works do not consider the mobility of devices and users&#x2019; willingness to share. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the mobile device selection algorithms (MDSA), in which the social relationship, location correlation, and mobile activity of mobile devices were considered in the selection of target mobile devices, providing device-to-device offloading.

Many studies have explored various algorithms to predict where a user is likely to visit based on their contexts and trajectories. Most of existing studies focus on specific targets of predictions. While successful cases are often reported, few discussions have been done on what happens if the prediction targets vary: whether coarser locations are easier to be predicted, and whether predicting the immediate next location on the trajectory is easier than predicting the destination. On the other hand, while spatiotemporal tags and content information are commonly used in current prediction tasks, few have utilized the finer grained, on-device user behavioral data, which are supposed to be more informative and indicative of user intentions. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the mobility prediction using a large-scale real-world dataset that contains plentiful contextual information. Based on a series of learning models, including a Markov model, two recurrent neural network models, and a multi-modal learning method, we perform extensive experiments to comprehensively investigate the predictability of different types of granularities of targets and the effectiveness of different types of signals.

Surgical smoke has been successfully utilized in tissue identification in laboratory conditions by using a system based on differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) that could provide a seamless margin assessment method. In this study, a DMS-based tissue analysis system was used intraoperatively in 20 breast cancer surgeries to assess its feasibility in tissue identification. The effect of the system on complications and duration of surgeries was also studied. The surgeries were recorded with a head-worn camera system for visual annotation of the operated tissue types to enable classification of the measurement files by supervised learning. There were statistically significant differences among the DMS spectra of the tissue types. The classification of four tissue types (skin, fat, glandular tissue, and connective tissue) yielded a cross-validated accuracy of 44% and exhibited high variation between surgeries. The low accuracies can be attributed to the limitations and uncertainty of the visual annotation, high-within class variance due to the heterogeneity of tissues as well as environmental conditions, and delays of the real-time analysis of the smoke samples. Differences between tissues encountered in breast surgery were identified and the technology can be implemented in surgery workflow.

However, the process of predicting link quality (LQ) is nontrivial due to the streaming and dynamic nature of radio wave propagation, which is complicated by robot mobility. Due to robot movement, the wireless propagation environment can change considerably in terms of distance, obstacles, noise, and interference. Therefore, LQ must be learned and regularly updated while the robot is online. However, the existing fuzzy-based models for assessing LQ are non-adaptable due to the absence of any learning mechanism. To address this issue, we introduce a fuzzy-based prediction model designed for the efficient online and incremental learning of LQ. The unique approach uses fuzzy logic to infer LQ based on the collective output from a series of offset classifiers and their posterior probabilities. In essence, the proposed model leverages machine learning for extracting the underlying functional relationship between the input and output variables, but deeper inferences are made from the output of the learning algorithms using fuzzy logic. Wireless link data from a real-world robot network was used to compare the model with the traditional linear regression approach. The results show statistically significant improvements in three out of the six real-world indoor and outdoor environments where the robot operated.

MANET provides a quick to deploy flexible networking capability with a dynamic topology due to node mobility. MANET nodes transmit, relay and receive traffic from neighbor nodes as the network topology changes. Security is important for MANET and trust computation is used to improve collaboration between nodes.

Due to their constraints on both mobility and energy consumption, a key problem is how to deploy UAVs adaptively in a geographic area with changing traffic demand of mobile users, while meeting the aforemetioned constraints. In this paper, we propose an adaptive deployment strategy for UAV-aided networks based on hybrid deep reinforcement learning, where a UAV can adjust its movement direction and distance to serve users who move randomly in the target area. Through hybrid deep reinforcement learning, UAVs can be trained offline to obtain the global state information and learn a completely distributed control strategy, with which each UAV only needs to take actions based on its observed state in the real deployment to be fully adaptive. Moreover, in order to improve the speed and effect of learning, we improve hybrid reinforcement learning, by adding genetic algorithms and TD-error-based resampling optimization mechanism. Simulation results show that the hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm has better efficiency and robustness in multi-UAV control, and has better performance in terms of coverage, energy consumption and average throughput, by which average throughput can be increased by 20% to 60%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9348512/,2020 IEEE 92nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2020-Fall),18 Nov.-16 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The usage of UAVs for terrain monitoring and remote sensing is rapidly gaining momentum due to their high mobility, low cost, and flexible deployment. However, a key challenge is planning missions to maximize the value of acquired data in large environments given flight time limitations. To address this, we propose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain high-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas on the terrain with fine details as they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to perform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy on exhaustive mapping at maximum resolution.

In manipulation, the physical properties of an object may dictate the results of a grasping strategy. Thus, a reliable surface identification system would be invaluable for these applications. This paper presents an Inertia-Based Surface Identification System (ISIS) based on accelerometer sensor data. Using this system, a robot actively “knocks” on a surface with an accelerometer-equipped device (e.g., hand or leg), collects the accelerometer data in real-time, and then analyzes and extracts three critical physical properties, the hardness, the elasticity, and the stiffness, of the surface. A lookup table and k-nearest neighbors techniques are used to classify the surface material based on a database of previously known materials. This technique is low-cost and efficient in computation.

Awareness of obstacles such as debris, potholes, construction site, and traffic movement pattern improve mobility and independence of them. To address this problem, we implemented an interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device (IPSAD). The key idea is to use the power of deep learning to model the “obstacles” on a sidewalk to provide personalized feedback to the user. We focus on transfer learning and fine tuning of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time obstacle recognition that can be deployed in small form factor devices. This approach also account for issues related to the execution time and energy efficiency. We empirically evaluate a number of state-of-the-art architectures to choose the best model based on fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Finally, we built fully integrated IPSAD prototype on Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3). Audio feedback scheme were implemented to accommodate user preferences and personalization. We perform quantitative evaluation of the prototype system based on the accuracy of the model on Ambient Awareness on Sidewalk (AS) dataset, on-field system performance, data communication, response time (capturing images, recognition of obstacle and feedback), and failure points.

FPGA implementation is a viable approach to not only implement in the embedded system automotive electronics, but also accelerate the inference results, hence making it as an ideal real time candidate for passenger anomaly state identification. For the same, a real time emotion detection system using facial features was implemented on FPGA. A Binary Neural Network (BNN) feeded by Local Binary Pattern (LBP) output was designed towards the development of an improved and faster emotion recognition system. LBP is configured as a preprocessing step to extract facial features that is passed on to the BNN layer for successful inference.

ITS networks are comprised of the Internet-connected vehicles (mobile nodes), roadside units (RSU), cellular base stations and conventional core network routers to create a complete data transmission platform that provides real-time traffic information and enable prediction of future traffic conditions. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying ITS networks raise new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes and detection of security attacks due to such highly vulnerable mobile nodes. In this paper, we consider a new type of security attack referred to as crossfire attack, which involves a large number of compromised nodes that generate low-intensity traffic in a temporally coordinated fashion such that target links or hosts (victims) are disconnected from the rest of the network. Detection of such attacks is challenging since the attacking traffic flows are indistinguishable from the legitimate flows. With the support of software-defined networking that enables dynamic network monitoring and traffic characteristic extraction, we develop a machine learning model that can learn the temporal correlation among traffic flows traversing in the ITS network, thus differentiating legitimate flows from coordinated attacking flows. We use different deep learning algorithms to train the model and study the performance using Mininet-WiFi emulation platform. The results show that our approach achieves a detection accuracy of at least 80%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8746594/,2019 IEEE 89th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2019-Spring),28 April-1 May 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/WAINA.2016.80,DASITS: Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System,IEEE,Conferences,"The growing number of vehicles on the roads worldwide, lead to increase in the number of road traffic accidents. These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment. In this paper we propose a Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System based on the speed of vehicles, for effective lane changing in the dynamic mobility model. In our approach we present the lane changing based system on speed and minimum gap between the vehicles. The paper focuses towards the development of an Intelligent Transportation System that provides timely, reliable information to the drivers and the concerned authorities. The test bed is created on the techniques used in the proposed system where the analysis takes place in the On Board Embedded System designed for Vehicle Navigation. The designed system was tested on a Four Lane road at Neemrana in India.

However, machine learning in wireless networking faces several challenges because of the big or small data, unlabeled data, system complexity, long training process, resource constrained (energy, storage, computing) wireless devices, and constantly changing user mobility, dynamic network topology, susceptibility of wireless jammers and eavesdroppers, and operating wireless environment. In order to address these challenges, transfer learning is regarded as one of the viable solutions as it leverages the knowledge from similar past tasks for learning of new problems. In this paper, we investigate deep transfer learning for physical layer security in wireless networks with large-scale multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) system where previously trained model is transferred to a new wireless environment to predict secure waveform vectors and power levels for users who coexist with eavesdroppers (who overhear communications passively for resulting in lower secrecy rate for legitimate users) and jammers (who actively jam the channels or deteriorate the received signal at the legitimate receivers). In this case, a legitimate transmitter adapts it&#x0027;s transmit waveform and power using transfer learning to avoid jamming and eavesdropping impacts.

Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to a nerve's stimulation. In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description are essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed various hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. However, the performance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw EMG signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the feature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature description is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end optimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our approach. The proposed approach is implemented in Python with TensorFlow deep learning library, and it runs in real-time in general-purpose graphics processing units of NVIDIA Jetson TX2 developer kit. Our results demonstrate the ability of our system to predict fingers position from raw EMG signals.

In this paper, we present DeepCQ+ routing protocol which, in a novel manner, integrates emerging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) techniques into existing Q-learning-based routing protocols and their variants, and achieves persistently higher performance across a wide range of topology and mobility configurations. While keeping the overall protocol structure of the Q-learning-based routing protocols, DeepCQ+ replaces statically configured parameterized thresholds and hand-written rules with carefully designed MADRL agents such that no configuration of such parameters is required a priori. Extensive simulation shows that DeepCQ+ yields significantly increased end-to-end throughput with lower overhead and no apparent degradation of end-to-end delays (hop counts) compared to its Q-learning-based counterparts. Qualitatively, and perhaps more significantly, DeepCQ+ maintains remarkably similar performance gains under many scenarios that it was not trained for in terms of network sizes, mobility conditions, and traffic dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of the MADRL framework for the MANET routing problem that demonstrates a high degree of scalability and robustness even under the environments that are outside the trained range of scenarios. This implies that our MARL-based DeepCQ+ design solution significantly improves the performance of Q-learning-based CQ+ baseline approach for comparison and increases its practicality and explainability because the real-world MANET environment will likely vary outside the trained range of MANET scenarios.

An autonomous solution to detect passenger anomaly inside the moving vehicle without compromising on the privacy of the commuters is an ideal solution to this problem. Detection of passenger&#x2019;s state in the form of temporal posture of the passenger on a moving vehicle is an apt solution. The passenger state identification followed by a standard evidence capture and assistance system will fulfill all the demands of a safe mobility ecosystem. A proof-of-concept detection system is designed, developed and tested in a real-world scenario. An array of 15 pressure sensitive conductive (PSC) sensors were optimally placed inside a pair of cushion and rested individually on the backrest and the seat of a hired cab. The embedded sensors were interfaced to an edge device which is equipped to run CNN-LSTM hybrid model to identify passenger anomaly state. A dataset consisting of sensory signals for two different states namely - anomaly, and relaxed, on different road and vehicle conditions, using multiple trials from different subjects, was built to develop a robust model. The CNN-LSTM hybrid model running on edge device reported very high accuracy compared to other models such as SVM, and individual CNN and LSTM models. The CNN-LSTM hybrid model extracts spatio-temporal features to accurately predict the passenger state, which is otherwise a challenging task. A high classification accuracy was reported for the model when applied on unseen dataset which was different from the one used for training the model.

Service pricing schemes can regulate user task offloading and affect the total revenue of service providers. Investigating how to maximize the revenue of service provider and improve the utilization of edge computing resources becomes crucial while is challenging, considering the users mobility and the uncertainty of users service requests. In this paper, we model the dynamic pricing process of ECS as a Markov decision process and propose a dynamic pricing approach based on Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) by using the current load conditions and user characteristics, the goal of which is to maximize the revenue of service provider. In addition, considering more ECSs in the MEC system, with the dynamic variations of ECSs loads and the different arrival rate of user tasks, we propose a joint scheduling approach based on D3QN (called RLJS) to collectively improve the total service revenue of service providers. Specifically, we first use a data-driven method to group the ECSs and then devise a D3QN-based task scheduling scheme to distribute tasks among ECS groups by considering the load and price conditions in real time.

Service selection is a process to choose services that meet the functional and non-functional properties for each user. Some of the features of the IoT environment make this process more complicated. For example, user's mobility constantly changes the connected service collections. Because the dynamic nature of the environment leads to changes in the QoS (quality of service), judging a service that satisfies the needs of users in the future is difficult based on previous QoS static values. Moreover, an IoT service relies on its device, which is affected by CPU processing power and battery capacity. Hence, long-term and stable service cannot be provided to users. In order to solve the above problems, we need a service selection method that can consider the quality of the service and reflect the service context in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT service selection approach by using the linear reward inaction (LRI) algorithm to learn all subjective assessments from the latest user feedback and objective assessments of service.

However, MECs must cope with several challenges that do not arise in the context of conventional cloud platforms. These include the potentially highly distributed geographical deployment, heterogeneity, and limited resource capacity of Edge Data Centers (EDCs), and end-user mobility. In this paper, we present an elasticity controller to help MECs overcome these challenges by automatic proactive resource scaling. The controller utilizes information on the physical locations of EDCs and the correlation of workload changes in physically neighboring EDCs to predict request arrival rates at EDCs. These predictions are used as inputs for a queueing theory-driven performance model that estimates the number of resources that should be provisioned to EDCs in order to meet predefined Service Level Objectives (SLOs) while maximizing resource utilization. The controller also incorporates a group-level load balancer that is responsible for redirecting requests among EDCs during runtime so as to minimize the request rejection rate. We evaluate our approach by performing simulations with an emulated MEC deployed over a metropolitan area and a simulated application workload using a real-world user mobility trace. The results show that our proposed pro-active controller exhibits better scaling behavior than a state-of-the-art re-active controller and increases the efficiency of resource provisioning, thereby helping MECs to sustain resource utilization and rejection rates that satisfy predefined SLOs while maintaining system stability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355585/,2020 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC),12-14 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can make use of wireless connectivity and accurately execute control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional machine learning based controllers, solely trained by the CAV&#x2019;s local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by the CAVs&#x2019; wireless connectivity is proposed for the autonomous controller design of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in FL and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless channel dynamics, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence study is performed for the proposed algorithm under realistic wireless environments. Then, the impact of varying CAV participation in FL process and diverse local data quality of CAVs on the convergence is explicitly analyzed. Simulation results that use real vehicular data show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target speed over time and under different traffic scenarios, and it yields a distance error two times smaller than controllers designed using traditional machine learning solutions trained with the CAV&#x2019;s local data.

It also minimizes human intervention, especially in hard-to-reach areas where the use of ground-based infrastructure is troublesome. Drones can provide virtual reality to firefighters by collecting on-demand high-resolution images with adjustable zoom, focus, and perspective to improve fire control and eliminate human hazards. In this paper, we propose a novel model for fire expansion as well as a distributed algorithm for drones to relocate themselves towards the front-line of an expanding fire field. The proposed algorithm comprises a light-weight image processing for fire edge detection that is highly desirable over computational expensive deep learning methods for resource-constrained drones. The positioning algorithm includes motions tangential and normal to fire frontline to follow the fire expansion while keeping minimum pairwise distances for collision avoidance and non-overlapping imaging. We proposed an action-reward mechanism to adjust the drones’ speed and processing rate based on the fire expansion rate and the available onboard processing power.

Meanwhile, rental car industry has seen great developments in China and has reached a scale of economy. Knowing the rental behavior pattern and forecasting the demand become more important for rental businesses. To this end, in this paper, we aim to analyze the rental mobility pattern by examining multiple factors in a holistic manner. A special goal is to predict the demand of a given region. Specifically, we first analyze regular mobility based on real trips of rental cars. Then, we extract key features from multiple types of rental-related data, such as rental behavior profiles and geo-social information of regions. Next, based on these features, we develop a multi-task learning based regression approach for predicting rental cars' demand. This approach can effectively learn not only fundamental features but also relationships between regions by considering multiple factors.

As part of a real world trial in Waterford, Ireland, 150 dairy cows were each fitted with a long range pedometer. The mobility data from the sensors attached to the front leg of each cow is aggregated at the fog node to form time series of behavioral activities (e.g., step count, lying time and swaps per hour). These are analyzed in the cloud and lameness anomalies are sent to farmer's mobile device using push notifications. The application and model automatically measure and can gather data continuously such that cows can be monitored daily. This means there is no need for herding the cows, furthermore the clustering technique employed proposes a new approach of having a different model for subsets of animals with similar activity levels as opposed to a one size fits all approach. It also ensures that the custom models dynamically adjust as weather and farm condition change as the application scales.

This approach offers network operators with more flexibility to instantiate, configure, scale, and migrate VNFs at runtime depending on the demand. On introducing these VNFs at the network edges (e.g., base stations), emerging use cases such as connected cars can be supported. However, in such an environment, efficient VNF placement and orchestration mechanisms are needed to address the challenges of continuously changing network dynamics, service latency requirements and user mobility patterns. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we propose a neural-network model (i.e., a subset of machine learning) that can assist in proactive auto-scaling by predicting the number of VNF instances required as a function of the network traffic they should process. Based on the traffic traces collected over a commercial mobile network, the model achieves a prediction accuracy of 97%.

Not only inference but also training is moving to edge devices. DL application and dataset migration among these devices are mandatory for scenarios like node failure, user mobility or when nodes need to collaborate (e.g., distributed training). Container technologies and Kubernetes (K8s) are being increasingly adopted to manage infrastructure at the edge. Unfortunately, there is no built-in mechanism in K8s to support migration of stateful containers between its cluster nodes. The K8s cluster&#x0027;s master node generally launches a new fresh container in another node to replace the failed one. While there is an existing mechanism for migrating a Pod between K8s nodes, there is no past work investigating the migration of DL datasets and containerized DL applications among K8s cluster nodes. In this paper, we present our 1) comprehensive study on the effectiveness and limitations of existing checkpointing mechanisms for containerized DL applications and 2) our comparative performance study of several approaches in migrating DL datasets and applications in a K8s cluster. Our results show that migrating states of DL applications and restoring them from their previous states enables faster recovery (reducing training time by 10 to 73 percent) than re-running these models from the beginning regardless of the percentage of epochs that have completed. Additionally, our experimental results show that transferring a dataset between K8s workers using the K8s persistent volume with kubectl cp is generally suitable and efficient.

Moreover, the data analytics in 5G mobile network can be seen as a robust solution to transform the challenging features of 5G into a reality. So, for that, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has been introduced a network data analytics function (NWDAF) in 5G service-based architecture (SBA). NWDAF collects the data from different core and management domains and performs analytics on that historical data. It also enables the network operators (NOs) to train their Machine Learning (ML) techniques and use various third-party solutions. On the other side, the automation and management of the end - to-end (e2e) network slicing in a multi -domain environment is a critical task. Therefore, in this manuscript, we have designed a closed-loop Intent-based Networking (IBN) platform, which automatically ensures the commissioning, activation, run-time monitoring, and decommissioning of the network slices.

On top of these applications human segmentation is a key technology towards analyzing and understanding human mobility in those environments. However, existing segmentation techniques rely on deep learning models, which are computationally intensive and data-hungry solutions. This hinders their practical deployment on edge devices in realistic environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel micro-size LiDAR device for understanding human mobility in the surrounding environment. The device is supplied with an on-device lightweight human segmentation technique for the captured 3D point cloud data using density-based clustering. The proposed technique significantly reduces the computational complexity of the clustering algorithm by leveraging the Spatiotemporal relation between consecutive frames.

It involves various society's actors such as politicians, environmental analysts, energy providers, customers, business partners, etc. Offering analytical tools to analyze the EM activities represents a crucial issue for the involved actors. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of the usage of electrical vehicles. We focus on two main actors of EM: the French energy provider EDF and the users of electrical vehicles. EDF is in charge of providing energy power for electrical vehicles equipped with sensors. To understand the behavior of end users, our first contribution is the proposition of a data warehouse solution to store the large amount of data generated by sensors. Due to the heterogeneity of sensors sources, this data warehouse is based on a domain ontology developed in a modular way. An important aspect for EDF is the exploitation of the data warehouse by the means of business processes to obtain indicators, generate invoices, etc. Usually, these processes are defined outside the data warehouse and developed by software engineers. This solution is insufficient in our context, as EDF engineers are regularly designing, modifying and refining indicators. Our second contribution consists in connecting business processes to the domain ontology and then storing them within the data warehouse to avoid costly solutions such as outsourcing or training EDF engineers.

Compared to the static monitoring equipments, UAV-mounted high-definition camera and signal transceiver can be used cost-effectively as an on-demand aerial platform to detect the unknown region and send the real-time data back at the same time. However, these highlighted limitations of battery capacity and communication resource extremely affect the UAV’s performance such as flight endurance and data transmission. Motivated by the above conflicts, this paper aims to minimize the total energy consumed by the UAV during the region detection mission through jointly optimizing the collected data size, transmission time, and flying trajectory. Toward this end, we derive the optimal data collection and transmission time in closed forms via convex optimization, and propose a model-free reinforcement learning-based algorithm for training the UAV to plan its trajectory without knowing the environment information in advance.

10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127383,Participants Selection for From-Scratch Mobile Crowdsensing via Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Participant selection is a major research challenge in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). Previous approaches commonly assume that adequately long and fixed periods of candidate participants’ historical mobility trajectories are available before the selection process. This enables the frameworks to accurately model mobility which enables the optimization of selection. However, this assumption may not be realistic for newly-released MCS applications or platforms because the candidates have just boarded without previous mobility profiles. The sparsity or even absence of mobility traces will incur inaccurate location prediction of the individual participant, thus imposing negative effects on the participant selection process and hindering the practical deployment of new MCS applications. To this end, this paper investigates a novel problem called ""From-Scratch MCS"" (FS-MCS for short), in which we study how to intelligently select participants to minimize such ""cold-start"" effect. Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning, which we name RL-Recruiter. With the gradual accumulation of mobility trajectories over time, RL-Recruiter can make a good sequence of participant selection decisions for each sensing slot by incrementally extracting and utilizing the collective mobility patterns of all candidate participants, thus avoiding the prediction of individual participant’s location that is very inaccurate when the training data is sparse. We test our approach experimentally based on two real-world mobility datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that RL-Recruiter outperforms the baseline approaches under various settings.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9127383/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom),23-27 March 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/BigData.2018.8622491,Profiling Driver Behavior for Personalized Insurance Pricing and Maximal Profit,IEEE,Conferences,"Profiling driver behaviors and designing appropriate pricing models are essential for auto insurance companies to gain profits and attract customers (drivers). The existing approaches either rely on static demographic information like age, or model only coarse-grained driving behaviors. They are therefore ineffective to yield accurate risk predictions over time for appropriate pricing, resulting in profit decline or even financial loss. Moreover, existing pricing strategies seldom take profit maximization into consideration, especially under the enterprise constraints. The recent growth of vehicle telematics data (vehicle sensing data) brings new opportunities to auto insurance industry, because of its sheer size and fine-grained mobility for profiling drivers. But, how to fuse these sparse, inconsistent and heterogeneous data is still not well addressed. To tackle these problems, we propose a unified PPP (Profile-Price-Profit) framework, working on the real-world large-scale vehicle telematics data and insurance data. PPP profiles drivers' fine-grained behaviors by considering various driving features from the trajectory perspective. Then, to predict drivers' risk probabilities, PPP leverages the group-level insight and categorizes drivers' different temporal risk change patterns into groups by ensemble learning. Next, the pricing model in PPP incorporates both the demographic analysis and the mobility factors of driving risk and mileage, to generate personalized insurance price for supporting flexible premium periods. Finally, the maximal profit problem proves to be NP-Complete. Then, an efficient heuristic-based dynamic programming is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that, PPP effectively predicts the driver's risk and outperforms the current company's pricing strategy (in industry) and the state-of-the-art approach. PPP also achieves near the maximal profit (difference by only 3%) for the company, and lowers the total price for the drivers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622491/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10-13 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The contents can be requested from the proximity users via Device-to-device (D2D) communications while proactive caching the popular content to local users. However, the assumptions that content popularity is equal to user preference in several existing studies, which are invalid and not rigorous due to the fact that content popularity is calculated by the statistic of user requests within a certain period while user preference reflects the probability of a content requested by the individual user. Motivated by this, in this paper, we study the edge caching optimization of hierarchical wireless networks. Our aiming is to maximize the size of content offload by D2D communications. In particular, the edge caching policy with D2D sharing model based on the analysis of user mobility and social relationship is derived.

UASs have high mobility, are easily deployed, and capable of real-time monitoring of crowd behavior by utilizing multi-sensor-based detection and remote sensing of objects. These capabilities make UASs a very useful tool for Human Autonomy Teaming (HAT) applications, such as Law Enforcement (LE), capitalizing on Human Factors (HF). This study examines the concept of leveraging drone technology together with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to produce a UAS system that can assist LE in the monitoring and assessment of crowd behaviors during peaceful and non-peaceful events. LE agencies are increasingly being tasked with engaging in dynamic environments that exist at public events. Utilized as a force multiplier and autonomous tool, would benefit from an AI-UAS platform utilizing artificial intelligence assisting in identifying behavior of peaceful people as opposed to malevolent participants or instigators that may attempt to take control. AI-UASs of this type would allow LE to leverage existing resources within their organizational structures and provide increased situation awareness via a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) broadcast and monitoring of these dynamic environments. Information provided from these AI-UAS systems would provide real-time information to field forces as well as command and control operations that may be remotely located. AI-UAS Sensors can be dynamically allocated as needed for monitoring/documenting crowd behavior and police actions. Video recordings would provide evidence in court as well counter truth-bending recordings published by professional protestors and agenda driven main-stream media outlets. The benefits and impact of this type of LE AI-UAS platform would be profound. Traditional visible light based sensors can be greatly influenced by environmental factors preventing their ability to determine variations regarding abnormal crowd behaviors. In order to overcome this challenge, this project proposes to utilize four types of collection methods, Multitask Cascading CNN (MC-CNN), ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning Network, multiscale infrared optical flow (MIR-OF), and Event Cameras such as Event-based Vision, and Event Camera SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). AI methods will be developed to monitor crowd density, average ground speed, human pose estimations, and movement behaviors, as well as identification of primary violent instigators.

Public infrastructures such as tunnels and metro stations are paradigms, where travellers are frequently jammed at the exits, even under normal evacuation. Existing safety systems fail to guide effectively the most vulnerable travellers and to take into consideration the mobility impairment of each individual. In this context, current work, within SAVE ME project, proposes a robust evacuation mechanism from disaster areas in public transport terminals and infrastructures, which is incorporated in our Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS provides group-wised and personalized optimal routes to the exits, taking into consideration the personal preferences and capabilities of the travellers, along with guidelines to the rescue teams, given that rescuers must be sent to prioritized targets with trapped travellers. Furthermore, an innovative contribution of this work is the service personalization platform that was implemented in order to ensure the personalized communication of each traveller with the DSS. Service personalization is based on an intelligent agent framework.

The availability of large amounts of wireless channel data, the increase in computational power and the advancements in the field of machine learning provide us the opportunity to design learning-based approaches to address the channel quality prediction problem.

The MR data is generated by mobile objects while connecting to data services and is stored in backend data centers. To geo-tag or localize such MR data is believed to have a profound effect on the analytics and optimizations of telco and traffic networks. However, MR records are of noisy and partial observations regarding to mobile objects' geo-locations and hence pose challenges to accurate telco data localization. There have been quite a few attempts. Single-point localization methods map a MR record to a location, but come out with limited accuracies due to the ignorance of spatiotemporal coherence of successive MR records. Recent efforts on sequential localization techniques alleviate this by mapping a sequence of MR records to a trajectory. However, existing solutions are often with assumptions on specific models, e.g., mobility and signal strength distributions, or priori knowledge on topology space, e.g., road networks, limiting the deployment in practice. To this end, we propose a data-driven framework to tackle the challenges in sequential telco localization. We solely use raw MR records and a public third-party GPS dataset for the learning of the correlations between mobile objects' locations and MR records, requiring no model assumptions and priori knowledge. To handle the data-intensive workloads during the learning process, we use materialized views for efficient online localization and light-weighted indexing techniques for periodical parameters tuning, in order to improve the efficiency and scalability. Results on real data show that our solution achieves 58.8 percent improvement in median localization errors compared with state-of-art sequential localization techniques that require hypothesis models and priori knowledge, making our solution superior in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and employability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939387/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Particularly, many emerging vehicular applications require real-time interaction between the terminal users and computation servers, which can be implemented in fog-based architecture. However, it is still challenging to apply fog computing in vehicular networks due to high mobility of vehicles and uneven distribution of vehicle density, which may result in performance degradation, such as unbalanced workload and unexpected task failure. In this article, we investigate a new service scenario of task offloading under a three-layer service architecture, where the resources of vehicular fog (VF), fog server (FS), and central cloud (CC) are utilized in a cooperative way. On this basis, we formulate the probabilistic task offloading (PTO) problem by synthesizing task transmission, computation, and result retrieval, as well as characterizing the heterogeneity of computation servers. The objective of the PTO is to minimize the weighted sum of execution delay, energy consumption, and payment cost. To resolve the PTO problem, we propose a comprehensive task offloading algorithm by combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), called ADMM-PSO. The basic idea of the ADMM-PSO is to divide the PTO problem into multiple unconstrained subproblems and achieve the optimal solution in the form of an iterative coordination process. For each iteration, the solution is achieved by solving each subproblem with the PSO and updated based on a designed rule, which is able to converge to the optimal solution when the stop criterion is satisfied. Finally, we build the simulation model and implement the proposed algorithm for performance evaluation. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm under a wide range of service scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9495832/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",July 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Several systems were designed to improve the quality of the life of VI people and support their mobility. Unfortunately, none of these systems are considered to be a complete solution for VI people and these systems are very expensive. We present in this paper an intelligent framework for supporting VI people.

These techniques allow us to detect multiple objects and enhance the accuracy of the collision avoidance system. In addition, we introduce a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the image depth information and fuzzy logic.

An EQM tree is a shortest-path multicast tree with minimum end-to-end (E2E) cost (a combination of queuing size ratio and link stability) subject to QoS constraints such as queuing size ratio, link stability, number of hops, number of time slots and avoiding the licensed channel of primary users. Particularly, we propose an NP-complete optimization problem such that its feasible solution is an EQM tree. To address this problem, we design a new DQN model and a new game-based model to form EQM trees in real-time by offline training instead of online training as done in previous papers. Moreover, the DQMR protocol is also guaranteed to have high stability, low routing delay, low control overhead, and high packet delivery ratio (PDR). Furthermore, one more new contribution of the paper is that exact closed-form expressions for the E2E queuing delay of a multicast routing tree are also derived assuming random waypoint mobility and the reference point group mobility models to compare with simulation results of routing delay.

The generation of accurate scenarios and synthetic traces requires a precise modelling approach, and the possibility to validate them against real-world measurements that are generally not available for large-scale scenarios. This limits the open availability of realistic and large-scale traffic simulation scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to present a large-scale and high-accuracy traffic simulation scenario.

Furthermore, the combinatorial nature of MS&RA has forced the majority of existing proposals to focus on constrained scenarios or offline solutions to contain the size of the problem. Given the real-time constraints in actual deployments, a reduction in computational complexity is necessary. Adaptability is another key requirement for mobile networks that are exposed to constant changes such as channel quality fluctuations and mobility.

Furthermore, our two-stage CMAB design results in a tight model, which eliminates the theoretically feasible but practicality invalid options from the solution space. We prototype the first SDR-based D2D testbed to verify the performance of CBMoS under real-world conditions. The simulations confirm that the fast learning speed of CBMoS leads to outperforming the benchmark schemes by up to 132%.

In this paper, we have proposed a Convolutional Embedding Model (CEM) to predict next locations using traffic trajectory data, via modeling the relative ordering of locations with a one-dimensional convolution. CEM is further augmented by considering constraints posed by road networks in the traffic trajectory data, learning a double-prototype representation for each location to eliminate the incorrect location transitions as well as modeling the combination of factors (such as sequential, personal, and temporal) that affect the human mobility patterns, and thus offers a more accurate prediction than just accounting for sequential patterns.

In the considered model, the network can leverage human-centric information, such as users' visited locations, requested contents, gender, job, and device type to predict the content request distribution, and mobility pattern of each user. Then, given these behavior predictions, the proposed approach seeks to find the user-UAV associations, the optimal UAVs' locations, and the contents to cache at UAVs. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' QoE while minimizing the transmit power used by the UAVs. To solve this problem, a novel algorithm based on the machine learning framework of conceptor-based echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. Using ESNs, the network can effectively predict each user's content request distribution and its mobility pattern when limited information on the states of users and the network is available. Based on the predictions of the users' content request distribution and their mobility patterns, we derive the optimal locations of UAVs as well as the content to cache at UAVs. Simulation results using real pedestrian mobility patterns from BUPT and actual content transmission data from Youku show that the proposed algorithm can yield 33.3% and 59.6% gains, respectively, in terms of the average transmit power and the percentage of the users with satisfied QoE compared with a benchmark algorithm without caching and a benchmark solution without UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7875131/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,May 2017,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To design the adaptive transmission schemes, it is important to understand the realistic channel properties, especially in vehicular environments where the mobility of communication devices causes rapid channel variation. However, getting CSI estimates is challenging due to the lack of support for obtaining CSI from the chipset.

With mobile edge computing, microservices can be further deployed in edge clouds dynamically, launched quickly, and migrated across edge clouds easily, providing better services for users in proximity. However, the user mobility can result in frequent switch of nearby edge clouds, which increases the service delay when users move away from their serving edge clouds. To address this issue, this article investigates microservice coordination among edge clouds to enable seamless and real-time responses to service requests from mobile users. The objective of this work is to devise the optimal microservice coordination scheme which can reduce the overall service delay with low costs. To this end, we first propose a dynamic programming-based offline microservice coordination algorithm, that can achieve the globally optimal performance. However, the offline algorithm heavily relies on the availability of the prior information such as computation request arrivals, time-varying channel conditions and edge cloud's computation capabilities required, which is hard to be obtained. Therefore, we reformulate the microservice coordination problem using Markov decision process framework and then propose a reinforcement learning-based online microservice coordination algorithm to learn the optimal strategy. Theoretical analysis proves that the offline algorithm can find the optimal solution while the online algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore, based on two real-world datasets, i.e., the Telecom's base station dataset and Taxi Track dataset from Shanghai, experiments are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed online algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of service delay and migration costs, and the achieved performance is close to the optimal performance obtained by the offline algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8924682/,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,1 March 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To compensate for the severe loss and attenuation, beamforming training is used to determine the optimal beam direction and thereby improve directional transmission power.

Therefore, we propose a learning-based adjustable beam number training (LABNT) scheme to intelligently and flexibly select beam training candidates considering different user mobility and hybrid line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. In LABNT, several deep learning networks are parallelly constructed and connected to a reinforcement learning network to determine training candidates dynamically based on performance rewards.

In simulations, the proposed LABNT outperforms other existing schemes in terms of beam alignment accuracy, training latency, and system throughput. Moreover, following the IEEE 802.11ad/ay protocols, we implement realistic mmWave beamforming training on a programmable hardware platform with integrated 60 GHz wireless-gigabit (WiGig) transceiver devices.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121905,Evolutionary Coverage Optimization for a Self-Organizing UAV-Based Wireless Communication System,IEEE,Journals,"Self-organized wireless networks based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are receiving increasing attention due to their flexible deployment opportunities. Typically, UAVs are used as supplementary access points to existing ground infrastructure to extend network coverage and capacity. Therefore, finding the optimal position for each UAV is a crucial task that can be resolved by multiobjective optimization. In this paper, a self-organizing UAV swarm model is introduced as an evolutionary type of heuristic that can be adjusted in real time based on the network’s key performance indicators (KPIs). The exogenous dynamics of the wireless communication system are reflected by an end-user mobility model based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. To achieve versatility in the positioning of UAVs, a model of virtual forces is adopted to enable control of the movement of each UAV via a collection of persistent and mutable parameters of the system. Evolution is controlled by eleven strategic versions of parametric mutations, including a neutral benchmark process. The simulation results reveal that the suggested solution allows for a substantial increase in the KPI efficiency metrics relative to those of the nonmutated system. The results also addressed the presence of the Pareto front, where it is not possible to improve the selected KPIs without negatively affecting others. While existing research that focuses on evolutionary methods usually considers offline approaches, this work uses an online evolutionary approach that is able to solve the presented problem by taking the dynamic nature of the environment into account.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9583254/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, what information can be extracted for the network mobility management, how to exploit the knowledge for resource allocation and to meet the user-centric quality of experience (QoE) are not well understood and fully explored. To address this problem, we propose an online learning algorithm for dynamic channel allocation based on contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) theory. Especially, we divide the stochastic human behavioral data into two categories: the user location and the QoE-driven context. Noticing that the distributions of CSI vary spatially, we define a set of user&#x2019;s geographic locations that shares the same set of CSI distributions as a <i>cluster</i>, and the stochastic channel distributions vary across clusters. The problem is formulated as a novel <i>latent</i> SCB problem, where the proposed agnostic SCB algorithm could automatically find the underlying clusters and significantly improve the learning performance. We then extend our online learning algorithm into the practical multi-user random access scenario. We conduct experiments on a real dataset collected from China Mobile, which indicate that our algorithms outperform existing approaches tremendously and perform extremely well in <i>large-scale</i> and <i>high-mobility</i> networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972418/,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,June 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Cloud computing has proven to be an incredible technology for provisioning quickly deployed and scalable information technology (IT) solutions at reduced infrastructure costs. Cloud computing is unable to meet the requirements of low latency, location awareness, and mobility support. To solve this problem, researchers have introduced a trusted and dependable solution through fog and mobile edge computing (FMEC) to put the services and resources of the cloud closer to users, which facilitates the leveraging of available services and resources in the edge networks. Organizations are beginning to look at FMEC as the answer to the cloud computing problem. FMEC consists of putting micro data centers or even small, purpose-built high-performance data analytics machines in remote offices and locations in order to gain real-time insights from the data collected, or to promote data thinning at the edge, by dramatically reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to a central data center. Without having to move unnecessary data to a central data center, analytics at the edge can simplify and drastically speed analysis while also cutting costs. FMEC pushes applications, data, and computing power (services) away from centralized points to the logical extremes of a network. FMEC replicates fragments of information across distributed networks of web servers, which may be vast. As a topological paradigm, edge computing is also referred to as mesh computing, peer-to-peer computing, autonomic (self-healing) computing, grid computing, and other names implying non-centralized, node-less availability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8856278/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The development and performance evaluation of the VII-ANN and VII-SVR frameworks, in both the traffic and communications domains, were conducted using an integrated simulation platform for a highway network in Greenville, SC. In particular, the simulation platform allows for implementing traffic surveillance and management methods in the traffic simulator PARAMICS and for evaluating different communication protocols and network parameters in the communication network simulator, Network Simulator version 2 (ns-2). This paper's findings reveal that the designed communications system can support the travel-time prediction functionality. The findings also demonstrate that the travel-time prediction accuracy of the VII-AI framework was superior to a baseline instantaneous travel-time prediction algorithm, with the VII-SVR model slightly outperforming the VII-ANN model.

Current travel mode detection approaches require well-sampled and balanced data sets with ground-truth travel mode labels. The detection approaches are rarely applied and validated on large-scale, real-world data sets, which may not satisfy the data set requirements. This article proposes an LDV trip detection model as a supplement to current travel mode detection methods for the case when the training set is highly (and&#x002F;or completely) unbalanced, to the extent that classical machine learning approaches become difficult or impossible to deploy. The proposed model uses a novelty detection technique&#x2014;one-class support vector machines&#x2014;and a novel exhaustive feature extraction technique on continuous time series data [i.e., global positioning system (GPS) speed profiles] for single-mode trip trajectories. Training and validation of the model are conducted on a large-scale, real-world data set. The proposed method accurately identifies LDV trips from a broad set of multimodal trips by leveraging a wealth of pre-existing in-vehicle GPS travel data. Additional sensitivity analysis sheds light on the optimal training size and feature selection, which will benefit applications limited by highly imbalanced data.

10.1109/JBHI.2019.2891997,Lower Limb Motion Estimation Using Ultrasound Imaging: A Framework for Assistive Device Control,IEEE,Journals,"Objective: Powered assistive devices need improved control intuitiveness to enhance their clinical adoption. Therefore, the intent of individuals should be identified and the device movement should adhere to it. Skeletal muscles contract synergistically to produce defined lower limb movements, so unique contraction patterns in lower extremity musculature may provide a means of device joint control. Ultrasound (US) imaging enables direct measurement of the local deformation of muscle segments. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower limb movements. Methods: A novel algorithm was developed to calculate US features of the rectus femoris muscle during a non-weight-bearing knee flexion/extension experiment by nine able-bodied subjects. Five US features of the skeletal muscle tissue were studied, namely thickness, angle between aponeuroses, pennation angle, fascicle length, and echogenicity. A multiscale ridge filter was utilized to extract the structures in the image and a random sample consensus (RANSAC) model was used to segment muscle aponeuroses and fascicles. A localization scheme further guided RANSAC to enable tracking in a US image sequence. Gaussian process regression models were trained using segmented features to estimate both knee joint angle and angular velocity. Results: The proposed segmentation-estimation approach could estimate knee joint angle and angular velocity with an average root mean square error value of 7.45° and 0.262 rad/s, respectively. The average processing rate was 3-6 frames/s that is promising toward real-time implementation. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower extremity motion. The ability of the algorithm to work in real time may enable the use of US as a neural interface for lower limb applications. Significance: Intuitive intent recognition of human lower extremity movements using wearable US imaging may enable volitional assistive device control and enhance locomotor outcomes for those with mobility impairments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8606176/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Nov. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To model these trajectories, existing works learn different attribute representations by either introducing latent activity types based on topic models or transforming the location and time context into a low-dimensional space via embedding techniques. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach named Human Mobility Representation Model (HMRM) to simultaneously produce the vector representations of all four (explicit and implicit) attributes. The merits of HMRM lie in that: (1) it models the latent activity types and learns trajectory attribute embeddings in an integrated manner, and (2) it connects the activity-related distributions and these attributes embeddings by adding a newly designed collaborative learning component, and makes them mutually exchanged to take the best of both worlds. We apply HMRM to both unsupervised and supervised tasks including two activity evaluation tasks and two embedding evaluation tasks, on two real check-in datasets collected from Foursquare.

A specific problem that has recently spurred research interest is the so-called Social Circle Inference from Mobility data (SCIM), aiming at inferring relationships among users based on mobility data and without any explicit structured network information. The existing methods either require partial social ties or fail to model the implicit correlations between user links, thereby suffering from critical inference bias. We present a novel SCIM framework, called SCIM via self-Attention and Contextualized-embedding (SCIMAC) - a methodology capturing multiple aspects of users' check-in behavior and complex motion patterns of different users. Instead of directly applying the recurrent model on training user trajectories, the proposed method introduces a new module for context-aware check-in representation learning by adaptively incorporating the internal states of the recurrent layers, which is more effective than the context-independent check-in embedding used in existing social circle inference approaches. To model the underlying correlations between labels, SCIMAC leverages a more sophisticated label embedding technique to adjust the penalties for correlated users, enabling a better understanding of the user's hierarchy in the label space, and alleviating the inference bias. We empirically demonstrate that our SCIMAC model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8709700/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While forwarding content, nodes avoid congestion so that meaningful content related to prioritized mission goals can be disseminated.

Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth. Compared to several greedy but nonoptimal solutions, the execution time of our approach was at least 10 times faster and consumed 90% less energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7397814/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,March 2017,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, by leveraging private car trajectory data, we propose a novel systematic approach for implementing stay behavior detection and stay time prediction. Specifically, we first propose a fuzzy logic-based stay detection method for detecting stay behavior in a large-scale private car trajectory dataset. Then, we design a spatiotemporal feature extraction method called clustering and kernel (CaK) by considering the spatial similarity, temporal periodicity and spatiotemporal correlation of stay behavior data. Furthermore, we propose a stay time predictor (STP) based on gradient-boosting regression trees and a long short-term memory network that can estimate the future durations of private car users' stays in various scenarios. We perform extensive experiments based on two real-life trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the STP achieves a predictive accuracy (specifically, the root-mean-square error) of 123.94 and R2 of 0.893 for stay time prediction of individual stays.

10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2512380,Tensor Voting Techniques and Applications in Mobile Trace Inference,IEEE,Journals,"Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7365411/,IEEE Access,2015,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For mobility-impaired people who cannot use the traditional computer input devices, a voice-based interactive solution is highly desirable. Although some grid-based cursor control systems that use speech recognition show potentials, they come with limitations in processing time and difficulties in real-time applications. Since they are not natural enough to use, it is very slow to drill down the grid, and the point cursor selection range is prone to errors, and people need a more efficient and natural choice. To address these limitations, this paper proposes two novel speech-based target selection techniques: grid-based region selection (hereinafter referred to as “Region Selection”) and grid-based target search (hereinafter referred to as “Target Search”). Region Selection allows users to select targets directly using the selected area. Target Search permits users to move the cursor to a target in a specified direction. Experiments are designed and conducted to analyze the impacts of target size and target density on performance and processing time. The experimental results and comparison study with traditional solution show that both Region Selection and Target Search improve the participants' accuracy of target selection and reduce the processing time, especially for small targets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274480/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The aim is for maximizing real-time downlink capacity under the coverage constraint by reaping the mobility benefits of UAVs. The problem of three-dimension (3D) dynamic movement of UAVs under coverage constraint is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem, while a constrained Deep Q-Network (cDQN) algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated problem. In the proposed cDQN model, each UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its 3D deploying policy. The aim of the proposed cDQN model is for obtaining the maximum capacity while attempting to guarantee that all ground terminals (GTs) are covered. In order to satisfy the coverage constraint, a primal-dual method is adopted for training primal variable and dual variable (lagrangian multiplier) in turn. Furthermore, in an effort to reduce the action space of the cDQN algorithm, prior information is utilized for eliminating the invalid actions by the action filter. Experiment results demonstrate that the cDQN algorithm is capable of converging after some training steps.

Moreover, 5G enables billions of devices to transfer an unprecedented amount of data at the same time. This transformation calls for novel technologies like multi-access edge computing (MEC) to satisfy the stringent latency and bitrate requirements of the mentioned applications. The main challenge pertaining to MEC is that the edge MEC nodes are usually characterized by scarce computational resources compared to the core or cloud, arising the challenge of efficiently utilizing the edge resources while ensuring that the service requirements are satisfied. When considered with the users' mobility, this poses another challenge, which lies in minimization of the service interruption for the users whose service requests are represented as service function chains (SFCs) composed of virtualized network functions (VNFs) instantiated on the MEC nodes or on the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of joint user association, SFC placement, and resource allocation, employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The objective functions of this MILP-based problem formulation are to minimize (i) the service provisioning cost, (ii) the transport network utilization, and (iii) the service interruption. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to tackle the scalability issue of the MILP-based algorithms.

However, it inevitably raises an issue that may be aggravated by TUL, i.e., how to defend against location attacks (e.g., deanonymization and location recovery). In this work, we present a Semisupervised Trajectory- User Linking model with Interpretable representation and Gaussian mixture prior (STULIG)-a novel deep probabilistic framework for jointly learning disentangled representation of user trajectories in a semisupervised manner and tackling the location recovery problem. STULIG characterizes multiple latent aspects of human trajectories and their labels into separate latent variables, which can be then used to interpret user check-in styles and improve the performance of trace classification. It can also generate synthetic yet plausible trajectories, thus protecting users' actual locations while preserving the meaningful mobility information for various machine learning tasks. We analyze and evaluate STULIG's ability to learn disentangled representations, discriminating human traces and generating realistic motions on several real-world mobility data sets. As demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations, in addition to outperforming the state-of-the-art methods, our method provides intuitive explanations of the classification and generation and sheds lights on the interpretable mobility mining.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9165954/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,June 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971661,Toward the Formalization of Macroscopic Models of Traffic Flow Using Higher-Order-Logic Theorem Proving,IEEE,Journals,"Next-generation transportation will be integrated, interconnected and highly autonomous. One key challenge in traffic management is ensuring safety while maintaining the required level of service quality. In such future mobility systems, rigorous formalization and validation will thus become critical to ensure that the transportation network operates as intended, traffic properties are reliably maintained, and services resume in a timely manner after potential disruptions. Formal methods have recently gained considerable attention as a modeling and verification paradigm capable of addressing many challenges associated with next-generation transportation systems. In this regard, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving for formally analyzing transportation systems. As a first step towards this direction, we present a logical framework for the formal analysis of macroscopic models of traffic flow. Leveraging upon the high expressiveness of the underlying logic, we formally model the continuous components of macroscopic models while capturing their real behavior. In particular, we present a formalization of some foundation concepts of macroscopic models, namely density, flow rate, mean speed, relative occupancy, and shockwave using the higher-order-logic theorem prover HOL Light. This choice is primarily motivated by the fact that the macroscopic models deal with the traffic flow dynamics and thus play a vital role in planning strategies in allocating resources for implementing optimized and balanced transportation systems. For illustration, we perform the formal input-output and shockwave analysis of a German freeway. The case study demonstrated the practicability of this formal approach due to the high expressiveness of the underlying logic. The proposed research is first step towards formalizing the foundational mathematical theories and core concepts of traffic flow theory. This accomplishment will open new ways to plan and model various components of the transportation systems such as highway links, ramp metering, merging behavior and eventually address the problem of routing vehicles in a network of automated vehicles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8981902/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Conventional user identification systems require the deployment of dedicated infrastructure or the active user involvement. Motivated by the widespread usage of the WiFi-enabled mobile device (MD), e.g., people usually carry at least one MD in their daily lives, in this paper, we propose WinDUA, a WiFi-enabled nonintrusive device and user association scheme to infer user identity and mobility via a novel unsupervised association learning algorithm. First, we utilize our WiFi-based indoor positioning system to obtain the historical location data of each MD using only existing WiFi infrastructure in a nonintrusive manner. Then, we classify all the MDs into two categories: 1) static device (SD) and 2) mobile phone (MP), according to their location variations and overnight presences. Subsequently, we estimate the correct mapping between each SD and its user through hierarchical clustering and location similarity matching between its location and user's personal space. Finally, we make possible pairs of MP and SD according to their duration of coexistence as well as the historical location similarity to associate the owner of each MP.

Using Arsenal, we carry out a thorough comparative study of the algorithms, over massive traces collected from heterogeneous networks including WiFi, 4G, 3G and even the rare commercial 5G wireless networks. In particular, to enable convincing measurements for the dominated real-time video applications, we collect millions of practical video sessions in cooperation with a prevailing video service provider. The evaluation provides a handful of important observations, which are undiscovered before and have important impacts on future protocol design. Moreover, we will make the platform and algorithms open-source to enrich the research tools in the intelligent transportation community.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516990/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3008721,Intelligent Routing Orchestration for Ultra-Low Latency Transport Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Autonomous driving scenarios face the need for millisecond real-time response, which has led to the study of mobile networks with high speed and ultra-low latency. Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as a key technology for next-generation networks because it contains advanced functions such as centralized control, software-based traffic analysis, and forwarding rules for dynamic updates. In this paper, an SDN with flexible architecture is considered and a transport component is proposed. The component based on mesh topology is an example of joint route prediction and forwarding. First, different from existing transport protocols, the component can adopt a software-defined stream access control strategy that includes an extended forwarding mechanism (retransmission) to improve the short-term response performance. Second, we evaluate the impact of route prediction on transport network performance by using offline training and prediction. The key challenge here is that a suitable model needs to be trained from a limited training sample dataset, which will dynamically update the forwarding rules based on current and historical facts (network data). By introducing a parallel neural network classifier, an intelligent route arrangement is implemented in this work. Experimental results over different traffic patterns verify the advantages of the design. Not only does it enhance the flexibility of SDN, but it also significantly reduces the signaling overhead of the transport network without reducing the network throughput.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139204/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

JP-DAP is intended to ensure smooth functioning, improved customer experience, ridership forecasting, and efficient administration of metro rail transportation systems by integrating and analysing its many data sources. It consists of a middleware which is built on the top of a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Spark framework, along with a set of open-source software tools like Apache Hive, Pandas, Google TensorFlow and Spark ML-lib for real-time and legacy data processing. The benchmarking of JP-DAP was conducted using TestDFSIO and have found that it performs well according to industry standards. The specific use case for this project is Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). The analysis of Automated Fare Collection data from KMRL on JP-DAP framework have produced descriptive statistics visualisation of inflow and outflow analysis, travel patterns during weekdays and weekends, origin-destination matrix, etc.. Moreover JP-DAP framework is capable of producing short term passenger flow predictions using SVR machine learning algorithm with linear, radial basis function and polynomial kernels. Our experiments have shown that SVR linear kernel gives the most accurate results with the least errors in predicting the next day&#x2019;s passenger count using the previous five weekdays data. The station usage (one-to-all) prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is also integrated to this framework.

These depth recordings do not allow the identification of single individuals. For each door opening phase, the trained models predict the correct passenger count (ranging from 0 to 67) in approx.96&#x0025; of boarding and alighting, respectively.

In recent years, DDoS attacks have become not only massive but also sophisticated. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology has demonstrated effectiveness in counter-measuring complex attacks since it provides flexibility on global network monitoring and inline network configuration. Although several works have proposed to detect DDoS attacks, most of them did not use up-to-date datasets that contain the newest threats. Furthermore, only a few previous works assessed their solutions using simulated scenarios, easing the migration to production networks. This document presents the implementation of a modular and flexible SDN-based architecture to detect transport and application layer DDoS attacks using multiple Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Exploring diverse ML/DL methods allowed us to resolve which methods perform better under different attack types and conditions. We tested the ML/DL models using two up-to-date security datasets, namely CICDoS2017 and CICDDoS2019 datasets, and they showed accuracy above 99% on classifying unseen traffic (testing set). We also deployed a simulated environment using the network emulator Mininet and the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) SDN controller.

Previous methods assume that the homogeneous multi-modal data are consistent, while in real applications, the raw data are disordered, e.g., the article constitutes with variable number of inconsistent text and image instances. Therefore, Multi-modal Multi-instance Multi-label (M3) learning provides a framework for handling such task and has exhibited excellent performance. However, M3 learning is facing two main challenges: 1) how to effectively utilize label correlation and 2) how to take advantage of multi-modal learning to process unlabeled instances. To solve these problems, we first propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-instance Multi-label Deep Network (M3DN), which considers M3 learning in an end-to-end multi-modal deep network and utilizes consistency principle among different modal bag-level predictions. Based on the M3DN, we learn the latent ground label metric with the optimal transport. Moreover, we introduce the extrinsic unlabeled multi-modal multi-instance data, and propose the M3DNS, which considers the instance-level auto-encoder for single modality and modified bag-level optimal transport to strengthen the consistency among modalities. Thereby M3DNS can better predict label and exploit label correlation simultaneously.

The fluctuating market necessities, the distribution of production facilities, the influence of the emerging economies and the environmental compromise force transport logistics services to be as dynamic as possible, answering to real-time events while improving their reliability, efficiency and accuracy. But the transport logistics chain is made up of actors using their own information systems (IS) for the daily management. Although several standards from the logistics world are used for message exchange, there is still a need of agreement on using the same language while preserving the internal way of operation at each company. The solution to this need opens a new horizon in providing access to information in a common language (taking advantage of existing standards). This common language would allow deploying real-time cooperative planning algorithms to find the best route attending to criteria such as the most green, quick, economic and/or safe route as well as algorithms able to react to real-time events (e.g. delays, accidents, breakdowns).

Quantifying concentrations of aerosols, particularly near the surface, is foundational to the understanding of the sources, evolution, and transport of PM2.5 and will help to support environmental justice for communities across America and the world. Moreover, developing improved algorithms to accurately invert or retrieve surface-level PM2.5 from satellite remote sensing is critical to improve neighborhood-scale estimates of air quality [3]. In particular, past and future satellite polarimeter and lidar measurements will be key to understanding surface-level PM2.5 conditions in real-time across the globe. A current solution to the retrieval of accurate aerosol properties from satellite polarimeter measurements has been developed by NASA for the Plankton, Aerosols, Clouds and Ecosystems mission (PACE) mission in the form of the Micro-physical Aerosol Properties from Polarimetry (PACE-MAPP) algorithm [4]. However, because solving the vector radiative transfer is numerically intensive, and solving the non-linear inverse problem requires an iterative approach that for multiple channels involves hundreds of vector radiative transfer calls, this approach delivers products at a rate that has latencies too large for and is prohibitively inefficient for the large-scale datasets that will be needed to resolve PM2.5 at neighborhood-scale resolutions of less than 1 km by 1 km. PACE-MAPP solves this problem by developing a neural network framework to replace the complex and time-consuming vector radiative transfer calculations at each iteration. In this study, we apply the PACE-MAPP framework to polarimetry data gathered from the POLDER instrument (PO-Larization and Directionality of the Earth&#x0027;s Reflectances) [5] onboard PARASOL, a satellite that flew from 2006 to 2013 as a part of efforts to understand the effects of clouds and aerosols on the Earth&#x0027;s climate [6] [7], and demonstrate for the first time ever that a neural-network-based approach using coupled atmosphere-ocean vector radiative transfer can be applied to retrieve aerosol properties from satellite polarimeter data, and to take the first step toward evaluating the algorithm&#x0027;s performance at producing air quality products such as PM2.5.

A key to automated item distribution is to plan paths for robots, also known as task planning, where each task is to deliver racks with items to pickers for processing and then return the rack back. Prior solutions are unfit for large-scale robotized warehouses due to the inflexibility to time-varying item arrivals and the low efficiency for high throughput. In this paper, we propose a new task planning problem called TPRW, which aims to minimize the end-to-end makespan that incorporates the entire item distribution pipeline, known as a fulfilment cycle. Direct extensions from state-of-the-art path finding methods are ineffective to solve the TPRW problem because they fail to adapt to the bottleneck variations of fulfillment cycles. In response, we propose Efficient Adaptive Task Planning, a framework for large-scale robotized warehouses with time-varying item arrivals. It adaptively selects racks to fulfill at each timestamp via rein-forcement learning, accounting for the time-varying bottleneck of the fulfillment cycles.

The structure used is called ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System). This system finds practical use mainly in audio telephone (mobile) communication in a noisy environment (transport, production halls, sports matches, etc.). Within the experiments carried out, the authors created, based on the ANFIS structure, a comprehensive system for the adaptive suppression of unwanted background interference that occurs in audio communication and which degrades the audio signal. The system designed has been tested on real voice signals. Noise cancellation performance of the algorithms has been compared by means of SSNR (Segmental Signal to Noise Ratio) and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping).

KG are analyzed. An agent-based approach is presented to model current processes and to exploit the identified optimization potential. The developed system directly connects the information flow and the material flow as well as their interdependencies in order to optimize the planning and control in groupage traffic. The software system maps current processes to agents as system components and improves the efficiency by intelligent objects. To handle the high complexity and dynamics of logistics autonomous intelligent agents plan and control the way of represented objects through the logistic network by themselves and induce a flexible and reactive system behavior. We evaluate the implemented dispatching application by simulating the groupage traffic processes using effectively transported orders and process data provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, we modeled real world infrastructures and considered also the dynamics by the simulation of unexpected events and process disturbances. The results show that the system significantly decreases daily cost by reducing the required number of transport providers and shifting conventional orders to next days, which need no immediate delivery. Thus the system increases the efficiency and meets the special challenges and requirements of groupage traffic. Moreover, the system supports freight carriers and dispatchers with adequate tour and routing proposals. Computed tours were successfully validated by human dispatchers. Due to the promising results, Hellmann is highly interested in transferring the prototype to an application that optimizes the daily operations in numerous distribution centers.

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network.

While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model.

This practical problem is generally modeled using the vector bin packing problem (VBPP) and its variations. In the recent years, the heterogeneous VBPP with two sets of constraints has proven to be a good representation of container packing related problems. In this work we extend this model to a more realistic setting, by allowing multiple containers of the same type. To solve this problem, an integer program is designed. To be able to find feasible solutions for large scale problem instances, a greedy constructive algorithm is developed. With the intention of improving the solutions generated in this way, a local search is developed and used to extend the greedy algorithm to the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic. To evaluate the potential of using GRASP on this problem, several variations are designed and implemented. In our computational experiments, we have generated test instances based on real-world data. Experimental results show that the designed metaheuristic approaches provide high quality solutions compared to solutions obtained by the CPLEX solver. Further, one of the proposed GRASP variants has been adapted for the homogeneous VBPP and tested on standard benchmark instances in order to evaluate its performance against existing metaheuristic. The final conclusion is that the GRASP presents a promising approach for more challenging instances for which CPLEX cannot find feasible solution within a reasonable time limit.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8632779/,2019 China-Qatar International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Applications to Intelligent Manufacturing (AIAIM),1-4 Jan. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/IS.2004.1344628,Computational intelligence approach to real-world cooperative vehicle dispatching problem,IEEE,Conferences,"The vehicle dispatching problem for cooperative deliveries from multiple depots (VDP/CD/MD) is an important and difficult problem in the transport industries. In order to solve the VDP/CD/MD, A hierarchical multiplex structure (HIMS/sup ++/) calculation model is proposed. The HIMS/sup ++/ model take advantage of object-oriented modeling, heuristic method, and fuzzy inference in (atomic, molecular, individual) 3 layers, so it can find a utility decision (vehicles plan) close to expert dispatcher. Furthermore, since the vital input parameters are few and the computational engine is packaged into a software component, the HIMS/sup ++/ model is a convenient tool for the VDP/CD/MD. The HIMS/sup ++/ model and its optimization algorithm are implemented as a software component using object-oriented paradigm, and through meta-programming. The performance of the HIMS/sup ++/ model is evaluated through experiments using 3 days oil delivery data taken from an actual dispatching center in Tokyo area. A total of 27 tank lorries are available for daily cooperative deliveries from 3 depots to about 30-60 destinations with different owners are used to save a running cost. The experimental results and the evaluations by human experts confirm that the HIMS/sup ++/ model are better than the results of experienced dispatchers in six evaluation objectives, and can be applied to the planning support system for the VDP/CD/MD. The HIMS/sup ++/ model will be able to cover similar transportation problems in the real-world.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1344628/,2004 2nd International IEEE Conference on 'Intelligent Systems'.

10.1109/AITest.2019.00015,Constraint-Based Testing of An Industrial Multi-Robot Navigation System,IEEE,Conferences,"Intelligent multi-robot systems get more and more deployed in industrial settings to solve complex and repetitive tasks. Due to safety and economic reasons they need to operate dependably. To ensure a high degree of dependability, testing the deployed system has to be done in a rigorous way. Advanced multi-robot systems show a rich set of complex behaviors. Thus, these systems are difficult to test manually. Moreover, the space of potential environments and tasks for such systems is enormous. Therefore, methods that are able to explore this space in a structured way are needed. One way to address these issues is through model-based testing. In this paper we present an approach for testing the navigation system of a fleet of industrial transport robots. We show how all potential environments and navigation behaviors as well as requirements and restrictions can be represented in a formal constraint-based model. Moreover, we present the concept of coverage criteria in order to handle the potentially infinite space of test cases. Finally, we show how test cases can be derived from this model in an efficient way.

Since the simulation- based prototypes are available for virtual commissioning (VC) anyway, they can be used simultaneously as reinforcement learning environments. In this work, the event-discrete flow logic for the transport and assembly of a target workpiece is learned automatically by reinforcement learning on the real use case of the VC simulation of a PLC-based production system. According to the idea of curriculum learning, the system is trained separately in subsystems to support its modularity and to reduce the complexity of the overall learning process. With regard to the learning processes, subsystems, sequence errors, termination criteria and necessary action and state adjustments typical for the PLC-based plant are identified and implemented in the VC simulation.

The CPS framework is anchored on intelligent physical worlds (IPW) around which complex adaptation behaviors are built. An IPW is an embodiment of control software functions wrapped around the raw physical processes (such as routers, links, hosts, and protocols), performing the core communication activities while adapting its behavior to the changing network conditions and user inputs. The IPW exhibits an intelligent behavior over a limited operating region of the network system, which is in contrast with the traditional models where the physical world is basically dumb. To perform over a wider range of network operating conditions, the IPW interacts with an intelligent computational world (ICW) to patch itself with suitable control parameters and rules & procedures relevant in those changed conditions. The modular decomposition of a network application into IPW and ICW lowers the design complexity of network systems, and simplifies the system verification/testing.

10.1109/ICSME.2018.00014,DRLgencert: Deep Learning-Based Automated Testing of Certificate Verification in SSL/TLS Implementations,IEEE,Conferences,"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are the foundation of network security. The certificate verification in SSL/TLS implementations is vital and may become the ""weak link"" in the whole network ecosystem. In previous works, some research focused on the automated testing of certificate verification, and the main approaches rely on generating massive certificates through randomly combining parts of seed certificates for fuzzing. Although the generated certificates could meet the semantic constraints, the cost is quite heavy, and the performance is limited due to the randomness. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose DRLGENCERT, the first framework of applying deep reinforcement learning to the automated testing of certificate verification in SSL/TLS implementations. DRLGENCERT accepts ordinary certificates as input and outputs newly generated certificates which could trigger discrepancies with high efficiency. Benefited by the deep reinforcement learning, when generating certificates, our framework could choose the best next action according to the result of a previous modification, instead of simple random combinations. At the same time, we developed a set of new techniques to support the overall design, like new feature extraction method for X.509 certificates, fine-grained differential testing, and so forth. Also, we implemented a prototype of DRLGENCERT and carried out a series of real-world experiments. The results show DRLGENCERT is quite efficient, and we obtained 84,661 discrepancy-triggering certificates from 181,900 certificate seeds, say around 46.5% effectiveness. Also, we evaluated six popular SSL/TLS implementations, including GnuTLS, MatrixSSL, MbedTLS, NSS, OpenSSL, and wolfSSL.

Any autonomous driving system relies on multiple layers of software to function safely. Among these layers, the Perception layer is the most data intensive and also the most complex layer to get right. Companies need to collect and annotate lots of data to properly train deep learning perception models. Simulation systems have come up as an alternative to the expensive task of data collection and annotation. However, whether simulated data can be used as a proxy for real-world data is an ongoing debate. In this work, we attempt to address the question of whether models trained on simulated data can generalize well to the real-world. We collect datasets based on two different simulators with varying levels of graphics fidelity and use the KITTI dataset as an example of real- world data. We train three separate deep learning based object detection models on each of these datasets, and compare their performance on test sets collected from the same sources. We also add the recently released Waymo Open Dataset as a challenging test set. Performance is evaluated based on the mean average precision (mAP) metric for object detection.

On the contrary, the requirement of a perfect state for used materials is unavoidable in order to assure both transport reliability and passenger safety. Therefore, a real-time approach able to recognize and classify the defect starting from the finite element simulated ultrasonic echoes could be very useful in industrial applications. The ill-posedness of the so defined process induces a regularization method. In this paper, a finite element and a heuristic approach are proposed.

Researchers have studied disparity on tabular data a lot and proposed many methods to relieve bias. However, studies towards unfairness in graph are still at early stage while graph data that often represent connections among people in real-world applications can easily give rise to fairness issues and thus should be attached to great importance. Fair representation learning is one of the most effective methods to relieve bias, which aims to generate hidden representations of input data while obfuscating sensitive information. In graph setting, learning fair representations of graph (also called fair graph embeddings) is effective to solve graph unfairness problems. However, most existing works of fair graph embeddings only study fairness in a coarse granularity (i.e., group fairness), but overlook individual fairness. In this paper, we study fair graph representations from different levels. Specifically, we consider both group fairness and individual fairness on graph. To debias graph embeddings, we propose FairGAE, a fair graph auto-encoder model, to derive unbiased graph embeddings based on the tailor-designed fair Graph Convolution Network (GCN) layers. Then, to achieve multi-level fairness, we design a Wasserstein distance based regularizer to learn the optimal transport for fairer embeddings.

Among them, the most significant ones were due to the conflicts between a host MPI and a container MPI and the complexity of the communication layers underneath. Although porting containers to run with a single node using just the container MPI is quite straightforward, our exercises demonstrate that running across multiple nodes in hybrid MPI mode requires knowledge of Singularity, MPI libraries, the operating system image, and the communication infrastructure such as the transport and network layers, which are traditionally handled by support staff of HPC centers and hardware or software vendors.

10.1109/MDM.2016.57,Incorporating Weather Updates for Public Transportation Users of Recommendation Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"This work presents a system for augmenting the functionality of Yelp-like recommendation sites by enabling users to search for places bounded by travel-time when using public transportation, and modifying recommendations based on updated weather conditions. Using public transport, although is cheaper and efficient, entails that only fixed places of boarding/exiting may be used which, in turn, implies walking to (from) a particular location from (to) a given station. Given the impact of the weather on the mood and activities, preferences for a certain type of services may need to be dynamically adjusted based on the current weather or the near-future forecast, modulo travel-routes to preferred locations. In this work, we develop a model to predict a user's preferred mode of transport (car, or public transit) from their old check-ins and incorporate the weather context into the recommendation process. We use event-based modeling to control the extent of walking depending on user-defined tolerance information and live weather conditions.

This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9148208/,2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC),15-19 June 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Integration of IEEE 1451 services based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) enables simple implementation, interoperability, scalability of distributed system components, accessible in the form of network services. Addressing the transport latency and packet loss in distributed systems, we propose the concept of algorithms' and processes' implementation in the form of dislocated network services. Introducing the signal data paths, time-stamped data and time synchronization mechanism, we provide the support for real-time system characteristics. Each component on the data path is able to analyze the packets of time-stamped information, extract an adequate sample set, and apply this set to the input of the implemented real-time algorithm or actuator. Proper management of the time-stamped information along data path enables real-time actions despite the network propagation delay or other systems' latencies. In this paper, the presented architecture is used for integration of the signal prediction service in smart transducers network based on SOA. Purpose of the service is to predict the values of arbitrary signals in order to compensate network delay and packet loss.

Data collection and implementation of such systems is often costly, and few countries have support for such systems in their transportation budgets. In places where maintaining currency and accuracy of information is difficult, many problems arise. For instance, in Chennai, India, real time bus transit data is not maintained, there is no proper communication about the bus schedules, bus stops are not regularly updated and inconsistent information about bus stops is observed in the transport authority's website. We are interested in developing models for identifying bus stops from trajectories for situations where accurate and current information is not available and traffic conditions are challenging, such as Chennai, India. We develop a simple yet easily accessible Android mobile application (App) to collect GPS traces of bus routes. We use our App to collect GPS trajectory data from Baltimore, Maryland, a place where there are facilities to access up-to-date information about bus stops. We also collect GPS trajectories from Chennai, India. We then develop a model using machine learning techniques to identify bus stops from the collected trajectories. We experimentally evaluate our model by training it on the Baltimore dataset and testing it on the Chennai dataset, achieving testing accuracy between 85 -- 90%. This is comparable to the accuracy of 95% achieved by both training and testing on the Chennai dataset.

It is a challenging task with long horizon and sparse reward - the robot has to figure out physically stable design schemes and feasible actions to manipulate and transport blocks. Due to diverse block sizes, the state space and action trajectories are vast to explore. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach for this problem. It consists of a reinforcement-learning designer to propose high-level building instructions and a motion-planning-based action generator to manipulate blocks at the low level. For high-level learning, we develop a novel technique, prioritized memory resetting (PMR) to improve exploration. PMR adaptively resets the state to those most critical configurations from a replay buffer so that the robot can resume training on partial architectures instead of from scratch. Furthermore, we augment PMR with auxiliary training objectives and fine-tune the designer with the locomotion generator.

However, the exact calculation of closeness centrality is not feasible for large networks due to its high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new approach for fast estimation of closeness rank without calculating the closeness centrality of all nodes in a given network. A small number of nodes are used as training samples and several low-complexity metrics are used as input features. We apply a neural network-based learning to rank method to train the model.

How is this possible? And how can we replicate this? A crucial clue comes from neuroscience: the brain is a complex physical system and the network topology of its neural circuitry is a determinant of its emergent collective properties. Indeed, as the brain's neural network is already entrained in its physical hardware, it clearly does not require an ANN software add-on to learn from natural data. Self-assembled nanowire networks with memristive junctions represent arguably the closest hardware architecture to real biological neural networks and are thus uniquely placed to demonstrate genuinely neuromorphic information processing. Here, we present preliminary results on polymer-coated silver nanowire networks. Their neuromorphic architecture (densely structured network topology, memristive switch junctions and efficient interconnect) gives rise to a rich repertoire of collective nonlinear dynamics manifested through adaptive current transport pathways. The potential for associative learning is demonstrated in a test protocol in which a nanowire network is stimulated by multiple electrodes mapped to different spatial patterns. The capacity to process information in the temporal domain is demonstrated via simulations of a reservoir computing implementation in which nanowire networks are shown to perform tasks such as time series prediction and handwritten digit recognition.

Accurate and timely prediction on the future traffic flow is strongly needed by individual travelers, public transport, and transport planning. Over the last few years, with the exploding of traffic data, various big data analytics based methods have been proposed to predict the traffic flow. However, it is hard to provide timely prediction by processing real-time traffic data. This paper proposes DeepTFP, which conducts the prediction with a time series function which considers the spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data to track the changes of traffic flow, and DeepTFP uses deep learning to extract the feature of traffic data as the basis of the time series function.

For their successful deployment, the content providers are increasingly becoming interested in evaluating the performance of such traffic from the final users' perspective, that is, their Quality of Experience (QoE). For this purpose, subjective quality assessment methods are costly and can not be used in real time. Therefore, automatic estimation of QoE is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a no-reference QoE monitoring module for adaptive HTTP streaming using TCP and the H.264 video codec. HTTP streaming using TCP is the popular choice of many web based and IPTV applications due to the intrinsic advantages of the protocol. Moreover, these applications do not suffer from video data loss due to the reliable nature of the transport layer. However, there can be playout interruptions and if adaptive bitrate video streaming is used then the quality of video can vary due to lossy compression. Our QoE estimation module, based on Random Neural Networks, models the impact of both factors.

Flights recurrently deviate from their scheduled time of arrival, which has negative downstream consequences that affect the efficiency of operations. Therefore, accurate and up-to-date ETA estimations prior to its landing can help in optimizing the actions to be taken by the different air transportation agents whenever schedule deviations are incurred, and thus reduce the economic, logistic and environmental impact that they cause. This presentation exposes an infrastructure for high-fidelity computation of accurate ETA in real-time, based on a data-driven approach that leverages the use of recorded aircraft trajectories. This infrastructure is composed of different elements: (1) a live ADS-B tracks gathering system embedded in a lambda-architecture cluster, with capabilities for real-time distribution and data lake storage (2) an ETA prediction machine learning model, employing the actual 4D aircraft position as input; and (3) a hybrid cloud architecture to support real-time visualization and distributions of ETA predictions. The proposed infrastructure has been successfully validated in a real environment (Transforming Transport, an European Commission funded project).

Thereby the identification and classification of traffic play an important role for increasing the performance in network management. Primitive applications were using well-known ports in transport layer, so their traffic classification can be performed based on the port number. However, the recent applications progressively use unpredictable port numbers. Consequently the later methods are based on “deep packet inspection”. Notwithstanding proper accuracy, these methods impose heavy operational load and are vulnerable to encrypted flows. The recent methods classify the traffic based on statistical packet characteristics. However, having access to a little part of statistical flow information in real-time traffic may jeopardize the performance of these methods.

This makes the road traffic environment more and more complicated, and people expect to have an intelligent Vision-assisted applications that provide drivers with traffic sign information, regulate driver operations, or assist in vehicle control to ensure road safety. As one of the more important functions, traffic sign detection and recognition[1], has become a hot research direction of researchers at home and abroad. It is mainly the use of vehicle cameras to capture real-time road images, and then to detect and identify the traffic signs encountered on the road, thus providing accurate information to the driving system. However, the road conditions in the actual scene are very complicated. After many years of hard work, researchers have not yet made the recognition system practical, and further research and improvement are still needed. Traditionally, traffic signage has been detected and categorized using standard computer vision methods, but it also takes considerable time to manually process important features of the image. With the development and progress of science and technology, more and more scholars use deep learning technology to solve this problem. The main reason that the deep learning method is widely accepted is that the model can learn the deep features inside the image autonomously from the training samples, especially for many cases that do not know how to design the feature extractor, such as expression recognition, target detection Wait. Based on the application of road traffic sign detection and recognition, this article focuses on the correctness and high efficiency of detection and recognition.

Therefore, to reduce these attacks in real-time, a securing SDN enabled IoT scenario infrastructure of Fog networks is preferred. The virtual switches have network enforcement authorized decisions and these are executed through the SDN network. Apart from this, SDN switches are generally powerful machines and simultaneously these are used as fog nodes. Therefore, SDN looks like a good selection for Fog networks of IoT. Moreover, dynamically distributing the necessary crypto keys are allowed by the centralized and software channel protection management solution, in order to establish the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTIS) tunnels between the IoT devices, when demanded by the cyber security framework.

Even though traffic flow information is better than no traffic information, drivers still face dangerous congested traffic flow. Several approaches have addressed short-term traffic information in which a stigmergy-based approach is employed as an indirect communication method for cooperation among distributed agents and for managing traffic congestion. Recently, advances in Intelligent Transport Systems suggest a future in which vehicles handle their own positions. Our foresight-route-providing method combines a previous method that utilized the past travel times of vehicles for decentralized traffic congestion management. We assume that all vehicles collect dynamic traffic conditions in decentralized processing environments as real implementation environments during the simulations.

Organizations implementing such technology deal with both quality of service and security demands, therefore it is mandatory to investigate the impact of QoS parameters when applying security mechanisms in multimedia services for the case of videocalls. This work presents a study of quality of service indicators such as jitter, delay between RTP (Real Time Protocol) packets, establishment and release time for three levels of security, considering the effect over signaling and media planes of the videocall. Four scenarios were implemented in two groups: the first one consisted of a LAN with a Laptop and a PC with WebRTC clients or between a Smartphone and a PC as well. The second one consisted of a DSL WAN with a Laptop and a PC with WebRTC clients or between a Smartphone and a PC as well. The three levels of security for each scenario were implemented as follows: the first one without security, the second one with TLS in signaling, and the third with both TLS in signaling and DTLS in media traffic. Codecs employed were VP8 for video and OPUS for audio on every testbed over WebRTC with EasyRTC framework. The results show, in general terms that QoS media indicators were on the recommended levels according to ITU and IETF. Establishing and liberation time were degraded. In some cases there was an improvement, as in the case of jitter due to the use of RTP (Real Time Transport) protocol for audio.

Therefore, the presence of supporting mechanisms is necessary. To this end, honeypots can protect the real assets and trap the cyberattackers. In this paper, we provide a web-based platform called TRUSTY , which is capable of aggregating, storing and analysing the detection results of multiple industrial honeypots related to Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), IEC 60870-5-104, BACnet, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and EtherNet/IP. Based on this analysis, we provide a dataset related to honeypot security events. Moreover, this paper provides a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method, which decides about the number of honeypots that can be deployed in an industrial environment in a strategic way. In particular, this decision is converted into a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB), which is solved with the Thompson Sampling (TS) method. The evaluation analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9527936/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR),26-28 July 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/EIT51626.2021.9491894,Teaching Vehicles to Steer Themselves with Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,Traditional approaches for steering a vehicle using machine vision require large amounts of robust hand-crafted software which is both time consuming and expensive. The presented method uses a deep neural network to teach cars to steer themselves without any additional software. We created a labeled dataset for the ACTor (Autonomous Campus TranspORt) electric vehicle by pairing real world images taken during a drive with the associated steering wheel angle. We trained a model end to end using modern deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to automatically detect relevant features in the input and provide a predicted output. This means that no traditional hand engineered algorithm features were required for this implementation. We currently use an pretrained inception network on the ImageNet dataset to leverage the high level features learned from ImageNet to the steering problem through transfer learning. We removed the top portion of the network and replaced it with a linear regression node to provide the output. The model is trained end to end using backpropagation. The trained model is integrated with vehicle software on ROS (Robot Operating System) to read image data and provide a corresponding steering angle in real time. The current model achieves 15.2 degree error on average. As development continues the model may replace the current lane centering software and will be used for IGVC Self-Drive competition and campus transportation.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9491894/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT),14-15 May 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To release humans from the repetitive and laborious job, we develop an autonomous trolley deployment robot to detect, transport and collect the scattered idle trolleys to recycling points. This paper will firstly illustrate the entire collection pipeline of the deployment robot system and then address the key challenge: partial to full point set registration. With the perception framework, the robot can detect the idle trolleys and acquire the pose of the trolleys on the ground, and then capture the trolley from behind, along the same direction for subsequent grasping and manipulation. With RGB-D camera and a segmentation Convolutional Neural Network, the robot can generate a partial surface point cloud of the detected trolley. The resulting point cloud, data and a pre-scanned full trolley point cloud, model, are matched by an implicit pose. To tackle the low accuracy and long computation time issues, a novel searching space-constrained point set registration algorithm is proposed to register the two overlapping point sets. Based on Branch-and-Bound (BnB) mechanism, the error between data and model is iteratively optimized. The constraint of searching space speeds up the global searching of the optimal pose, by pruning the candidate spaces which is impossible to contain the optimal result.

To address the increasing energy consumption and throughput requirements of HPC, scientific computing and AI applications, libraries and hardware implementations now provide new floating-point formats, allowing mathematical function evaluations with different performance and accuracy trade-offs. In this article we present a methodology and its associated proof-of-concept tool to evaluate the benefits of custom accuracy of mathematical library calls in HPC and scientific computations. First, our tool collects for each call-site of a mathematical function the input- and output-data profile. Then, using a heuristic exploration algorithm, we estimate the minimal required accuracy by rounding the result to lower precisions. The data profile and accuracy measurement per call-site is used to speculatively select the mathematical function implementation with the most appropriate accuracy for a given scenario. We have tested the methodology with the Intel MKL Vector Math (VM) library, leveraging the predefined accuracy levels. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two real-world applications: SGP4, a satellite tracking application, and PATMOS, a Monte Carlo neutron transport code. The robustness of the methodology is estimated by measuring the numerical accuracy of the resulting optimized code, against user-defined criteria. We experiment and discuss generalization across data-sets and finally propose a speculative runtime implementation for PATMOS.

10.1109/49.310965,A novel neural network traffic enforcement mechanism for ATM networks,IEEE,Journals,"ATM has been recommended by the CCITT as the transport vehicle for the future B-ISDN networks. In ATM-based networks, a set of user declared parameters that describes the traffic characteristics, is required for the connection acceptance control (CAC) and traffic enforcement (policing) mechanisms. At the call set-up phase, the CAC algorithm uses those parameters to make a call acceptance decision. During the call progress, the policing mechanism uses the same parameters to control the user's traffic within its declared values in order to protect the network's resources and avoid possible congestion problems. A novel policing mechanism using neural networks (NNs) is presented. This is based upon an accurate estimation of the probability density function (pdf) of the traffic via its count process and implemented using NNs. The pdf-based policing is made possible only by NNs because pdf policing requires complex calculations, in real-time, at very high speeds. The architecture of the policing mechanism is composed of two interconnected NNs.

It is possible to obtain enough information from the characteristics of the detected objects, their centroid's position and their trajectories as to detect some predefined events. Working without the operator supervision the application analyses the video streams from the CCTV surveillance system, discarding empty scenes for monitoring or recording, showing to the operator those fulfilling predefined requirements, like crowding, and rising an alarm to call the operator attention when it decides that an event may be taking place. The application is based on very simple algorithms in order to allow a single computer the analysis of up to eight video streams in real-time.

Perhaps because these companies would like to improve this situation, or perhaps because they simply would like to reduce the petrol they consume, they are more than ever deploying plans in order to increase the efficiency of their fleets. One of the easiest and cheapest ways to achieve this is to teach their drivers how to be more efficient. Nevertheless, traditional learning approaches were only successful in the short term, according to the previous work. In order to achieve long-term results, new learning paradigms must be taken into account. Furthermore, if we combine these paradigms with a learning analytics system, optimal results may be reached for both the company and the drivers. In this paper, we present a learning analytics system applied to the efficient driving context. This learning analytics system is used as a fundamental piece in the deployment of the blended learning methodology for efficient professional driving designed by our research group.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction–transformation–loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962–2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6725615/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,May 2014,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we propose an attention-powered deep convolutional network (AttnConv-net) to detect multiple rail components including the rail, clips, and bolts. The proposed method consists of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) as the backbone, cascading attention blocks (CAB), and two feed forward networks (FFN). Two types of positional embedding are applied to enrich information in latent features extracted from the backbone. Based on processed latent features, the CAB aims to learn the local context of rail components including their categories and component boundaries. Final categories and bounding boxes are generated via two FFN implemented in parallel. To enhance the detection of small components, various data augmentation methods are employed in training process. The effectiveness of the proposed AttnConv-net is validated with one real dataset and another synthesized dataset. Compared with classic convolutional neural network based methods, our proposed method simplifies the detection pipeline by eliminating the need of prior- and post-processing, which offers a new speed-quality solution to enable faster and more accurate image-based rail component detections.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9634063/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Feb.1, 2022",ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A different approach could be to move the decision making toward the nodes and subsystems, so they can adapt dynamically the capacity to the actual needs and thus reduce operational costs in terms of energy consumption. To achieve this, several technological challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we focus on the autonomous operation of Digital Subcarrier Multiplexing (DSCM) systems, which enable the transmission of multiple and independent subcarriers (SC). Herein, we present several solutions enabling the autonomous DSCM operation, including: i) SC quality of transmission estimation; ii) autonomous SC operation at the transmitter side and blind SC configuration recognition at the receiver side; and iii) intent-based capacity management implemented through Reinforcement Learning.

This paper discusses the current research in this field and the challenges that arise in the execution of these smart spaces. We address the major challenges of hardware design, data analysis, and energy efficiency in a new data aware smart environment that collects time-stamped data for position, movement, temperature, and vibration sensors. Data collected from these sensors is used to achieve energy efficiency, for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate six different machine learning algorithms for human activity detection task, on a data set collected in our laboratory. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up to 99.95% classification accuracy. We also implemented energy-efficiency measures, leading to up to 30% energy efficiency improvement on top of our initial design. This ambient environment, along with data analytics and improved energy efficiency, provides information regarding the occupancy and behavior of people within its range. Spaces such as conference rooms, common areas such as libraries, classrooms, and even public spaces such as public transport can benefit from our design.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026540,Challenges on the Way of Implementing TCP Over 5G Networks,IEEE,Journals,"5G cellular communication, especially with its hugely available bandwidth provided by millimeter-wave, is a promising technology to fulfill the coming high demand for vast data rates. These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks. It provides the analysis of the effects of TCP in 5G mmWave networks, the discussion of TCP mechanisms and parameters involved in the performance over 5G networks, and a survey of current challenges, solutions, and proposals.

Several predictive monitoring techniques have been proposed in the past. However, so far those prediction techniques have been assessed only independently from each other, making it hard to reliably compare their applicability and accuracy. We empirically analyze and compare three main classes of predictive monitoring techniques, which are based on machine learning, constraint satisfaction, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) aggregation. Based on empirical evidence from an industrial case study in the area of transport and logistics, we assess those techniques with respect to five accuracy indicators. We further determine the dependency of accuracy on the point in time during process execution when a prediction is made in order to determine lead-times for accurate predictions. Our evidence suggests that, given a lead-time of half of the process duration, all predictive monitoring techniques consistently provide an accuracy of at least 70%. Yet, it also becomes evident that the techniques differ in terms of how accurately they may predict violations and nonviolations. To improve the prediction process, we thus exploit the characteristics of the individual techniques and propose their combination. Based on our case study data, evidence indicates that certain combinations of techniques may outperform individual techniques with respect to specific accuracy indicators. Combining constraint satisfaction with QoS aggregation, for instance, improves precision by 14%; combining machine learning with constraint satisfaction shows an improvement in recall by 23%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6882809/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",Feb. 2015,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since large and diverse datasets for training of Machine Learning (ML) models can rarely be found in individual medical centers, classical centralized AI requires moving privacy-sensitive data from medical institutions to data centers that process the fused information. Training on data centers thus requires higher communication resource/energy demands while violating privacy. This is considered today as a significant bottleneck in pursuing scientific collaboration across trans-national clinical medical research centers. Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed AI approach that enables the cooperative training of ML models, without the need of sharing patient data. This paper dives into the analysis of different FL methods and proposes a real-time distributed networking framework based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In particular, we design a number of solutions for ML over networks, based on FL tools relying on a parameter server (PS) and fully decentralized paradigms driven by consensus methods. The proposed approach is validated in the context of brain tumor segmentation, using a modified version of the popular U-NET model with representative clinical datasets obtained from the daily clinical workflow. The FL process is implemented on multiple physically separated machines located in different countries and communicating over the Internet.

While IP based video broadcast is well established in the data plane, the use of IP networks to transport media flows still poses challenges in terms of resource management and orchestration. Software Defined Networking (SDN) based orchestration architectures have emerged in the industry that use SDN to route the media flows of a broadcast service across the provider IP network. Several approaches to multimedia flow routing in IP based SDN networks have been proposed in the context of streaming applications over the Internet. These range from model based linear optimization solutions that have high complexity to simple shortest path based routing with either Static Link Costs (SLC) or Dynamic Link Costs (DLC). More recently model-free optimization methods such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been proposed for routing and Traffic Engineering (TE) of multimedia flows in SDN networks. The media broadcast scenario however has specific requirements, with services like Master Control Room (MCR) operation and live broadcasting of events, and it has been rarely addressed in the literature. In this work we propose a DRL based routing method for this scenario and compare it to SLC and DLC algorithms based on Dijkstra shortest paths. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to follow this approach in the context of media broadcast services in IP infrastructures. The algorithm is designed considering the specifications and capabilities of one of the leading SDN orchestrators in the market and considers the more common Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements in the industry. Three different DRL algorithms are implemented and compared and we evaluate them using a real service provider network topology. The results indicate that DRL based routing is applicable in real production scenarios and that it achieves considerable performance gains when compared to the SLC and DLC shortest path algorithms commonly used today.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9793657/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we cast the problem of human trajectory forecasting as learning a representation of human social interactions. Early works handcrafted this representation based on domain knowledge. However, social interactions in crowded environments are not only diverse but often subtle. Recently, deep learning methods have outperformed their handcrafted counterparts, as they learn about human-human interactions in a more generic data-driven fashion. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of existing deep learning-based methods for modelling social interactions. We propose two domain-knowledge inspired data-driven methods to effectively capture these social interactions.

However, the efficiency of clustering algorithms decreases as the amount of data increases. In addition, most of the existing methods optimize only one objective and therefore may be suitable only for datasets with certain features. To address these limitations, in this paper, we develop a new hybrid chain-hypergraph P system (named HCHPS), which makes full use of the parallelism of P systems as well as the advantages of chain and hypergraph topology structures for accurate and efficient clustering. Our new P system comprises three types of subsystems, i.e., reaction chain membrane subsystems, local communication membrane subsystems and global ensemble membrane subsystems. Each type of subsystems is implemented end-to-end in HCHPS with new rules and membrane structures in parallel. In particular, to obtain efficient clustering center objects and make the algorithm robust to data with various features, the reaction chain membrane subsystems perform three different multiobjective strategies simultaneously by new chain evolution rules. To increase the population diversity of cluster centers, the local communication membrane subsystems utilize transport rules between membranes for coevolution of nondominated objects. The global ensemble membrane subsystems conduct a new dense representation multisize ensemble strategy to further improve the accuracy of the final results. Evaluations on two artificial data sets and 17 real-life data sets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in correctly clustering data sets with different dimensions and shapes. Our experimental results outperform those of both baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, benefiting from the parallelism, HCHPS is less time consuming than other methods, featuring an average completion time of 28.07 seconds on the 17 real-life data sets.

However, this is not an easy task because many aspects need to be considered to make realistic recommendations: the context of a tourist destination visited, lack of updated information about points of interest, transport information, weather forecast, etc. The recommendations concerning a tourist destination must be linked to the interests and constraints of the tourist. In this research, we present a mobile recommender system based on Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP)/Time Depending (TD) - Orienteering Problem (OP) - Time Windows (TW), which analyzes in real time the user's constraints and the points of interest's constraints. For solving TTDP, we clustered preferences depending on the number of days that a tourist will visit a tourist destination using a k-means algorithm. Then, with a genetic algorithm (GA), we optimize the proposed itineraries to tourists for facilitating the organization of their visits. We also used a parametrized fitness function to include any element of the context to generate an optimized recommendation. Our recommender is different from others because it is scalable and adaptable to environmental changes and users' interests, and it offers real-time recommendations. To test our recommender, we developed an application that uses our algorithm. Finally, 131 tourists used this recommender system and an analysis of users' perceptions was developed. Metrics were also used to detect the percentage of precision, in order to determine the degree of accuracy of the recommender system.

As a result, improving network performance for HSR scenarios has become urgent and widespread concerns. Some previous works quantitatively analyzed the TCP performance on HSR and proposed relevant solutions. Other works focused on the handover problem (the leading cause of poor network performance on HSR), and proposed a series of handover algorithms for HSR scenarios. However, the existing works are either limited to only measurement studies without algorithm implementation or lack of integration with real-world scenarios. In this paper, with a large amount of field measurement data in real HSR networks, we study the main reasons why traditional TCP performs poorly in HSR scenarios. To improve the TCP performance, we propose Hd-TCP, a customized Congestion Control (CC) algorithm designed to deal with frequent handover on HSR from the transport layer perspective. For the transmission characteristic on HSR, Hd-TCP can accurately evaluate the link condition and apply a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make a fine control.

Hence, reliable uplink connectivity becomes a necessity. Next-generation vehicles will be equipped with multiple wireless interfaces, and require robust mechanisms for reliable and efficient management of such communication interfaces. In this context, the contribution of this article is a learning based approach for interface selection known as the Multi-Armed Bandit Adaptive Similarity-based Regressor (MABASR). MABASR takes advantage of the underlying linear relationship between channel quality parameters and uplink data rate to realise a robust interface selection policy. It is shown how this approach outperforms algorithms developed in prior work, achieving up to two orders of magnitude lower standard deviation of the obtained reward when trained on different data sets.

Such a system fits naturally with the development of an external vision system proposed by NASA for use in high-speed civil transport aircraft with limited cockpit visibility. The detection techniques should provide high detection probability for obstacles that can vary from subpixels to a few pixels in size, while maintaining a low false alarm probability in the presence of noise and severe background clutter. Furthermore, the detection algorithms must be able to report such obstacles in a timely fashion, imposing severe constraints on their execution time. For this purpose, we have implemented a number of algorithms to detect airborne obstacles using image sequences obtained from a camera mounted on an aircraft. This paper describes the methodology used for characterizing the performance of the dynamic programming obstacle detection algorithm and its special cases. The experimental results were obtained using several types of image sequences, with simulated and real backgrounds.

By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks. We demonstrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of <i>Citrus</i>: a novel intrusion detection framework which is adept at tackling emerging threats through the collection and labelling of live attack data by utilising diverse Internet vantage points in order to detect and classify malicious behaviour using graph-based metrics as well as a range of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Citrus considers the importance of ground truth data validation and its flexible software architecture enables both the real-time and offline profiling, detection and classification of emerging cyber-attacks under optimal computational costs.

The proposed infrastructure is utilized for monitoring the cutting process while maintaining the cutting stability of CNC machines in order to ensure effective cutting processes that can help to increase the quality of products. For this purpose, a force sensor is installed in the milling CNC machine center to measure the vibration conditions. Accordingly, an IoT architecture is designed to connect the sensor node and the cloud server to capture the real-time machine&#x2019;s status via message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. To classify the different cutting conditions (i.e., stable cutting and unstable cuttings), an improved model of DNN is designed in order to maintain the healthy state of the CNC machine. As a result, the developed deep learning can accurately investigate if the transmitted data of the smart sensor via the internet is real cutting data or fake data caused by cyber-attacks or the inefficient reading of the sensor due to the environment temperature, humidity, and noise signals. The outstanding results are obtained from the proposed approach indicating that deep learning can outperform other traditional machine learning methods for vibration control. The Contact elements for IoT are utilized to display the cutting information on a graphical dashboard and monitor the cutting process in real-time. Experimental verifications are performed to conduct different cutting conditions of slot milling while implementing the proposed deep machine learning and IoT-based monitoring system.

The real-time monitoring and data recording function of vehicle-mounted equipment provides data support for vehicle status assessment and fault warning. In this paper, the real-time data collected by CAN-BUS system of Beijing Bus Group are preprocessed and discretized. On the basis of the traditional rough set theory, a new coding method is set up, and the dependency between conditional attributes and decision attributes is set as an adaptive function, which is reduced by genetic algorithm and cellular genetic algorithm respectively. The calculation results show that the key fault information of public transport vehicles is instrumental speed, oil pressure, percentage of torque, timing engine speed, and coolant temperature. By comparing the results of reduction, it is found that the cellular genetic algorithm has higher applicability than the genetic algorithm in terms of algorithm efficiency, stability, and convergence quality. Although the genetic algorithm attribute reduction is slightly better than the cellular genetic algorithm attribute reduction in the rule matching, the cellular genetic algorithm has a better ability to excavate information within the acceptable compatibility range. Finally, the selected key factors will be deployed on the Beijing Bus Group's big data platform and displayed in real time.

QoT prediction techniques have been used to assure the quality of new lightpaths as well as that of the previously provisioned ones. Traditionally, two different approaches have been used: analytical methods, which take into account most physical impairments that are accurate but complex, and high margin formulas, which require much less computational resources at the cost of high margins. With the recent progress of machine learning (ML) together with software defined networking (SDN), ML has been considered as another option that could be both accurate and that does not consume as many resources as analytical methods. SDN architectures are difficult to scale because they are usually centralized; this is even worse with QoT predictors using ML.

But this task is very difficult and challenging due to the dynamic condition of roads. Many solutions have been given by the researchers to overcome these challenges. Some of them are giving good performance but computationally highly expensive and fail in some circumstances. In the proposed method, a feature based cost effective detection and classification method is proposed that is suitable for real time applications, provide satisfactory accuracy and computationally cheap. The proposed method uses haar-like features of the images and AdaBoost classifier for detection which provides a very fast detection rate with high accuracy. To reduce inconsiderable false positive rate generated by this method, we propose to use two virtual detection lines (VDL) that reduces the false positive rate. In order to predict the class of a vehicle, a feature based method is proposed. HOG, SIFT, SURF all are well represented feature for image classification. The existing feature based vehicle classification methods lack accuracy because of using those features inefficiently. In order to reduce those lacking, we propose to use bag of visual words (BOVW) model for classification. BOVW model also needs a lower computation time and resources. As the proposed method aims to be implemented in real time, we propose to use SURF feature for BOVW which is faster to compute and well described for recognizing an object. The BOVW then used for identifying the vehicle's class by multi class SVM classifier. Error correcting output code (ECOC) framework is used to achieve multi class prediction with SVM.

Most of the existing TSR methods are based on deep learning, but most of those are limited by the contradiction between the reliability and the real-time performance of the model, and it is difficult to be widely used in TSR. In the automatic driving system, the accuracy and real-time requirements of target recognition are strict. In particular, the proportion of traffic signs in the image is small, which will greatly increase the difficulty of recognition. Detection errors and untimely information acquisition can easily lead to traffic accidents. Meanwhile, to meet the needs of network deployment on in-vehicle devices, there are also higher requirements for model size and calculation. Therefore, designing a lightweight neural network with fast detection speed and high recognition accuracy is particularly important for the development of autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv5 for traffic sign recognition, and conducted experiments on the traffic sign dataset named TT100K. The results show that our method exhibits excellent performance in TSR, and the overall accuracy has been improved, especially for the small-sized targets recognition.

Accurate modelling of a large and complex system requires large datasets to train a deep neural network that causes a challenge of scale as training the network and serving the model are computationally and memory intensive. One example of a complex system that produces a large number of spatial time-series is a large road sensor infrastructure deployed for traffic monitoring. The goal of this work is twofold: 1) To model large amount of spatial time-series from road sensors; 2) To address the scalability problem in a real-life task of large-scale road traffic prediction which is an important part of an Intelligent Transportation System.We propose a partitioning technique to tackle the scalability problem that enables parallelism in both training and prediction: 1) We represent the sensor system as a directed weighted graph based on the road structure, which reflects dependencies between sensor readings, and weighted by sensor readings and inter-sensor distances; 2) We propose an algorithm to automatically partition the graph taking into account dependencies between spatial time-series from sensors; 3) We use the generated sensor graph partitions to train a prediction model per partition. Our experimental results on traffic density prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks show that the partitioning-based models take 2x, if run sequentially, and 12x, if run in parallel, less training time, and 20x less prediction time compared to the unpartitioned model of the entire road infrastructure.

Nonparametric methods, especially Machine Learning (ML)-based methods, compared to parametric methods, need less prior knowledge about the relationship among different traffic patterns and can better fit the non-linear features of traffic data. However, we notice that, due to the complex structure, ML-models require a higher cost of implementation regarding time consumption of training and predicting. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate not only the accuracy but also the efficiency and scalability of some state-of-the-art ML-models, which is the key to apply a prediction model into the real world.

Intersections are the most complex part of the road network, as they involve various participants, such as vehicles and pedestrians. Therefore, providing an accurate traffic flow prediction model will enhance traffic efficiency and reduce common problems, such as accidents, congestion and air pollution. However, there are two challenges in the traffic flow prediction problem: first, traffic is a dynamic nonlinear problem due to nonrecurrent events, such as accidents and roadworks, that occur near intersections as an unexpected event will impact the accuracy of the prediction method. The second challenge is that there is a large amount of data which needs a scalable model to efficiently handle big data. To overcome the first issue, in this study, accidents and roadworks data are used, in addition to sensor data that are updated in real time. The datasets are published by VicRoads for the state of Victoria, Australia.

In this paper, we have developed a smart vehicle access control system considering a wide variety of plate formations and styles for different Asian and European countries and presented novel deep learning based ANPR pipeline that can be used for heterogeneous number plates. The presented improved ANPR pipeline detects vehicle front/rear view and subsequently localizes the number plate area using the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) object detection models. Further, an algorithm identifies the unique plate layout, which is either a single or double row layout in different countries, and the last step in the pipeline is to recognize the number plate label using a deep learning architecture (i.e., AlexNet or R-CNNL3). The results show that our trained YOLOv4 model for vehicle front/rear view detection achieves a 98.42&#x0025; mAP score, and the number plate localization model achieves a 99.71&#x0025; mAP score on a 0.50 threshold.

However, incomplete traffic time-series data during the data analysis are nearly inevitable due to the constraints of data collection or packet loss in the communication process. Existing tensor-based completion methods fail to perform well in consecutively missing (CM) cases where a sub-series of the traffic time series is completely missing. Moreover, their high computational complexity prevents the road network-level implementation. Therefore, to tackle these problems, a batch-oriented traffic data completion method for large-scale road networks is proposed in this paper. In order to preserve multi-way natures of traffic data, we first model the traffic data by tensors so that traffic data completion becomes a tensor completion problem. Several types of tensor structures are adopted in order to analyze their impacts on traffic data completion. Thereafter, a Content-Aware traffic data completion method is further developed based on the Generative Adversarial Net (CA-GAN). More specifically, the formulated traffic tensors are interpreted as samples from a high-dimensional traffic distribution and a GAN is then proposed to learn this distribution. By considering effects of traffic data from different days and links, a weighted loss function is employed to search for the raw traffic tensor in the obtained traffic distribution. Afterwards, the estimated raw traffic tensor is used to complete the missing data. Visualization results demonstrate that our GANs can produce verisimilar traffic patterns with different time spans. Finally, our experiments on real traffic datasets show that the proposed CA-GAN method can effectively batch incomplete traffic tensors in CM cases with fast recovery process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9133309/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Nowadays, ITS applications are becoming more data-intensive and their data are described using the “5Vs of Big Data”. Thus, to fully utilize such data, big data analytics need to be applied. The Internet of vehicles (IoV) connects the ITS devices to cloud computing centres, where data processing is performed. However, transferring huge amount of data from geographically distributed devices creates network overhead and bottlenecks, and it consumes the network resources. In addition, following the centralized approach to process the ITS big data results in high latency which cannot be tolerated by the delay-sensitive ITS applications. Fog computing is considered a promising technology for real-time big data analytics. Basically, the fog technology complements the role of cloud computing and distributes the data processing at the edge of the network, which provides faster responses to ITS application queries and saves the network resources.

Although connectivity and automation are projected to bring about a vast number of benefits, they can give rise to new challenges in terms of safety, security, and privacy. To navigate roadways, CAVs need to heavily rely on their sensor readings and the information received from other vehicles and roadside units. Hence, anomalous sensor readings caused by either malicious cyber attacks or faulty vehicle sensors can result in disruptive consequences and possibly lead to fatal crashes. As a result, before the mass implementation of CAVs, it is important to develop methodologies that can detect anomalies and identify their sources seamlessly and in real time.

In the literature, recent efforts have applied various deep learning methods for traffic forecasting, e.g., leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for spatial dependency modeling, and utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for capturing temporal dynamics. However, most of the existing approaches assume that spatial correlations are static and temporal correlations have only sequential dependencies and do not consider temporal periodicity of traffic across multiple time steps. The real challenge lies in using the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations while also considering the influence of the nontraffic-related factors, such as time-of-day and weekday-or-weekend in the learning architectures. We propose a novel framework titled “reinforced spatial-temporal attention graph (RSTAG) neural networks” for traffic prediction. Our method captures dynamic spatial correlations through diffusion network graphs, while temporal dependencies are represented through the sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism. In addition, we utilize the policy gradient to update the model parameters while largely alleviating the exposure bias issue that exists in previous traffic prediction models.

Meanwhile, these ensemble methods often use many base models for regression. Thus, the performances of these existing methods are worth exploring for multi-step traffic forecasts with few base models. Besides, this paper proposes a model based on ensemble models, called “Triplet Decoders Neural Network” (TDNN), to compare with these methods. By analyzing the characteristic of traffic speed data, this paper also proposes a data preprocessing model called “T-Conversion” to help RNN capturing long-term dependencies.
