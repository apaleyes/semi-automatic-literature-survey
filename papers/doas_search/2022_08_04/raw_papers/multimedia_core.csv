Here we describe Warp, a software that automates all preprocessing steps of cryo-EM data acquisition and enables real-time evaluation. Warp corrects micrographs for global and local motion, estimates the local defocus and monitors key parameters for each recorded micrograph or tomographic tilt series in real time. The software further includes deep-learning-based models for accurate particle picking and image denoising. The output from Warp can be fed into established programs for particle classification and 3D-map refinement.

213372873,2019-05-29T00:00:00,"International audienceThis paper describes the principles and implementation results of reinforcement learning algorithms on IoT devices for radio collision mitigation in ISM unlicensed bands. Learning is here used to improve both the IoT network capability to support a larger number of objects as well as the autonomy of IoT devices. We first illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in a proof-of-concept based on USRP software radio platforms operating on real radio signals. It shows how collisions with other RF signals present in the ISM band are diminished for a given IoT device. Then we describe the first implementation of learning algorithms on LoRa devices operating in a real LoRaWAN network, that we named IoTligent. The proposed solution adds neither processing overhead so that it can be ran in the IoT devices, nor network overhead so that no change is required to LoRaWAN. Real life experiments have been done in a realistic LoRa network and they show that IoTligent device battery life can be extended by a factor 2 in the scenarios we faced during our experiment.L'article décrit les principes et les résultats de la mise en œuvre d'algorithmes d'apprentissage par renforcement sur des appareils de l'Internet des Objets pour l'atténuation des collisions radio dans les bandes non licenciées ISM.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation.

237173517,2019,"In this paper we investigate the impact of a social robot in the context of serious games in which the robot plays the role of a game opponent by challenging and, at the same time, teaching the child to correctly recycle waste materials. To this aim we performed a study in which we investigated the dimensions that are used to evaluate serious games integrated with those that are typical of the interaction with a social robot. To endow the robot with the capability to play as a game opponent in a real-world context, we implemented an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network so that the robot could detect and classify the waste material as a child would do, by seeing it. After a preliminary evaluation of the approach, we started a formal experiment in which we measured the effectiveness of game design, the robot evaluation and the evaluation of cognitive and affective elements that can form the pro-environmental attitude and then the tendency to recycling. A primary school classroom was involved in the study and, results obtained so far, are encouraging and drew promising possibilities for robotics education in changing recycling attitude for children since Pepper is positively evaluated as trustful and believable and this allowed to be concentrated on the ‘memorization’ task during the game",IEEE Computer Society,Investigating the Social Robots’ Role in Improving Children Attitudes toward Recycling.

390009408,2020-02-20T00:00:00,"Methods of machine intelligence with training contribute their specifics to the creation and commissioning of a gaming system.One of the main problems is the need to anticipate the entire set of input situations and possible answers at the time of design and the impossibility of expanding their list withoutretraining. This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.Методы машинного интеллекта с обучением вносят свою специфику к созданию и наладке игровой системы.Одна из главных проблем — это необходимость предвидения всего набора входных ситуаций и возможных ответов на моменте проектирования и невозможность расширения их списка без переобучения.

251215068,2019-08-01T00:00:00,"PURPOSE: The use of neural networks to directly predict three-dimensional dose distributions for automatic planning is becoming popular. However, the existing methods use only patient anatomy as input and assume consistent beam configuration for all patients in the training database. The purpose of this work was to develop a more general model that considers variable beam configurations in addition to patient anatomy to achieve more comprehensive automatic planning with a potentially easier clinical implementation, without the need to train specific models for different beam settings. METHODS: The proposed anatomy and beam (AB) model is based on our newly developed deep learning architecture, and hierarchically densely connected U-Net (HD U-Net), which combines U-Net and DenseNet. The AB model contains 10 input channels: one for beam setup and the other 9 for anatomical information (PTV and organs). The beam setup information is represented by a 3D matrix of the non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. We used a set of images from 129 patients with lung cancer treated with IMRT with heterogeneous beam configurations (4-9 beams of various orientations) for training/validation (100 patients) and testing (29 patients). Mean squared error was used as the loss function. We evaluated the model's accuracy by comparing the mean dose, maximum dose, and other relevant dose-volume metrics for the predicted dose distribution against those of the clinically delivered dose distribution. Dice similarity coefficients were computed to address the spatial correspondence of the isodose volumes between the predicted and clinically delivered doses. The model was also compared with our previous work, the anatomy only (AO) model, which does not consider beam setup information and uses only 9 channels for anatomical information. RESULTS: The AB model outperformed the AO model, especially in the low and medium dose regions. In terms of dose-volume metrics, AB outperformed AO by about 1-2%. The largest improvement was found to be about 5% in lung volume receiving a dose of 5Gy or more (V5 ). The improvement for spinal cord maximum dose was also important, that is, 3.6% for cross-validation and 2.6% for testing. The AB model achieved Dice scores for isodose volumes as much as 10% higher than the AO model in low and medium dose regions and about 2-5% higher in high dose regions. CONCLUSIONS: The AO model, which does not use beam configuration as input, can still predict dose distributions with reasonable accuracy in high dose regions but introduces large errors in low and medium dose regions for IMRT cases with variable beam numbers and orientations. The proposed AB model outperforms the AO model substantially in low and medium dose regions, and slightly in high dose regions, by considering beam setup information through a cumulative non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. This new model represents a major step forward towards predicting 3D dose distributions in real clinical practices, where beam configuration could vary from patient to patient, from planner to planner, and from institution to institution.status: publishe",'Wiley',Three-dimensional dose prediction for lung IMRT patients with deep neural networks: robust learning from heterogeneous beam configurations,10.1002/mp.13597,,"[{'title': 'Medical Physics', 'identifiers': ['issn:0094-2405', 'issn:2473-4209', '0094-2405', '2473-4209']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This special issue contains four papers dealing with architectures and design methodologies to support embedded intelligence, but also providing best practices and software support.



The paper “A Technologically Agnostic Framework for Cyber-Physical and IoT Processing-in-Memory-based Systems Simulation”, by Santos et al., aims to focus on Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a solution for efficiently processing big data. In particular, this work presents a framework to simulate and automatically generate code for IoT PIM-based systems. Moreover, it proposes an high speed and energy efficient architecture for an IoT PIM system, able to compute a real image recognition application.



The paper “Recommender system implementations for embedded collaborative filtering applications”, by Pajuelo-Holguera et al., aims to propose a complete recommender system implemented on reconfigurable hardware with the purpose of testing on-chip, low-energy embedded collaborative filtering applications. The proposed approach solves any prediction problem based on collaborative filtering by using an off-line, highly-portable light computing environment. Moreover, this work exploits a custom, fine-grained parallel circuit for quick matrix multiplication with floating-point numbers.



The paper “SystemC-based Electronic System-Level Design Space Exploration Environment for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems”, by Pomante et al., faces the problem of the Electronic System-Level (ESL) HW/SW co-design of dedicated electronic digital systems based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures. In particular, the work presents a prototype SystemC -based environment that exploits a Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach able to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the system specification and a mapping onto an automatically defined architecture.



The paper “A Fast and Scalable Architecture to Run Convolutional Neural Networks in Low Density FPGAs”, by Véstias et al., deals with efficient configurable architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) inference targeting any density FPGAs. The architecture exploits fixed-point arithmetic and image batch to reduce computational, memory and memory bandwidth requirements without compromising network accuracy.



In conclusion, this special issue offers some timely contributions to advance the research of intelligent embedded systems by analyzing both architectures and applications. All of four papers are worth reading and will inspire more interesting ideas and research topics.

268992296,2019-07-01,"Multimedia sensors enable monitoring applications to obtain more accurate and detailed information. However, the development of efficient and lightweight solutions for managing data traffic over wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) has become vital because of the excessive volume of data produced by multimedia sensors. As part of this motivation, this paper proposes a fusion-based WMSN framework that reduces the amount of data to be transmitted over the network by intra-node processing. This framework explores three main issues: 1) the design of a wireless multimedia sensor (WMS) node to detect objects using machine learning techniques; 2) a method for increasing the accuracy while reducing the amount of information transmitted by the WMS nodes to the base station, and; 3) a new cluster-based routing algorithm for the WMSNs that consumes less power than the currently used algorithms. In this context, a WMS node is designed and implemented using commercially available components. In order to reduce the amount of information to be transmitted to the base station and thereby extend the lifetime of a WMSN, a method for detecting and classifying objects on three different layers has been developed.

480201885,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The increasing digitalization and advancement in information communication technologies has greatly changed how humans interact with digital information. Nowadays, it is not sufficient to only display relevant data in production activities, as the enormous amount of data generated from smart devices can overwhelm operators without being fully utilized. Operators often require extensive knowledge of the machines in use to make informed decisions during processes such as maintenance and production. To enable novice operators to access such knowledge, it is important to reinvent the way of interacting with digitally enhanced smart devices. In this research, a mobile augmented reality remote monitoring system is proposed to help operators with low knowledge and experience level comprehend digital twin data of a device and interact with the device. It analyses both historic logs as well as real-time data through a cloud server and enriches 2D data with 3D models and animations in the 3D physical space. A cloud-based machine learning algorithm is applied to transform learned knowledge into live presentations on a mobile device for users to interact with. A scaled-down case study is conducted using a tower crane model to demonstrate the potential benefits as well as implications when the system is deployed in industrial environments. This user study verifies that the proposed solution yields consistent measurable improvements for novice users in human-device interaction that is statistically significant",'MDPI AG',An Integrated Mobile Augmented Reality Digital Twin Monitoring System,10.3390/computers10080099,,"[{'title': 'Computers', 'identifiers': ['issn:2073-431X', '2073-431x']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429686511,2020-03-25T00:00:00,"We present a deep learning-based multitask framework for joint 3D human pose estimation and action recognition from RGB sensors using simple cameras. The approach proceeds along two stages. In the first, a real-time 2D pose detector is run to determine the precise pixel location of important keypoints of the human body. A two-stream deep neural network is then designed and trained to map detected 2D keypoints into 3D poses. In the second stage, the Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithm is deployed to find an optimal network architecture that is used for modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of the estimated 3D poses via an image-based intermediate representation and performing action recognition. Experiments on Human3.6M, MSR Action3D and SBU Kinect Interaction datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the targeted tasks. Moreover, we show that the method requires a low computational budget for training and inference. In particular, the experimental results show that by using a monocular RGB sensor, we can develop a 3D pose estimation and human action recognition approach that reaches the performance of RGB-depth sensors. This opens up many opportunities for leveraging RGB cameras (which are much cheaper than depth cameras and extensively deployed in private and public places) to build intelligent recognition systems.Sergio A.

491193342,2022-01-31T01:52:07,"The history of medicine shows that myocardial infarction is one of the significant causes of death in humans. The rapid evolution in autonomous technologies, the rise of computer vision, and edge computing offers intriguing possibilities in healthcare monitoring systems. The major motivation of the work is to improve the survival rate during a cardiac arrest through an automatic emergency recognition system under ambient intelligence. We present a novel approach to chest pain and fall posture-based vital sign detection using an intelligence surveillance camera to address the emergency during myocardial infarction. A real-time embedded solution persuaded from ""edge AI""is implemented using the state-of-the-art convolution neural networks: single shot detector Inception V2, single shot detector MobileNet V2, and Internet of Things embedded GPU platform NVIDIA's Jetson Nano. The deep learning algorithm is implemented for 3000 indoor color image datasets: Nanyang Technological University Red Blue Green and Depth, NTU RGB + D dataset, and private RMS dataset. The research mainly pivots on two key factors in creating and training a CNN model to detect the vital signs and evaluate its performance metrics.

287167378,2020-01-22T00:00:00,"In this article, I review the concept of algorithmic generative and interactive music and discuss the advantages and challenges of its implementation in videogames. Excessive repetition caused by low interactivity in music sequences through gameplay has been tackled primarily by using random or sequential containers, coupled with overlapping rules and adaptive mix parameters, as demonstrated in the Dynamic Music Units in Audiokinetic’s Wwise middleware. This approach provides a higher variety through re-combinatorial properties of music tracks and also a responsive and interactive music stream. However, it mainly uses prerecorded music sequences that reappear and are easy to recognize throughout gameplay. Generative principles such as single-seed design have been occasionally applied in game music scoring to generate material. Some of them are complemented with rules and are assigned to sections with low emotional requirements, but support for real-time interaction in gameplay situations, although desirable, is rarely found.While algorithmic note-by-note generation can offer interactive flexibility and infinite diversity, it poses significant challenges such as achieving human-like performativity and producing a distinctive narrative style through measurable parameters or program arguments. Starting with music generation, I examine conceptual implementations and technical challenges of algorithmic composition studies that use Markov models, a-life/evolutionary music, generative grammars, agents, and artificial neural networks/deep learning. For each model, I evaluate rule-based strategies for interactive music transformation using parameters provided by contextual gameplay situations. Finally, I propose a compositional tool design based in modular instances of algorithmic music generation, featuring stylistic interactive control in connection with an audio engine rendering system",'Aarhus University Library',Algorithmic interactive music generation in videogames: A modular design for adaptive automatic music scoring,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
524551330,2022-03-04T00:00:00,"The aim of this study was to investigate and assess parents' and teachers' views of the home-visiting program as a method of early childhood education during the COVID-19 outbreak. Exploratory qualitative research employed as methods of inquiry. Twelve resource persons were interviewed (3 teachers and 9 parents). The data revealed, parents and teachers perceive that using home visits has a number of benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are as follows: 1) more effective than online; 2) make learning materials easy for children to understand; 3) pique children's interest and excitement for learning; and 4) eliminate the need for parents to assist their children with their tasks. Meanwhile, the downsides include the following: 1) it was inconvenient for parents because they were needed to entertain teachers and other children; 2) some pupils couldn't study because home visits were far away from their homes.; 3) additional media and learning activities preparation; 4) additional time and energy was wasted; and 5) the risk of exposure to COVID-19 was increased. The researchers recommend that additional study be conducted with a larger and more diverse sample size in order to obtain a more complete picture of this issue.

Oggi, a Poggio del Molino è in corso la realizzazione di un Parco di Archeologica Condivisa (PArCo), il primo in Italia.

Forse in un mondo in cui i viaggiatori sono “cittadini temporanei”, attrarre un turismo consapevole unito alla capacità di generare valore sono le vere frontiere naturali e contemporanee dell’archeologia pubblica. This paper outlines the management strategy implemented by the cultural association Past in Progress over the archaeological area of Poggio del Molino near Populonia (Piombino, LI). Since 2008, Past in Progress’s model has achieved particular success at the international level, with more than 2,000 participants having taken an “active” share in archaeological experiences in the territory of Populonia. More recently at Poggio del Molino, developments have been initiated to transform the area into a “Shared Archaeology Park” (Parco di Archeologia Condivisa/PArCo), the first in Italy. Characterized by a diverse set of didactic, content-based, and experiential amenities, the PArCo will serve to structure authentic and “once-in-a-lifetime” experiences, responding to the needs of tourists, volunteers, and non-local visitors.

479627403,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Seed purity directly affects the quality of seed breeding and subsequent processing products. Seed sorting based on machine vision provides an effective solution to this problem. The deep learning technology, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have exhibited impressive performance in image recognition and classification, and have been proven applicable in seed sorting. However the huge computational complexity and massive storage requirements make it a great challenge to deploy them in real-time applications, especially on devices with limited resources. In this study, a rapid and highly efficient lightweight CNN based on visual attention, namely SeedSortNet, is proposed for seed sorting. First, a dual-branch lightweight feature extraction module Shield-block is elaborately designed by performing identity mapping, spatial transformation at higher dimensions and different receptive field modeling, and thus it can alleviate information loss and effectively characterize the multi-scale feature while utilizing fewer parameters and lower computational complexity. In the down-sampling layer, the traditional MaxPool is replaced as MaxBlurPool to improve the shift-invariant of the network. Also, an extremely lightweight sub-feature space attention module (SFSAM) is presented to selectively emphasize fine-grained features and suppress the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that SeedSortNet achieves the accuracy rates of 97.33% and 99.56% on the maize seed dataset and sunflower seed dataset, respectively, and outperforms the mainstream lightweight networks (MobileNetv2, ShuffleNetv2, etc.) at similar computational costs, with only 0.400M parameters (vs. 4.06M, 5.40M)",'PeerJ',SeedSortNet: a rapid and highly effificient lightweight CNN based on visual attention for seed sorting,10.7717/peerj-cs.639,,"[{'title': 'PeerJ Computer Science', 'identifiers': ['2376-5992', 'issn:2376-5992']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429033224,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.

479182827,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) is one of the technologies that provides high performance with a high density of connected devices to support emerging demanding services, such as virtual and augmented reality. However, in highly dense deployments, Wi-Fi performance is severely affected by interference. This problem is even worse in new standards, such as 802.11n/ac, where new features such as Channel Bonding (CB) are introduced to increase network capacity but at the cost of using wider spectrum channels. Finding the best channel assignment in dense deployments under dynamic environments with CB is challenging, given its combinatorial nature. Therefore, the use of analytical or system models to predict Wi-Fi performance after potential changes (e.g., dynamic channel selection with CB, and the deployment of new devices) are not suitable, due to either low accuracy or high computational cost. This paper presents a novel, data-driven approach to speed up this process, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that exploits the information carried in the deployment’s topology and the intricate wireless interactions to predict Wi-Fi performance with high accuracy. The evaluation results show that preserving the graph structure in the learning process obtains a 64% increase versus a naive approach, and around 55% compared to other Machine Learning (ML) approaches when using all training features",'MDPI AG',ATARI: A Graph Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Performance Prediction in Next-Generation WLANs,10.3390/s21134321,,"[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In order to overcome this limitation, solutions emerged, such as smart homes and wearable devices. Smart homes integrate sensors, actuators, and artificial intelligence to assist seniors in their everyday life. One of the objectives is to recognize the activities of everyday life. This recognition aims to provide the right assistance at the right moment and gives some autonomy to seniors.

Also, all the experiments have been conducted in a real apartment and are composed of 15 different activities.

La colorización plantea un reto específico en visión computarizada para la reconstrucción de imágenes y video, tales como, la búsqueda de una fiel aproximación, la saturación correcta de colores escogidos y áreas no desfasadas.
La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).

Cayena, nuestra aplicación web presenta una galería de imágenes de la historia de Barranquilla y de forma interactiva permite realizarles el coloreado. Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).

372560235,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"In the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen a massive improvement, outperforming other visual recognition algorithms. Since they are playing an increasingly important role in fields such as face recognition, augmented reality or autonomous driving, there is the growing need for a fast and efficient system to perform the redundant and heavy computations of CNNs. This trend led researchers towards heterogeneous systems provided with hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The vast majority of CNNs is implemented with floating-point parameters and operations, but from research, it has emerged that high classification accuracy can be obtained also by reducing the floating-point activations and weights to binary values. This context is well suitable for FPGAs, that are known to stand out in terms of performance when dealing with binary operations, as demonstrated in FINN, the state-of-the-art framework for building Binarized Neural Network (BNN) accelerators on FPGAs. In this paper, we propose a framework that extends FINN to a distributed scenario, enabling BNNs implementation on embedded multi-FPGA systems",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',BNNsplit: Binarized Neural Networks for embedded distributed FPGA-based computing systems,10.23919/DATE48585.2020.9116220,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479314553,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"One of the biggest challenges hindering a table tennis robot to play as well as a professional player is the ball&#x2019;s accurate motion control, which depends on various factors such as the incoming ball&#x2019;s position, linear, spin velocity and so forth. Unfortunately, some factors are almost impossible to be directly measured in real practice, such as the ball&#x2019;s spin velocity, which is difficult to be estimated from vision due to the little texture on the ball&#x2019;s surface. To perform accurate motion control in table tennis, this study proposes to learn a ball stroke strategy to guarantee desirable &#x201C;target landing location&#x201D; and the &#x201C;over-net height&#x201D; which are two key indicators to evaluate the quality of a stroke. To overcome the spin velocity challenge, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based stroke approach is developed with the spin velocity estimation capability, through which the system can predict the relative spin velocity of the ball and stroke it back accurately by iteratively learning from the robot-environment interactions. To pre-train the DRL-based strategy effectively, this paper develops a virtual table tennis playing environment, through which various simulated data can be collected. For the real table tennis robot implementation, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control strategy compared to that of the traditional aerodynamics-based method with an average landing error around 80mm and the landing-within-table probability higher than 70&#x0025;",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Ball Motion Control in the Table Tennis Robot System Using Time-Series Deep Reinforcement Learning,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093340,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

430688355,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background and objectiveDynamic muscle fascicle length measurements through B-mode ultrasound have become popular for the non-invasive physiological insights they provide regarding musculoskeletal structure-function. However, current practices typically require time consuming post-processing to track muscle length changes from B-mode images. A real-time measurement tool would not only save processing time but would also help pave the way toward closed-loop applications based on feedback signals driven by in vivo muscle length change patterns. In this paper, we benchmark an approach that combines traditional machine learning (ML) models with B-mode ultrasound recordings to obtain muscle fascicle length changes in real-time. To gauge the utility of this framework for 'in-the-loop' applications, we evaluate accuracy of the extracted muscle length change signals against time-series' derived from a standard, post-hoc automated tracking algorithm.MethodsWe collected B-mode ultrasound data from the soleus muscle of six participants performing five defined ankle motion tasks: (a) seated, constrained ankle plantarflexion, (b) seated, free ankle dorsi/plantarflexion, (c) weight-bearing, calf raises (d) walking, and then a (e) mix. We trained machine learning (ML) models by pairing muscle fascicle lengths obtained from standardized automated tracking software (UltraTrack) with the respective B-mode ultrasound image input to the tracker, frame-by-frame. Then we conducted hyperparameter optimizations for five different ML models using a grid search to find the best performing parameters for a combination of high correlation and low RMSE between ML and UltraTrack processed muscle fascicle length trajectories. Finally, using the global best model/hyperparameter settings, we comprehensively evaluated training-testing outcomes within subject (i.e., train and test on same subject), cross subject (i.e., train on one subject, test on another) and within/direct cross task (i.e., train and test on same subject, but different task).ResultsSupport vector machine (SVM) was the best performing model with an average r = 0.70 ±0.34 and average RMSE = 2.86 ±2.55 mm across all direct training conditions and average r = 0.65 ±0.35 and average RMSE = 3.28 ±2.64 mm when optimized for all cross-participant conditions. Comparisons between ML vs. UltraTrack (i.e., ground truth) tracked muscle fascicle length versus time data indicated that ML tracked images reliably capture the salient qualitative features in ground truth length change data, even when correlation values are on the lower end. Furthermore, in the direct training, calf raises condition, which is most comparable to previous studies validating automated tracking performance during isolated contractions on a dynamometer, our ML approach yielded 0.90 average correlation, in line with other accepted tracking methods in the field.ConclusionsBy combining B-mode ultrasound and classical ML models, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve real-time tracking of human soleus muscle fascicles across a number of functionally relevant contractile conditions.

However, the technique has been hampered by technical limitations due to massive data throughput requirements and nonlinear inverse search algorithms, limiting it to an offline technique where data must be postprocessed. Aim: To present an MELSCI system capable of continuous acquisition and processing of MELSCI data, enabling real-time video-rate perfusion imaging with high accuracy. Approach: The MELSCI algorithm was implemented in programmable hardware (field programmable gate array) closely interfaced to a high-speed CMOS sensor for real-time calculation. Perfusion images were estimated in real-time from the MELSCI data using an artificial neural network trained on simulated data. The MELSCI perfusion was compared to two existing single-exposure metrics both quantitatively in a controlled phantom experiment and qualitatively in vivo. Results: The MELSCI perfusion shows higher signal dynamics compared to both single-exposure metrics, both spatially and temporally where heartbeat-related variations are resolved in much greater detail. The MELSCI perfusion is less susceptible to measurement noise and is more linear with respect to laser Doppler perfusion in the phantom experiment (R-2 = 0.992). Conclusions: The presented MELSCI system allows for real-time acquisition and calculation of high-quality perfusion at 15.6 frames per second. (C) The Authors.

479360462,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Introduction. An important part of an automotive unmanned vehicle (UV) control system is the environment analysis module. This module is based on various types of sensors, e.g. video cameras, lidars and radars. The development of computer and video technologies makes it possible to implement an environment analysis module using a single video camera as a sensor. This approach is expected to reduce the cost of the entire module. The main task in video image processing is to analyse the environment as a 3D scene. The 3D trajectory of an object, which takes into account its dimensions, angle of view and movement vector, as well as the vehicle pose in a video image, provides sufficient information for assessing the real interaction of objects. A basis for constructing a 3D trajectory is vehicle pose estimation.Aim. To develop an automatic method for estimating vehicle pose based on video data analysis from a single video camera.Materials and methods. An automatic method for vehicle pose estimation from a video image was proposed based on a cascade approach. The method includes vehicle detection, key points determination, segmentation and vehicle pose estimation. Vehicle detection and determination of its key points were resolved via a neural network. The segmentation of a vehicle video image and its mask preparation were implemented by transforming it into a polar coordinate system and searching for the outer contour using graph theory.Results. The estimation of vehicle pose was implemented by matching the Fourier image of vehicle mask signatures and the templates obtained based on 3D models. The correctness of the obtained vehicle pose and angle of view estimation was confirmed by experiments based on the proposed method. The vehicle pose estimation had an accuracy of 89 % on an open Carvana image dataset.Conclusion. A new approach for vehicle pose estimation was proposed, involving the transition from end-to-end learning of neural networks to resolve several problems at once, e.g., localization, classification, segmentation, and angle of view, towards cascade analysis of information. The accuracy level of end-to-end learning requires large sets of representative data, which complicates the scalability of solutions for road environments in Russia. The proposed method makes it possible to estimate the vehicle pose with a high accuracy level, at the same time as involving no large costs for manual data annotation and training",'St. Petersburg Electrotechnical University LETI',Method for Automatic Determination of a 3D Trajectory of Vehicles in a Video Image,10.32603/1993-8985-2021-24-3-49-59,https://core.ac.uk/download/479360462.pdf,"[{'title': 'Journal of the Russian Universities Radioelectronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:1993-8985', '1993-8985', 'issn:2658-4794', '2658-4794']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
346367817,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, mm-Pose, a novel approach to detect and track human skeletons in real-time using an mmWave radar, is proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation. The proposed method was tested for a single human scenario for four primary motions, (i) Walking, (ii) Swinging left arm, (iii) Swinging right arm, and (iv) Swinging both arms to validate accurate predictions for motion in range, azimuth and elevation.

First, we describe the hardware and software solution employed to build the system. Second, we detail the machine learning methods used for the automatic recognition of the users' mental workload, which are based on the well-known Random Forest algorithm. In order to gather data to train the system, we conducted an extensive user study with 75 participants using a VR flight simulator to induce different levels of mental workload. In contrast to previous works which label the data based on a standardized task (e.g. n-back task) or on a pre-defined task-difficulty, participants were asked about their perceived mental workload level along the experiment. With the data collected, we were able to train the system in order to classify four different levels of mental workload with an accuracy up to 65%. In addition, we discuss the role of the signal normalization procedures, the contribution of the different physiological signals on the recognition accuracy and compare the results obtained with the sensors embedded in the HMD with commercial grade systems. Preliminary results show our pipeline is able to recognize mental workload in real-time. Taken together, our results suggest that such all-in-one approach, with physiological sensors directly embedded in the HMD, is a promising path for VR applications in which the real-time or off-line estimation of Mental Workload assessment is beneficial",HAL CCSD,Towards Real-Time Recognition of Users' Mental Workload Using Integrated Physiological Sensors Into a VR HMD,,https://core.ac.uk/download/362229766.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

480278110,2021-12-01T00:00:00,"Among the wide variety of malicious behavior commonly observed in modern social platforms, one of the most notorious is the diffusion of fake news, given its potential to influence the opinions of millions of people who can be voters, consumers, or simply citizens going about their daily lives. In this paper, we implement and carry out an empirical evaluation of a version of the recently-proposed NetDER architecture for hybrid AI decision-support systems with the capability of leveraging the availability of machine learning modules, logical reasoning about unknown objects, and forecasts based on diffusion processes. NetDER is a general architecture for reasoning about different kinds of malicious behavior such as dissemination of fake news, hate speech, and malware, detection of botnet operations, prevention of cyber attacks including those targeting software products or blockchain transactions, among others. Here, we focus on the case of fake news dissemination on social platforms by three different kinds of users: non-malicious, malicious, and botnet members. In particular, we focus on three tasks: (i) determining who is responsible for posting a fake news article, (ii) detecting malicious users, and (iii) detecting which users belong to a botnet designed to disseminate fake news. Given the difficulty of obtaining adequate data with ground truth, we also develop a testbed that combines real-world fake news datasets with synthetically generated networks of users and fully-detailed traces of their behavior throughout a series of time points. We designed our testbed to be customizable for different problem sizes and settings, and make its code publicly available to be used in similar evaluation efforts. Finally, we report on the results of a thorough experimental evaluation of three variants of our model and six environmental settings over the three tasks. Our results clearly show the effects that the quality of knowledge engineering tasks, the quality of the underlying machine learning classifier used to detect fake news, and the specific environmental conditions have on smart policing efforts in social platforms.Fil: Paredes, José Nicolás.

However, there is as yet no straightforward way to combine it with deep learning. In this paper, we therefore propose Neural Random Subspace (NRS), a novel deep learning based random subspace method.

Furthermore, as a non-linear component to be encoded into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), NRS learns non-linear feature representations in CNNs more efficiently than contemporary, higher-order pooling methods, producing excellent results with negligible increase in parameters, floating point operations (FLOPs) and real running time. Compared with random subspaces, random forests and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs), NRS demonstrates superior performance on 35 machine learning datasets.

Indeed, at the beginning of XXI century, the Spanish legislation has promptly responded to challenges posed by new biotechnologies and advances in genomics in the field of biomedical research by enacting in 2007 the Ley de Investigación Biomédica in order to keep up with the paradigm shift. Over the past 10 years, this Spanish framework along with the Real Decreto 1716/2011 has hold the merit to tackle the most controversial ethical issues related to use of human samples and personal data in biomedical research and biobanking (e.g. broad consent, secondary uses, governance, etc.). However, today the regulation of biomedical research and biobanks has to deal with big data, artificial intelligence and data-intensive research which have brought a number of challenges and controversies. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, I will analyse from an ethical point of view the merits of Spanish regulation on biobanking in order to draw some lessons for the still unregulated situation in other Member States. Secondly, I will discuss the big data paradigm shift in biomedical research and question if the ethical and legal framework introduced the Spanish law at the beginning of the century is still able to hold the ground with the new contextual and societal challenges. In this respect, I will identify some opportunities for implementation and suggest strategies to achieve them in the specific context of biobanks.En el panorama europeo, España representa un punto de referencia positivo en lo que respecta a la regulación de los biobancos.

In digital forensics domain, ML algorithms have been applied for cybercrime investigation such as child abuse investigations, malware classification, and image forensics. This paper addresses this issues and deals with forensic analysis of digital images and videos. In particular, this work aims at proposing a multimedia classification tool with a parallel software architecture for a fast inspection, which is easy to use (to be used by officers during a search), requires limited hardware resources and it is built on an open-source software to limit its costs. Moreover, this tool must be able to quickly inspect multiple devices at a time. When positives are found in a device, such device will be seized for a deeper analysis later in the lab. It will not be seized otherwise, reducing the inconvenience for the suspect as well as the time required for the next analysis phase. As a case study, we focus on the identification of child pornography images. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is capable of guaranteeing a high recall, a fast process and high performances in real scenarios.noneSpalazzi L.; Paolanti M.; Frontoni E.Spalazzi, L.; Paolanti, M.; Frontoni, E",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An offline parallel architecture for forensic multimedia classification,10.1007/s11042-021-10819-x,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Yet, in language and literacy teaching, little is known about using AR to enhance inquiry learning, and to encourage students to experiment with affordances of new media to develop critical and creative knowledge. Although teachers are expected to support students in learning, both with and through new digital forms, there is a slow uptake of new media, such as AR, in Australian contexts. This is possibly due to a lack of mainstream understanding about what AR is and what educational affordances it offers. The lack of classroom research and a “conceptual framework regarding the implementation of technologies such as Augmented Reality system” remain an impeding factor to effective explorations of AR in education (Bower et al., 2014, p.7)","Marrickville, N.S.W., Primary English Teaching Association Australia","Teaching language, literacy and literature using augmented reality : an introduction to AR apps and their potential for classroom use",,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322656801,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In any water utility, a reliable assessment of the service life of the network pipes is a key piece within the big puzzle of assets management. This paper presents a new statistical model (basic pipes life assessment, BPLA) to assess the service life of pipes, to locate the pipes on the failures bath curve and to forecast the expected failures in future years. Its main novelties are the processing of pipe information (is that information what is adapted to the classical maintenance engineering and not the other way back) and the definition of two different time variables that can be analyzed in parallel. The first novelty makes the model less demanding in terms of data and software tools than others currently available, and the second one allows to get all the results after one single stage of calculation. To show its usability, the BPLA has been applied to a pipe network that supplies water to 500,000 citizens for which two years of failure records are available. Procedures and results have been compared to the well-known Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM), with final relative errors lower than 10% and 15% on each particular result.The authors would like to thank Global Omnium for the support provided, both directly and through the Catedra Aguas de Valencia of the UPV, for the development of the works presented in this paper.Ramírez-Aguilar, RX.; López Jiménez, PA.; Torres Toro, D.; Cobacho Jordán, R.

395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

This approach uses vector motion-based signatures to describe the visual content and uses machine learning techniques to extract key frames for rapid browsing and efficient video indexing. The proposed method has been implemented on both single machine and real-time distributed cluster to evaluate the real-time performance aspect, especially when the number and size of videos are large.

Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria. The study identified 4.0IR drivers to include; robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 3D printing drones that are built with an attached 3D printer, (the drone hangs a 3D printing nozzle that's fed plastic, concrete mix or other material from a tube connected to the top of the drone's printing path that precisely plotted by software, for a promised printing accuracy of 0.1mm),and digital engineering. This study emanated from the government reports and past studies in the area of road transport asset management practice which the study investigated the major causes of poor practices and assessed the effect of the fourth industrial revolution on the practice",,Effect of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on Road Transport Asset Management Practice in Nigeria,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Presently, many window optimization techniques have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources, such as CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally intensive deep neural network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at high-end (or cloud) nodes. This article presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage allied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud paradigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the query and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching. VID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video inference process across nodes. This article proposes a novel content-driven microbatch resizing , query-aware caching, and microbatch-based utility filtering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to improve the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive evaluations are performed over five real-world data sets. The experimental results show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves &#8764;2.3× higher throughput with minimal latency and ~99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines while maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',VID-WIN: Fast video event matching with query-aware windowing at the edge for the internet of multimedia things,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Its diagnosis nowadays commonly includes performing an MRI scan, as it is the most sensitive imaging test for MS. MS plaques are commonly identified from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images as hyperintense regions that are highly varying in terms of their shapes, sizes and locations, and are routinely classified in accordance to the McDonald criteria. Recent years have seen an increase in works that aimed at development of various semi-automatic and automatic methods for detection, segmentation and classification of MS plaques. In this paper, we present an automatic combined method, based on two pipelines: a traditional unsupervised machine learning technique and a deep-learning attention-gate 3D U-net network. The deep-learning network is specifically trained to address the weaker points of the traditional approach, namely difficulties in segmenting infratentorial and juxtacortical plaques in real-world clinical MRIs. It was trained and validated on a multi-center multi-scanner dataset that contains 159 cases, each with T1 weighted (T1w) and FLAIR images, as well as manual delineations of the MS plaques, segmented and validated by a panel of raters. The detection rate was quantified using lesion-wise Dice score. A simple label fusion is implemented to combine the output segmentations of the two pipelines. This combined method improves the detection of infratentorial and juxtacortical lesions by 14% and 31% respectively, in comparison to the unsupervised machine learning pipeline that was used as a performance assessment baseline",'Elsevier BV',icobrain ms 5.1: Combining unsupervised and supervised approaches for improving the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions,10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102707,,"[{'title': 'NeuroImage Clinical', 'identifiers': ['2213-1582', 'issn:2213-1582']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, most of the existing platforms to interface algorithms with 3D environments are often designed to setup navigation-related experiments, to study physical interactions, or to handle ad-hoc cases that are not thought to be customized, sometimes lacking a strong photorealistic appearance and an easy-to-use software interface. In this paper, we present a novel platform, SAILenv, that is specifically designed to be simple and customizable, and that allows researchers to experiment visual recognition in virtual 3D scenes. A few lines of code are needed to interface every algorithm with the virtual world, and non-3D-graphics experts can easily customize the 3D environment itself, exploiting a collection of photorealistic objects. Our framework yields pixel-level semantic and instance labeling, depth, and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only one that provides motion-related information directly inherited from the 3D engine. The client-server communication operates at a low level, avoiding the overhead of HTTP-based data exchanges. We perform experiments using a state-of-the-art object detector trained on real-world images, showing that it is able to recognize the photorealistic 3D objects of our environment. The computational burden of the optical flow compares favourably with the estimation performed using modern GPU-based convolutional networks or more classic implementations.

We used the RTPVR method to measure ventricular geometry, ES pressure area relationship (ESPAR) and ESPVR during vena cava occlusion (VCO) in normal sheep. 14 adult sheep were anesthetized and underwent measurement of LV systolic function. Ten of the 14 sheep underwent RTMRI and eight of the 14 underwent measurement with conductance catheter; 4 had both RTMRI and conductance measurements. 2D cross sectional RTMRI were performed at apex, mid-ventricle and base levels during separate VCOs. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to compare LSSPM and manual image segmentation and thus determine LSSPM accuracy. LV cross-sectional area, major and minor axis length, axis ratio, major axis orientation angle and ESPAR were measured at each LV level. ESPVR was calculated with a trapezoidal rule. The Dice similarity coefficient between LSSPM and manual segmentation by two readers was 87.31±2.51% and 88.13±3.43%. All cross sections became more elliptical during VCO. The major axis orientation shifted during VCO but remained in the septo-lateral direction. LV chamber obliteration at the apical level occurred during VCO in 7 of 10 sheep that underwent RTMRI. ESPAR was non-linear at all levels. Finally, ESPVR was non-linear because of apical collapse. ESPVR measured by conductance catheter (EES,Index = 2.23±0.66 mmHg/ml/m2) and RT (EES,Index = 2.31±0.31 mmHg/ml/m2) was not significantly different.

Dozens of free and open cores developed based on this instruction set architecture have been released, and RISC-V based devices optimized for specific applications such as the IoT and wearables, embedded systems, AI, and virtual, augmented reality are emerging. As the RISC-V cores are being used in various fields, the demand for multicore platforms composed of RISC-V cores is also rapidly increasing. Although there are various RISC-V cores developed for each specific application, and it seems possible to pick them up to create the most optimized multicore for the target application, unfortunately it is very difficult to realize this in reality. This is mainly because most open cores are released in the form of a single core without cache coherence logic, which requires expensive design effort and development costs to address it. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method to solve the cache coherence problem without additional effort from the developer and to maximize the performance of the multicore composed of the RISC-V core selected by the developer. Along with a description of the sophisticated operating mechanisms of the proposed method, this paper details the architecture and hardware implementation of the proposed method.

Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions. One reason may be fragility in treating properly unexpected or perturbed data. The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations. A systematic approach is proposed for artificially injecting perturbations in the data and for evaluating the robustness of the models. This approach focuses on two perturbations that are likely to happen during data collection. Our experimental study, conducted on twenty sensors’ datasets from the public University of California Riverside (UCR) repository, shows a great disparity of the models’ robustness under data quality degradation. Those results are used to analyse whether the impact of such robustness can be predictable—thanks to decision trees—which would prevent us from testing all perturbations scenarios.

This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios.

The presented methodology consists of a first semantic segmentation phase, aiming at the automatic recognition through AI of architectural elements of historic buildings within points clouds; a Random Forest classifier is used for the classification task, evaluating each time the performance of the predictive model. At a second stage, visual programming techniques are applied to the reconstruction of a conceptual mock-up of each detected element and to the subsequent propagation of the 3D information to other objects with similar characteristics.

480201700,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Deepfake and manipulated digital photos and videos are being increasingly used in a myriad of cybercrimes. Ransomware, the dissemination of fake news, and digital kidnapping-related crimes are the most recurrent, in which tampered multimedia content has been the primordial disseminating vehicle. Digital forensic analysis tools are being widely used by criminal investigations to automate the identification of digital evidence in seized electronic equipment. The number of files to be processed and the complexity of the crimes under analysis have highlighted the need to employ efficient digital forensics techniques grounded on state-of-the-art technologies. Machine Learning (ML) researchers have been challenged to apply techniques and methods to improve the automatic detection of manipulated multimedia content. However, the implementation of such methods have not yet been massively incorporated into digital forensic tools, mostly due to the lack of realistic and well-structured datasets of photos and videos. The diversity and richness of the datasets are crucial to benchmark the ML models and to evaluate their appropriateness to be applied in real-world digital forensics applications. An example is the development of third-party modules for the widely used Autopsy digital forensic application. This paper presents a dataset obtained by extracting a set of simple features from genuine and manipulated photos and videos, which are part of state-of-the-art existing datasets. The resulting dataset is balanced, and each entry comprises a label and a vector of numeric values corresponding to the features extracted through a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The dataset is available in a GitHub repository, and the total amount of photos and video frames is 40,588 and 12,400, respectively. The dataset was validated and benchmarked with deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods; however, a plethora of other existing ones can be applied. Generically, the results show a better F1-score for CNN when comparing with SVM, both for photos and videos processing. CNN achieved an F1-score of 0.9968 and 0.8415 for photos and videos, respectively. Regarding SVM, the results obtained with 5-fold cross-validation are 0.9953 and 0.7955, respectively, for photos and videos processing. A set of methods written in Python is available for the researchers, namely to preprocess and extract the features from the original photos and videos files and to build the training and testing sets. Additional methods are also available to convert the original PKL files into CSV and TXT, which gives more flexibility for the ML researchers to use the dataset on existing ML frameworks and tools",'MDPI AG',A Dataset of Photos and Videos for Digital Forensics Analysis Using Machine Learning Processing,10.3390/data6080087,,"[{'title': 'Data', 'identifiers': ['2306-5729', 'issn:2306-5729']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478762593,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Image segmentation is an important research in image processing and machine vision in which automated driving can be seen the main application scene of image segmentation algorithms. Due to the many constraints of power supply and communication in in-vehicle systems, the vast majority of current image segmentation algorithms are implemented based on the deep learning model. Despite the ultrahigh segmentation accuracy, the problem of mesh artifacts and segmentation being too severe is obvious, and the high cost, computational, and power consumption devices required are difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. It is the focus of this paper to construct a road scene segmentation model with simple structure and no need of large computing power under the premise of certain accuracy. In this paper, the ESPNet (Efficient Spatial Pyramid of Dilated Convolutions for Semantic Segmentation) model is introduced in detail. On this basis, an improved ESPNet model is proposed based on ESPNet. Firstly, the network structure of the ESPNet model is optimized, and then, the model is optimized by using a small amount of weakly labeled and unlabeled scene sample data. Finally, the new model is applied to video image segmentation based on dash cam. It is verified on Cityscape, PASCAL VOC 2012, and other datasets that the algorithm proposed in this paper is faster, and the amount of parameters required is less than 1% of other algorithms, so it is suitable for mobile terminals",'Hindawi Limited',The Segmentation of Road Scenes Based on Improved ESPNet Model,10.1155/2021/1681952,,"[{'title': 'Security and Communication Networks', 'identifiers': ['issn:1939-0122', '1939-0122']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By the time of this article, most states have mandated face masking in public space. Therefore, real-time face mask detection becomes an essential application to prevent the spread of the pandemic. This study will present a face mask detection system that can detect and monitor mask-wearing from camera feeds and alert when there is a violation. The face mask detection algorithm uses a haar cascade classifier to find facial features from the camera feed and then utilizes it to detect the mask-wearing status. With the increasing number of cases all over the world, a system to replace humans to check masks on the faces of people is greatly needed. This system satisfies that need. This system can be employed in public places like transport stations and malls. It will be of great help in companies and huge establishments where there will be a lot of workers.   Alongside this, we have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output the presence or absence of a face mask in an image or a video stream. Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data with 100 percent and 99 percent precision and recall, respectively. We are making a savvy framework that will identify whether the specific user has worn the mask or not and further tell the accuracy level of the detection. Our framework will be python and AI-based which will be safe and quick for implementation.  This system will be of great help there because it is easy to obtain and store the data of the employees working in that Company and will very easily find the people who are not wearing the mask and a will be  sent to that respective person to take Precautions not wearing a mask. Potential delays are analyzed, and efforts are made to reduce them to achieve real-time detection. The experiment result shows that the presented system achieves a real-time 45fps 720p Video output, with a face mask detection response of 0.15s and the accuracy of detection 99%.

of the study is a 3D simulator that reproduces a virtual FabLab in which users can approach and

a structured-light camera acquires the face of the participant in real-time, to catch its spontaneous

overcoming some intrinsic limits in the adoption of questioning methods, such as the non-sincerity

of the interviewees and the lack of correspondence with facial expressions and body language.

expression recognition and the classification of the video frames in three classes of engagement

However, fast and accurate inference for processes of complex systems cannot easily be achieved in real-time with state-of-the-art methods under noisy real-world conditions with the requirement of a real-time response. The primary reason is that the inference of model parameters with traditional techniques based on optimization or sampling often suffers from computational and statistical challenges, resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and deployment time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and evaluated on two different physics-based models of turbofan engines.

This RA interacts with smart objects deployed at home, which are associated with the activity under observation (desk and chair). This solution allows therapists to receive more accurate information about the homework sessions inside the home. At the same time, remote interaction with the child is made possible (through the RA) to provide new instructions and support him/her along with the sessions.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources, and to represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, the current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multi-tier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs which is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge was developed, which integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysing, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learnt and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices.

The approach proceeds along two stages. In the first, a real-time 2D pose detector is run to determine the precise pixel location of important keypoints of the human body. A two-stream deep neural network is then designed and trained to map detected 2D keypoints into 3D poses. In the second stage, the Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithm is deployed to find an optimal network architecture that is used for modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of the estimated 3D poses via an image-based intermediate representation and performing action recognition. Experiments on Human3.6M, MSR Action3D and SBU Kinect Interaction datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the targeted tasks. Moreover, we show that the method requires a low computational budget for training and inference. In particular, the experimental results show that by using a monocular RGB sensor, we can develop a 3D pose estimation and human action recognition approach that reaches the performance of RGB-depth sensors.

477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R).

478204378,2021-08-26T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods & Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of > 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P < 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,10.22456/1679-9216.111167,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As laboratory tests consume much time, and existing field tests have excessive limitations, a more comprehensive method is in great need. This is the first time a study proposes machine learning algorithms for real-time gutter oil detection under multiple feature dimensions. Moreover, it is deployed on FPGA to be low-power and portable for actual use. Firstly, a variety of oil samples are generated by simulating the real detection environment. Next, based on previous studies, sensors are used to collect significant features that help distinguish gutter oil. Then, the acquired features are filtered and compared using a variety of classifiers. The best classification result is obtained by k-NN with an accuracy of 97.18%, and the algorithm is deployed to FPGA with no significant loss of accuracy. Power consumption is further reduced with the approximate multiplier we designed.

Real-time intelligent video processing on embedded devices with low power consumption can be useful for applications like drone surveillance, smart cars, and more. However, the limited resources of embedded devices is a challenging issue for effective embedded computing. Most of the existing work on this topic focuses on single device based solutions, without the use of cloud computing mechanisms for parallel processing to boost performance. In this paper, we propose a cloud platform for real-time video processing based on embedded devices. Eight NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and three Jetson TX2 GPUs are used to construct a streaming embedded cloud platform (SECP), on which Apache Storm is deployed as the cloud computing environment for deep learning algorithms (Convolutional Neural Networks — CNNs) to process video streams. Additionally, self-managing services are designed to ensure that this platform can run smoothly and stably, in the form of a metric sensor, a bottleneck detector and a scheduler. This platform is evaluated in terms of processing speed, power consumption, and network throughput by running various deep learning algorithms for object detection. The results show the proposed platform can run deep learning algorithms on embedded devices while meeting the high scalability and fault tolerance required for real-time video processing",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',A streaming cloud platform for real-time video processing on embedded devices,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The gradient non-linearity (GNL) induced distortions in MRI; however, hinder the implementation of MRI-Linac system in image-guided radiotherapy where highly accurate geometry and anatomy of the target tumour is indispensable.To correct the geometric distortions in MR images, in particular, for the 1 Tesla (T) MRI-Linac system, a deep fully-connected neural network was proposed to automatically learn the intricate relationship between the undistorted (theoretical) and distorted (real) space. A data set, consisting of spatial samples acquired by phantom measurement that covers both inside and outside the working diameter of spherical volume (DSV), was utilised for training the neural network; which offers the ability to describe subtle deviations of the GNL field within the entire region of interest (ROI).The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MR images of a three-dimensional (3D) phantom and the pelvic region of an adult volunteer scanned in the 1T MRI-Linac system. The experimental results showed that the severe geometric distortions within the entire ROI had been successfully corrected with an error less than the pixel size. Also, the presented network is highly efficient, which achieved significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to existing methods.The feasibility of the presented deep neural network for characterising the GNL field deviations in the 1T MRI-Linac system was demonstrated in this study, which shows promise in facilitating the MRI-Linac system to be routinely implemented in real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy",'Wiley',Fast geometric distortion correction using a deep neural network: implementation for the 1 Tesla MRI-Linac system,10.1002/mp.14382,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose is to support decision-making related to the model and simultaneously, serve multiple purposes such as cataloging, protection, restoration, conservation, maintenance or dissemination, among others. The research carried out for the realization of the survey of the City Council and Lonja of Alcañiz (Teruel), has the aim of expanding the historical knowledge of the buildings and delimiting its possible constructive phases, in order to obtain the geometric reality of the buildings. In this way, provide greater instruments to carry out the drafting work of the set restoration project. Quintilla Castán, M.; Agustín Hernández, L.

516350676,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceCollaborative robots are currently deployed in professional environments, in collaboration with professional human operators, helping to strike the right balance between mechanization and manual intervention in manufacturing processes required by Industry 4.0. In this paper, the contribution of gesture recognition and pose estimation to the smooth introduction of cobots into an industrial assembly line is described, with a view to performing actions in parallel with the human operators and enabling interaction between them. The proposed active vision system uses two RGB-D cameras that record different points of view of gestures and poses of the operator, to build an external perception layer for the robot that facilitates spatiotemporal adaptation, in accordance with the human's behavior. The use-case of this work is concerned with LCD TV assembly of an appliance manufacturer, comprising of two parts. The first part of the above-mentioned operation is assigned to a robot, strengthening the assembly line. The second part is assigned to a human operator. Gesture recognition, pose estimation, physical interaction, and sonic notification, create a multimodal human-robot interaction system. Five experiments are performed, to test if gesture recognition and pose estimation can reduce the cycle time and range of motion of the operator, respectively. Physical interaction is achieved using the force sensor of the cobot. Pose estimation through a skeleton-tracking algorithm provides the cobot with human pose information and makes it spatially adjustable. Sonic notification is added for the case of unexpected incidents. A real-time gesture recognition module is implemented through a Deep Learning architecture consisting of Convolutional layers, trained in an egocentric view and reducing the cycle time of the routine by almost 20%. This constitutes an added value in this work, as it affords the potential of recognizing gestures independently of the anthropometric characteristics and the background. Common metrics derived from the literature are used for the evaluation of the proposed system. The percentage of spatial adaptation of the cobot is proposed as a new KPI for a collaborative system and the opinion of the human operator is measured through a questionnaire that concerns the various affective states of the operator during the collaboration",'Frontiers Media SA',Egocentric Gesture Recognition Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for the Spatiotemporal Adaptation of Collaborative Robots,10.3389/fnbot.2021.703545,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles is based on the knowledge-oriented representation of the stages of image processing of objects on digital aerial photographs on board the UAV. This allows to provide intelligent real-time data processing, changing UAV flight routes depending on the objects detected to improve the effectiveness of the search tasks. Further development of this information technology lies in the development of automated methods of planning UAV routes, automatic change of route parameters in flight processes (performance of a flight task), based on knowledge-oriented technologies.

479365133,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The ability to estimate radio coverage accurately is fundamental for planning and optimizing any wireless network, notably when a new generation, as the 5th Generation (5G), is in an early deployment phase. The knowledge acquired from radio planning of previous generations must be revisited, particularly the used path loss and antennas models, as the 5G propagation is intrinsically distinct. This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements. After calibration, the MAE for LoS and NLoS decreased to 5.45 dB and 7.51 dB, respectively. Moreover, the non-calibrated 3GPP path loss model led to overestimations of the 5G coverage and user throughput up to 25&#x0025; and 163&#x0025;, respectively, when compared to the calibrated model predictions. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms resulted in path loss MAEs within the range of 4.58 dB to 5.38 dB, for LoS, and within the range of 3.70 dB to 5.96 dB, for NLoS, with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm attaining the lowest error",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Analysis and Optimization of 5G Coverage Predictions Using a Beamforming Antenna Model and Real Drive Test Measurements,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097633,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
326520478,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The “time-varying loudness (TVL)” model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) calculates “instantaneous loudness” every 1 ms, and this is used to generate predictions of short-term loudness, the loudness of a short segment of sound, such as a word in a sentence, and of long-term loudness, the loudness of a longer segment of sound, such as a whole sentence. The calculation of instantaneous loudness is computationally intensive and real-time implementation of the TVL model is difficult. To speed up the computation, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict instantaneous loudness using a large database of speech sounds and artificial sounds (tones alone and tones in white or pink noise), with the predictions of the TVL model as a reference (providing the ""correct"" answer, specifically the loudness level in phons). A multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers was found to be sufficient, with more complex DNN architecture not yielding higher accuracy. After training, the deviations between the predictions of the TVL model and the predictions of the DNN were typically less than 0.5 phons, even for types of sounds that were not used for training (music, rain, animal sounds, washing machine). The DNN calculates instantaneous loudness over 100 times more quickly than the TVL model. Possible applications of the DNN are discussed.EPSR",Trends in hearing,Development of a Deep Neural Network for Speeding Up a Model of Loudness for Time-Varying Sounds.,10.17863/CAM.54634,https://core.ac.uk/download/326520478.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Learning is here used to improve both the IoT network capability to support a larger number of objects as well as the autonomy of IoT devices. We first illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in a proof-of-concept based on USRP software radio platforms operating on real radio signals. It shows how collisions with other RF signals present in the ISM band are diminished for a given IoT device. Then we describe the first implementation of learning algorithms on LoRa devices operating in a real LoRaWAN network, that we named IoTligent. The proposed solution adds neither processing overhead so that it can be ran in the IoT devices, nor network overhead so that no change is required to LoRaWAN. Real life experiments have been done in a realistic LoRa network and they show that IoTligent device battery life can be extended by a factor 2 in the scenarios we faced during our experiment.L'article décrit les principes et les résultats de la mise en œuvre d'algorithmes d'apprentissage par renforcement sur des appareils de l'Internet des Objets pour l'atténuation des collisions radio dans les bandes non licenciées ISM.

395142086,2019-01-29T00:00:00,"[EN] Classification or typology systems used to categorize different human body parts have
existed for many years. Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features.
Ergonomics, forensic anthropology, crime prevention or new human-machine interaction

digital interlocutors that optimize the interactions between human and machines. However,
classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported
low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. This
work presents a computer-based procedure to automatically classify facial features based
on their global appearance. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgements from human observers, and facilitates the development of
taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained through this procedure are presented

328720905,2020-08-28T14:06:08,"The “time-varying loudness” (TVL) model of Glasberg and Moore calculates “instantaneous loudness” every 1 ms, and this is used to generate predictions of short-term loudness, the loudness of a short segment of sound, such as a word in a sentence, and of long-term loudness, the loudness of a longer segment of sound, such as a whole sentence. The calculation of instantaneous loudness is computationally intensive and real-time implementation of the TVL model is difficult. To speed up the computation, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict instantaneous loudness using a large database of speech sounds and artificial sounds (tones alone and tones in white or pink noise), with the predictions of the TVL model as a reference (providing the “correct” answer, specifically the loudness level in phons). A multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers was found to be sufficient, with more complex DNN architecture not yielding higher accuracy. After training, the deviations between the predictions of the TVL model and the predictions of the DNN were typically less than 0.5 phons, even for types of sounds that were not used for training (music, rain, animal sounds, and washing machine). The DNN calculates instantaneous loudness over 100 times more quickly than the TVL model. Possible applications of the DNN are discussed",Trends in Hearing,Development of a Deep Neural Network for Speeding Up a Model of Loudness for Time-Varying Sounds,10.17863/CAM.56818,https://core.ac.uk/download/328720905.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
441438944,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"A lack of sensory feedback often hinders minimally invasive operations. Although endoscopy has addressed this limitation to an extent, endovascular procedures such as angioplasty or stenting still face significant challenges. Sensors that rely on a clear line of sight cannot be used because it is unable to gather feedback in blood environments. During the stent deployment procedure, feedback on the deployed stent's state is critical because a partially open stent can affect the blood flow. Despite this, no robust and noninvasive clinical solutions that allow real‐time monitoring of the stent deployment exists. In recent years, radio frequency (RF)‐based sensors can detect the shape and material of an object that is hidden from the direct line of sight. Herein, the use of a 3D RF‐based imaging sensor and a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called StentNet is proposed for detecting the stent's state without a need for a clear line of sight. The StentNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90% in detecting the state of an occluded stent in the test dataset. Compared with an existing CNN model, the StentNet significantly outperforms the 3D LeNet in the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‐score",'Wiley',Stent Deployment Detection Using Radio Frequency‐Based Sensor and Convolutional Neural Networks,10.1002/aisy.202000092,,"[{'title': 'Advanced Intelligent Systems', 'identifiers': ['2640-4567', 'issn:2640-4567']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To this aim we performed a study in which we investigated the dimensions that are used to evaluate serious games integrated with those that are typical of the interaction with a social robot. To endow the robot with the capability to play as a game opponent in a real-world context, we implemented an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network so that the robot could detect and classify the waste material as a child would do, by seeing it. After a preliminary evaluation of the approach, we started a formal experiment in which we measured the effectiveness of game design, the robot evaluation and the evaluation of cognitive and affective elements that can form the pro-environmental attitude and then the tendency to recycling. A primary school classroom was involved in the study and, results obtained so far, are encouraging and drew promising possibilities for robotics education in changing recycling attitude for children since Pepper is positively evaluated as trustful and believable and this allowed to be concentrated on the ‘memorization’ task during the game",IEEE Computer Society,Investigating the Social Robots’ Role in Improving Children Attitudes toward Recycling.

390009408,2020-02-20T00:00:00,"Methods of machine intelligence with training contribute their specifics to the creation and commissioning of a gaming system.One of the main problems is the need to anticipate the entire set of input situations and possible answers at the time of design and the impossibility of expanding their list withoutretraining. This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.Методы машинного интеллекта с обучением вносят свою специфику к созданию и наладке игровой системы.Одна из главных проблем — это необходимость предвидения всего набора входных ситуаций и возможных ответов на моменте проектирования и невозможность расширения их списка без переобучения. Это приводит к сужению возможности их использования в реальных игровых системах.Объектом исследования являются процессы создания и обучения игровых агентов на основе эволюционных подходов искусственного интеллекта. Цель работы - разработка и обоснование формальной модели игрового агента, основанного на методах машинного обучения, программная реализация игрового процесса сприменением нейронных сетей и эволюционных методов оптимизации при множественных поколениях популяций игровых агентов.Для осуществления поставленной цели исследована теоретическая база, существующие исследования и разработки в отрасли; спроектирован игровой сценарий, определены основные агенты, их основные возможности и ожидаемое поведение;реализовано обучение игровых агентов различными типами нейронных сетей; выполнено тестирование разработок, оценка качества поведения и принятия решений искусственныминтеллектом с использованием нейронных сетей; проведен сравнительный анализ различных типов нейронных сетей, предлагаемых рекомендаций по их использованию для заданныхусловий. Для отображения искусственной нейронной сети использованы шаблонные компоненты слоя, нейрона и моста.Созданный программный модуль позволит игровым агентам, построенным с использованием различных нейронных сетей, соперничать друг с другом (а не с человеком,как в обычном режиме игры), позволит выявить более подготовленного из них. Научная новизна исследования заключается в том, что формализована модель игрового агента, в основе которой методы машинного обучения. Полученные в работе результаты могут быть использованы при разработке видеоигр, построенных на базе искусственного интеллекта игровых агентов, в основекоторых методы машинного обучения, а также в рамках других научных исследований.Методи машинного інтелекту з навчанням привносять свою специфіку до створення і налагодження ігрової системи.  Одна з головних проблем - це необхідність передбачення усього набору вхідних ситуацій і можливих відповідей на моменті проектування і неможливість розширення їх списку без перенавчання.

387876374,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Volume and ejection fraction (EF) measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in 2-D echocardiography are associated with a high uncertainty not only due to interobserver variability of the manual measurement, but also due to ultrasound acquisition errors such as apical foreshortening. In this work, a real-time and fully automated EF measurement and foreshortening detection method is proposed. The method uses several deep learning components, such as view classification, cardiac cycle timing, segmentation and landmark extraction, to measure the amount of foreshortening, LV volume, and EF. A data set of 500 patients from an outpatient clinic was used to train the deep neural networks, while a separate data set of 100 patients from another clinic was used for evaluation, where LV volume and EF were measured by an expert using clinical protocols and software. A quantitative analysis using 3-D ultrasound showed that EF is considerably affected by apical foreshortening, and that the proposed method can detect and quantify the amount of apical foreshortening. The bias and standard deviation of the automatic EF measurements were -3.6 ± 8.1%, while the mean absolute difference was measured at 7.2% which are all within the interobserver variability and comparable with related studies. The proposed real-time pipeline allows for a continuous acquisition and measurement workflow without user interaction, and has the potential to significantly reduce the time spent on the analysis and measurement error due to foreshortening, while providing quantitative volume measurements in the everyday echo lab",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Real-Time Automatic Ejection Fraction and Foreshortening Detection Using Deep Learning,10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2981037,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
251215068,2019-08-01T00:00:00,"PURPOSE: The use of neural networks to directly predict three-dimensional dose distributions for automatic planning is becoming popular. However, the existing methods use only patient anatomy as input and assume consistent beam configuration for all patients in the training database. The purpose of this work was to develop a more general model that considers variable beam configurations in addition to patient anatomy to achieve more comprehensive automatic planning with a potentially easier clinical implementation, without the need to train specific models for different beam settings. METHODS: The proposed anatomy and beam (AB) model is based on our newly developed deep learning architecture, and hierarchically densely connected U-Net (HD U-Net), which combines U-Net and DenseNet. The AB model contains 10 input channels: one for beam setup and the other 9 for anatomical information (PTV and organs). The beam setup information is represented by a 3D matrix of the non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. We used a set of images from 129 patients with lung cancer treated with IMRT with heterogeneous beam configurations (4-9 beams of various orientations) for training/validation (100 patients) and testing (29 patients). Mean squared error was used as the loss function. We evaluated the model's accuracy by comparing the mean dose, maximum dose, and other relevant dose-volume metrics for the predicted dose distribution against those of the clinically delivered dose distribution. Dice similarity coefficients were computed to address the spatial correspondence of the isodose volumes between the predicted and clinically delivered doses. The model was also compared with our previous work, the anatomy only (AO) model, which does not consider beam setup information and uses only 9 channels for anatomical information. RESULTS: The AB model outperformed the AO model, especially in the low and medium dose regions. In terms of dose-volume metrics, AB outperformed AO by about 1-2%. The largest improvement was found to be about 5% in lung volume receiving a dose of 5Gy or more (V5 ). The improvement for spinal cord maximum dose was also important, that is, 3.6% for cross-validation and 2.6% for testing. The AB model achieved Dice scores for isodose volumes as much as 10% higher than the AO model in low and medium dose regions and about 2-5% higher in high dose regions. CONCLUSIONS: The AO model, which does not use beam configuration as input, can still predict dose distributions with reasonable accuracy in high dose regions but introduces large errors in low and medium dose regions for IMRT cases with variable beam numbers and orientations. The proposed AB model outperforms the AO model substantially in low and medium dose regions, and slightly in high dose regions, by considering beam setup information through a cumulative non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. This new model represents a major step forward towards predicting 3D dose distributions in real clinical practices, where beam configuration could vary from patient to patient, from planner to planner, and from institution to institution.status: publishe",'Wiley',Three-dimensional dose prediction for lung IMRT patients with deep neural networks: robust learning from heterogeneous beam configurations,10.1002/mp.13597,,"[{'title': 'Medical Physics', 'identifiers': ['issn:0094-2405', 'issn:2473-4209', '0094-2405', '2473-4209']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This special issue contains four papers dealing with architectures and design methodologies to support embedded intelligence, but also providing best practices and software support.



The paper “A Technologically Agnostic Framework for Cyber-Physical and IoT Processing-in-Memory-based Systems Simulation”, by Santos et al., aims to focus on Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a solution for efficiently processing big data. In particular, this work presents a framework to simulate and automatically generate code for IoT PIM-based systems. Moreover, it proposes an high speed and energy efficient architecture for an IoT PIM system, able to compute a real image recognition application.



The paper “Recommender system implementations for embedded collaborative filtering applications”, by Pajuelo-Holguera et al., aims to propose a complete recommender system implemented on reconfigurable hardware with the purpose of testing on-chip, low-energy embedded collaborative filtering applications. The proposed approach solves any prediction problem based on collaborative filtering by using an off-line, highly-portable light computing environment. Moreover, this work exploits a custom, fine-grained parallel circuit for quick matrix multiplication with floating-point numbers.



The paper “SystemC-based Electronic System-Level Design Space Exploration Environment for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems”, by Pomante et al., faces the problem of the Electronic System-Level (ESL) HW/SW co-design of dedicated electronic digital systems based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures. In particular, the work presents a prototype SystemC -based environment that exploits a Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach able to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the system specification and a mapping onto an automatically defined architecture.



The paper “A Fast and Scalable Architecture to Run Convolutional Neural Networks in Low Density FPGAs”, by Véstias et al., deals with efficient configurable architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) inference targeting any density FPGAs. The architecture exploits fixed-point arithmetic and image batch to reduce computational, memory and memory bandwidth requirements without compromising network accuracy.



In conclusion, this special issue offers some timely contributions to advance the research of intelligent embedded systems by analyzing both architectures and applications. All of four papers are worth reading and will inspire more interesting ideas and research topics.

The goal of the study is to development of the main points for information technology of automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles. The tasks to be solved are: the structural diagram of the preparatory stage of information technology for automated detection and identification of stationary objects is constructed; the structural diagram of the basic, additional and final stages of information technology automated detection and identification of fixed objects is constructed. General scientific and special methods of scientific knowledge are used. One of the most effective approaches to the recognition and identification of objects is an approach based on the use of deep learning methods. A new model of UAV motion is proposed based on image recognition methods. The methods of pattern recognition with application of neural networks are considered in detail in this work too. The following results are obtained. The developed information technology is implemented in four stages: preparatory, basic, additional and final. Each stage consists of separate procedures aimed at collecting, processing, storing and transmitting information during the flight UAV. Conclusions. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles is based on the knowledge-oriented representation of the stages of image processing of objects on digital aerial photographs on board the UAV. This allows to provide intelligent real-time data processing, changing UAV flight routes depending on the objects detected to improve the effectiveness of the search tasks. Further development of this information technology lies in the development of automated methods of planning UAV routes, automatic change of route parameters in flight processes (performance of a flight task), based on knowledge-oriented technologies.

268992296,2019-07-01,"Multimedia sensors enable monitoring applications to obtain more accurate and detailed information. However, the development of efficient and lightweight solutions for managing data traffic over wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) has become vital because of the excessive volume of data produced by multimedia sensors. As part of this motivation, this paper proposes a fusion-based WMSN framework that reduces the amount of data to be transmitted over the network by intra-node processing. This framework explores three main issues: 1) the design of a wireless multimedia sensor (WMS) node to detect objects using machine learning techniques; 2) a method for increasing the accuracy while reducing the amount of information transmitted by the WMS nodes to the base station, and; 3) a new cluster-based routing algorithm for the WMSNs that consumes less power than the currently used algorithms. In this context, a WMS node is designed and implemented using commercially available components. In order to reduce the amount of information to be transmitted to the base station and thereby extend the lifetime of a WMSN, a method for detecting and classifying objects on three different layers has been developed. A new energy-efficient cluster-based routing algorithm is developed to transfer the collected information/data to the sink. The proposed framework and the cluster-based routing algorithm are applied to our WMS nodes and tested experimentally.

429686511,2020-03-25T00:00:00,"We present a deep learning-based multitask framework for joint 3D human pose estimation and action recognition from RGB sensors using simple cameras. The approach proceeds along two stages. In the first, a real-time 2D pose detector is run to determine the precise pixel location of important keypoints of the human body. A two-stream deep neural network is then designed and trained to map detected 2D keypoints into 3D poses. In the second stage, the Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithm is deployed to find an optimal network architecture that is used for modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of the estimated 3D poses via an image-based intermediate representation and performing action recognition. Experiments on Human3.6M, MSR Action3D and SBU Kinect Interaction datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the targeted tasks. Moreover, we show that the method requires a low computational budget for training and inference. In particular, the experimental results show that by using a monocular RGB sensor, we can develop a 3D pose estimation and human action recognition approach that reaches the performance of RGB-depth sensors. This opens up many opportunities for leveraging RGB cameras (which are much cheaper than depth cameras and extensively deployed in private and public places) to build intelligent recognition systems.Sergio A.

287167378,2020-01-22T00:00:00,"In this article, I review the concept of algorithmic generative and interactive music and discuss the advantages and challenges of its implementation in videogames. Excessive repetition caused by low interactivity in music sequences through gameplay has been tackled primarily by using random or sequential containers, coupled with overlapping rules and adaptive mix parameters, as demonstrated in the Dynamic Music Units in Audiokinetic’s Wwise middleware. This approach provides a higher variety through re-combinatorial properties of music tracks and also a responsive and interactive music stream. However, it mainly uses prerecorded music sequences that reappear and are easy to recognize throughout gameplay. Generative principles such as single-seed design have been occasionally applied in game music scoring to generate material. Some of them are complemented with rules and are assigned to sections with low emotional requirements, but support for real-time interaction in gameplay situations, although desirable, is rarely found.While algorithmic note-by-note generation can offer interactive flexibility and infinite diversity, it poses significant challenges such as achieving human-like performativity and producing a distinctive narrative style through measurable parameters or program arguments. Starting with music generation, I examine conceptual implementations and technical challenges of algorithmic composition studies that use Markov models, a-life/evolutionary music, generative grammars, agents, and artificial neural networks/deep learning. For each model, I evaluate rule-based strategies for interactive music transformation using parameters provided by contextual gameplay situations.

429122002,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Pineapple is an economically important tropical fruit crop, but the lack of adequate planting material limits its productivity.
A range of micropropagation protocols has been developed over the years to address this shortfall. Still, the final stage of
micropropagation, i.e. acclimatisation, remains a challenge as pineapple plantlets grow very slowly. Several studies have been
conducted focusing on this phase and attempting to improve plantlet growth and establishment, which requires tools for the
non-destructive evaluation of growth during acclimatisation. This report describes the use of semi-automated and automated image analysis to quantify canopy growth of pineapple plantlets, during five months of acclimatisation. The canopy area progressively
increased during acclimatisation, particularly after 90 days. Regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between the automated image analysis and morphological indicators of growth. The mathematical relationships between estimations of the canopy area and the fresh and dry weights of intact plantlets, middle-aged leaves (D leaves) and roots showed determination coefficients (R2) between 0.84 and 0.92. We propose an appropriate tool for the simple, objective and non-destructive evaluation of pineapple plantlets growth, which can be generally applied for plant phenotyping, to reduce costs and develop streamlined pipelines for the assessment of plant growthThis research was not covered by any specific grant but supported by internal funds from the Bioplant Centre (Cuba), the Agricultural Research Council-Tropical and Subtropical Crops (South Africa), and the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (Spain).

323366399,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"La colorización es la asignación de posibles colores a los objetos que componen la imagen en escala de grises de forma que correspondan a los reales. La colorización plantea un reto específico en visión computarizada para la reconstrucción de imágenes y video, tales como, la búsqueda de una fiel aproximación, la saturación correcta de colores escogidos y áreas no desfasadas.
La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
Proponemos el diseño e implementación de una herramienta de restauración de imágenes históricas de la ciudad de Barranquilla realizándoles un coloreado por medio de herramientas de computer vision. Cayena, nuestra aplicación web presenta una galería de imágenes de la historia de Barranquilla y de forma interactiva permite realizarles el coloreado. Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
We propose the design and implementation of a image restoration tool for historical images of the city of Barranquilla by applying a colorization using computer vision techniques. Cayena, our web application displays a gallery of historical images of Barranquilla and interactively allows to colorize them. In order to apply the colorization the application makes a request to our API that hosts the service and executes the colorization process; this colorization process consists in the processing of the image so it has the right size and the verification to make sure it is a grayscale image and transform it if it is not, and the subsequent execution of an pre trained CNN model using the Deep Learning framework ‘Caffe’ which predicts the possible real colors of the image","Barranquilla, Universidad del Norte, 2020",Automated colorization using Computer Vision tools for restoring historical images of the city of Barranquilla,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Deep learning models are clear cut techniques for this purpose. This paper’s fundamental purpose is to automatically detect leakage in tanks during production with more reliability than a manual inspection, a common practice in industries. This research proposes an inspection system to predict tank leakage using hydrophone sensor data and deep learning algorithms after production. In this paper, leak detection was investigated using an experimental setup consisting of a plastic tank immersed underwater. Three different techniques for this purpose were implemented and compared with each other, including fast Fourier transform (FFT), wavelet transforms, and time-domain features, all of which are followed with 1D convolution neural network (1D-CNN). Applying FFT and converting the signal to a 1D image followed by 1D-CNN showed better results than other methods.

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells. Hence, the IncuCyte system and its NeuroTrack module provide an appealing platform for efficient in vitro studies of antifungal compounds and immunotherapeu-tic strategies in medical mycology.openWurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P.Wurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P",'American Society for Microbiology',"Live monitoring and analysis of fungal growth, viability, and mycelial morphology using the incucyte neurotrack processing module",10.1128/mBio.00673-19,https://core.ac.uk/download/233571269.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We propose an algorithm to obtain a P system that is equivalent to any decision tree taken as input. In our case, and unlike previous proposals, we formulate the concepts of decision trees endogenously, since there is no external agent involved in the modeling. The tree structure can be defined naturally by the topology of the regions in the P system and the decision rules are defined by communication rules of the P system.Sempere Luna, JM. (2019).

In addition, social robots have been used effectively in educational settings to engage children in the learning process. Following this trend, we designed a serious game in which the social robot Pepper plays with a child to teach him to correctly recycle the materials. To endow the robot with the capability of detecting and classifying the waste material we developed an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network.

Since they are playing an increasingly important role in fields such as face recognition, augmented reality or autonomous driving, there is the growing need for a fast and efficient system to perform the redundant and heavy computations of CNNs. This trend led researchers towards heterogeneous systems provided with hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The vast majority of CNNs is implemented with floating-point parameters and operations, but from research, it has emerged that high classification accuracy can be obtained also by reducing the floating-point activations and weights to binary values. This context is well suitable for FPGAs, that are known to stand out in terms of performance when dealing with binary operations, as demonstrated in FINN, the state-of-the-art framework for building Binarized Neural Network (BNN) accelerators on FPGAs.

However, the technique has been hampered by technical limitations due to massive data throughput requirements and nonlinear inverse search algorithms, limiting it to an offline technique where data must be postprocessed. Aim: To present an MELSCI system capable of continuous acquisition and processing of MELSCI data, enabling real-time video-rate perfusion imaging with high accuracy. Approach: The MELSCI algorithm was implemented in programmable hardware (field programmable gate array) closely interfaced to a high-speed CMOS sensor for real-time calculation. Perfusion images were estimated in real-time from the MELSCI data using an artificial neural network trained on simulated data. The MELSCI perfusion was compared to two existing single-exposure metrics both quantitatively in a controlled phantom experiment and qualitatively in vivo. Results: The MELSCI perfusion shows higher signal dynamics compared to both single-exposure metrics, both spatially and temporally where heartbeat-related variations are resolved in much greater detail. The MELSCI perfusion is less susceptible to measurement noise and is more linear with respect to laser Doppler perfusion in the phantom experiment (R-2 = 0.992). Conclusions: The presented MELSCI system allows for real-time acquisition and calculation of high-quality perfusion at 15.6 frames per second. (C) The Authors.

Due to the lack of an adequate control mechanism in the United Nations system, which would enable the individuals affected by sanctions at least a quasi-judicial review of the decisions adopted by the Sanctions Committee regarding their names being listed on the so called sanctions list, in reality those individuals are faced with violations of their fundamental human rights (e.g. the right to access to court, the right to a fair trial, the right to an effective remedy). The subject of this paper is the analysis of the Security Council’s sanction regime in the fight against terrorism which was introduced in resolution 1267 (1999). The author further analyzes international jurisprudence concerned with the mentioned violations of human rights in the implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council. Special
emphasis is placed on the institution of Ombudsperson and its implications on the sanctions regime. The author concludes with the assessment of the efficacy of the reforms introduced in the sanctions regime as a step forward to the more transparent and effective fight against terrorism.Der Wendepunkt bei der Anwendung von Sanktionen des UN-Sicherheitsrates von an den Staat gerichteten allgemeinen Sanktionen zu den gezielten (klugen) Sanktionen, die direkt und ausschließlich an einzelne mit Terrorismus verbundenen Personen gerichtet sind, hat außer positiven auch negative Auswirkungen verursacht, welche die Gesetzmäßigkeit und Gerechtigkeit von gezielten Sanktionen in Frage

A causa dell’assenza di meccanismi di controllo nel sistema delle Nazioni Unite, il quale permetterebbe ai singoli sanzionati perlomeno un controllo quasi-giudiziale delle decisioni del Comitato per le sanzioni circa l’inserimento dei loro nomi nel c.d. elenco delle sanzioni, nella prassi s’è giunti alla violazione dei loro diritti umani quali il diritto all’accesso alla giustizia, il diritto ad un giusto processo ed il diritto all’appello. Nel lavoro l’autrice

346367817,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, mm-Pose, a novel approach to detect and track human skeletons in real-time using an mmWave radar, is proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation. The proposed method was tested for a single human scenario for four primary motions, (i) Walking, (ii) Swinging left arm, (iii) Swinging right arm, and (iv) Swinging both arms to validate accurate predictions for motion in range, azimuth and elevation. The detailed methodology, implementation, challenges, and validation results are presented.University of ArizonaThis item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

İnsanlar arasında cep telefonu kullanımı çok yaygın hale geldiğinden, en uygun çözümlerden biri cep telefonlarını bu işlem için kullanmak olabilir. Bununla birlikte, bu tür bir çözümün bazı dezavantajları vardır, çünkü belirtilerin değerlendirilmesi hastalığı tespit etmek için yeterli değildir. Bu tarz teknik çözümler bir hastanın COVID-19'a sahip olduğu konusunda kesin çözüm üretmeyecektir, ancak sistemi daha ayrıntılı verilerle besleyerek doğruluğunu arttırmak mümkün olabilmektedir.

Since the use of mobile phones has become very common among people, one of the most convenient solutions may be to use mobile phones for this process. However, such a solution has some disadvantages, because the evaluation of the symptoms is not enough to detect the disease. Such technical solutions will not produce an exact solution that a patient has COVID-19, but it may be possible to increase its accuracy by feeding the system with more detailed data. In this study, we propose a digital twin-based system in which a digital copy of each individual is created. This copy will be in the cloud and will have the entire medical history of the individual. It will also be fed continuously with real-time measurements. This data can be obtained from mobile devices, the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) or any measurement made from doctor reports. The system will be able to process data from sensors that can sample body temperature, blood, or saliva. Data such as cough, respiratory routines, skin color and temperature will be processed and analyzed through decision making processes. Decision making processes will be implemented in the cloud with machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence methods. The individual will be able to see his/her health status on his/her mobile device with the analysis of his/her digital twin. When medical data are anonymized, they can be shared for research purposes. In addition, this data can be kept confidential on the mobile device or encrypted in the cloud. The confidentiality of the data will be ensured using blockchain technology. This decentralized solution has been used to create a system that allows people to have control over their data. The consent of individuals will be asked about when to use their data. Patients and people at risk will be followed up with a protocol established by health officials. The protocol will be defined by smart contracts working on blockchain. With this proposed health information system, it is aimed to provide early diagnosis and prevent the spread of the disease.

Most of the recent deep learning solutions for facial expression recognition under-perform when deployed in Human-Robot-Interaction scenarios, although they are capable of breaking records on the most varied benchmarks on facial expression recognition. The main reason for that we believe is that they are using techniques that are developed for recognition of static pictures, while in real-life scenarios, we infer emotions from intervals of expression.

While public sector traditionally lacks behind business in innovation, significant changes are anticipated with the use of disruptive technologies. The implementation of the new technologies for the government service provision, along with possible benefits, need to be well thought through and challenges need to be carefully discussed, analysed and evaluated. This paper uses scenario-technique to identify research and training needs for the implementation of disruptive technologies in government services. Using the input of 58 experts from three workshops, research and training needs for the internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, as well as big data technologies have been identified.

First, we describe the hardware and software solution employed to build the system. Second, we detail the machine learning methods used for the automatic recognition of the users' mental workload, which are based on the well-known Random Forest algorithm. In order to gather data to train the system, we conducted an extensive user study with 75 participants using a VR flight simulator to induce different levels of mental workload. In contrast to previous works which label the data based on a standardized task (e.g. n-back task) or on a pre-defined task-difficulty, participants were asked about their perceived mental workload level along the experiment. With the data collected, we were able to train the system in order to classify four different levels of mental workload with an accuracy up to 65%. In addition, we discuss the role of the signal normalization procedures, the contribution of the different physiological signals on the recognition accuracy and compare the results obtained with the sensors embedded in the HMD with commercial grade systems. Preliminary results show our pipeline is able to recognize mental workload in real-time. Taken together, our results suggest that such all-in-one approach, with physiological sensors directly embedded in the HMD, is a promising path for VR applications in which the real-time or off-line estimation of Mental Workload assessment is beneficial",HAL CCSD,Towards Real-Time Recognition of Users' Mental Workload Using Integrated Physiological Sensors Into a VR HMD,,https://core.ac.uk/download/362229766.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Our model has as a starting point the representation ofEas the convolution ofIandP. It allows introducing information about latent patients-patients who have already been cured but are still potentially infectious, and re-infected individuals. We also provide three methods for the estimation ofPusing real data, all of them based on the minimization of the quadratic error: the exact solution using the associated Lagrangian function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, a Monte Carlo computational scheme acting on the total set of local minima, and a genetic algorithm for the approximation of the global minima. Although the calculation of the exact solutions of all the linear systems provided by the use of the Lagrangian naturally gives the best optimization result, the huge number of such systems that appear when the time variable increases makes it necessary to use numerical methods. We have chosen the genetic algorithms. Indeed, we show that the results obtained in this way provide good solutions for the model.This research was funded by Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades: MTM2016-77054-C2-1-P and Generalitat Valenciana: Catedra de Transparencia y Gestion de Datos (U.P.V.).

275586244,2019-06-01T00:00:00,"In this work, we present a semantic situation awareness system for multirotor aerial robots, based on 2D LIDAR measurements, targeting the understanding of the environment and assuming to have a precise robot localization as an input of our algorithm. Our proposed situation awareness system calculates a semantic map of the objects of the environment as a list of circles represented by their radius, and the position and the velocity of their center in world coordinates. Our proposed algorithm includes three main parts. First, the LIDAR measurements are preprocessed and an object segmentation clusters the candidate objects present in the environment. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been designed and trained using an artificially generated dataset, computes the radius and the position of the center of individual circles in sensor coordinates. Finally, an indirect-EKF provides the estimate of the semantic map in world coordinates, including the velocity of the center of the circles in world coordinates.We have quantitative and qualitative evaluated the performance of our proposed situation awareness system by means of Software-In-The-Loop simulations using VRep with one and multiple static and moving cylindrical objects in the scene, obtaining results that support our proposed algorithm. In addition, we have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm is capable of handling real environments thanks to real laboratory experiments with non-cylindrical static (i.e. a barrel) and moving (i.e. a person) objects",,Deep learning based semantic situation awareness system for multirotor aerial robots using LIDAR,,https://core.ac.uk/download/275586244.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322372256,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.Scopu",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier,10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Yet, in language and literacy teaching, little is known about using AR to enhance inquiry learning, and to encourage students to experiment with affordances of new media to develop critical and creative knowledge. Although teachers are expected to support students in learning, both with and through new digital forms, there is a slow uptake of new media, such as AR, in Australian contexts. This is possibly due to a lack of mainstream understanding about what AR is and what educational affordances it offers.

322656801,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In any water utility, a reliable assessment of the service life of the network pipes is a key piece within the big puzzle of assets management. This paper presents a new statistical model (basic pipes life assessment, BPLA) to assess the service life of pipes, to locate the pipes on the failures bath curve and to forecast the expected failures in future years. Its main novelties are the processing of pipe information (is that information what is adapted to the classical maintenance engineering and not the other way back) and the definition of two different time variables that can be analyzed in parallel. The first novelty makes the model less demanding in terms of data and software tools than others currently available, and the second one allows to get all the results after one single stage of calculation. To show its usability, the BPLA has been applied to a pipe network that supplies water to 500,000 citizens for which two years of failure records are available. Procedures and results have been compared to the well-known Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM), with final relative errors lower than 10% and 15% on each particular result.The authors would like to thank Global Omnium for the support provided, both directly and through the Catedra Aguas de Valencia of the UPV, for the development of the works presented in this paper.Ramírez-Aguilar, RX.; López Jiménez, PA.; Torres Toro, D.; Cobacho Jordán, R.

322656794,2019-10-20T00:00:00,"[EN] Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain.

Our proposed situation awareness system calculates a semantic map of the objects of the environment as a list of circles represented by their radius, and the position and the velocity of their center in world coordinates. Our proposed algorithm includes three main parts. First, the LIDAR measurements are preprocessed and an object segmentation clusters the candidate objects present in the environment. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been designed and trained using an artificially generated dataset, computes the radius and the position of the center of individual circles in sensor coordinates. Finally, an indirect-EKF provides the estimate of the semantic map in world coordinates, including the velocity of the center of the circles in world coordinates.We have quantitative and qualitative evaluated the performance of our proposed situation awareness system by means of Software-In-The-Loop simulations using VRep with one and multiple static and moving cylindrical objects in the scene, obtaining results that support our proposed algorithm.

355099865,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Abstract: Poor management practices of road transport assets posed a challenge to the sustainable development of the transport system in developing countries like Nigeria. Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria. The study identified 4.0IR drivers to include; robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 3D printing drones that are built with an attached 3D printer, (the drone hangs a 3D printing nozzle that's fed plastic, concrete mix or other material from a tube connected to the top of the drone's printing path that precisely plotted by software, for a promised printing accuracy of 0.1mm),and digital engineering.

In addition, sorghum cultivation is economically profitable and it does not contain the proteins that affect celiac patients. In the last years, a variety of ""free gluten"" food products were developed for improving the celiac diet, as well as sorghum beers, which are frequently produced in a home-made manner on a very small scale by individual brewers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a non-alcoholic beverage from sorghum. In this work, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a batch plant for producing malt drink from sorghum at industrial level is proposed. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, which is implemented and solved in GAMS using the CPLEX solver. Through experimental results, design and operation model parameters are obtained in order to develop real-fit formulation. The investment cost is minimized, and a technical-social-economical analysis is presented in order to evaluate the more profitable and sustainable option to produce malt drink from sorghum.

First, we describe the hardware and software solution employed to build the system. Second, we detail the machine learning methods used for the automatic recognition of the users' mental workload, which are based on the well-known Random Forest algorithm. In order to gather data to train the system, we conducted an extensive user study with 75 participants using a VR flight simulator to induce different levels of mental workload. In contrast to previous works which label the data based on a standardized task (e.g. n-back task) or on a pre-defined task-difficulty, participants were asked about their perceived mental workload level along the experiment. With the data collected, we were able to train the system in order to classify four different levels of mental workload with an accuracy up to 65%. In addition, we discuss the role of the signal normalization procedures, the contribution of the different physiological signals on the recognition accuracy and compare the results obtained with the sensors embedded in the HMD with commercial grade systems. Preliminary results show our pipeline is able to recognize mental workload in real-time. Taken together, our results suggest that such all-in-one approach, with physiological sensors directly embedded in the HMD, is a promising path for VR applications in which the real-time or off-line estimation of Mental Workload assessment is beneficial",HAL CCSD,Towards Real-Time Recognition of Users' Mental Workload Using Integrated Physiological Sensors Into a VR HMD,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, annotation is mostly performed by observers with medical background and is incredibly costly and time-consuming, creating a major bottleneck for the above-mentioned technologies. In this paper, we propose a way to eliminate, or at least limit, the human intervention in the annotation process.  Methods - Meaningful information about interaction between objects is inherently available in virtual reality environments. We propose a strategy to convert automatically this information into annotations in order to provide as output individual surgical process models.  Validation - We implemented our approach through a peg-transfer task simulator and compared it to manual annotations. To assess the impact of our contribution, we studied both intra- and inter-observer variability.  Results and conclusion - In average, manual annotations took more than 12 min for 1 min of video to achieve low-level physical activity annotation, whereas automatic annotation is achieved in less than a second for the same video period.

We used the RTPVR method to measure ventricular geometry, ES pressure area relationship (ESPAR) and ESPVR during vena cava occlusion (VCO) in normal sheep. 14 adult sheep were anesthetized and underwent measurement of LV systolic function. Ten of the 14 sheep underwent RTMRI and eight of the 14 underwent measurement with conductance catheter; 4 had both RTMRI and conductance measurements. 2D cross sectional RTMRI were performed at apex, mid-ventricle and base levels during separate VCOs. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to compare LSSPM and manual image segmentation and thus determine LSSPM accuracy. LV cross-sectional area, major and minor axis length, axis ratio, major axis orientation angle and ESPAR were measured at each LV level. ESPVR was calculated with a trapezoidal rule. The Dice similarity coefficient between LSSPM and manual segmentation by two readers was 87.31±2.51% and 88.13±3.43%. All cross sections became more elliptical during VCO. The major axis orientation shifted during VCO but remained in the septo-lateral direction. LV chamber obliteration at the apical level occurred during VCO in 7 of 10 sheep that underwent RTMRI. ESPAR was non-linear at all levels. Finally, ESPVR was non-linear because of apical collapse. ESPVR measured by conductance catheter (EES,Index = 2.23±0.66 mmHg/ml/m2) and RT (EES,Index = 2.31±0.31 mmHg/ml/m2) was not significantly different.

A new model of UAV motion is proposed based on image recognition methods. The methods of pattern recognition with application of neural networks are considered in detail in this work too. The following results are obtained. The developed information technology is implemented in four stages: preparatory, basic, additional and final. Each stage consists of separate procedures aimed at collecting, processing, storing and transmitting information during the flight UAV. Conclusions. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles is based on the knowledge-oriented representation of the stages of image processing of objects on digital aerial photographs on board the UAV. This allows to provide intelligent real-time data processing, changing UAV flight routes depending on the objects detected to improve the effectiveness of the search tasks. Further development of this information technology lies in the development of automated methods of planning UAV routes, automatic change of route parameters in flight processes (performance of a flight task), based on knowledge-oriented technologies. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles can become an element of intelligent decision support systems for the use of UAVs (teams of UAVs) to search for both stationary and dynamic objects.Предметом вивчення в статті є процес розробки інформаційної технології автоматизованого виявлення та ідентифікації стаціонарних об'єктів безпілотними літальними апаратами.

287207358,2020,"This work proposes an innovative method for evaluating users’ engagement, combining the

User Engagement Scale (UES) questionnaire and a facial expression recognition (FER) system, active

research topics of increasing interest in the human–computer interaction domain (HCI). The subject

of the study is a 3D simulator that reproduces a virtual FabLab in which users can approach and

learn 3D modeling software and 3D printing. During the interaction with the virtual environment,

a structured-light camera acquires the face of the participant in real-time, to catch its spontaneous

reactions and compare them with the answers to the UES closed-ended questions. FER methods allow

overcoming some intrinsic limits in the adoption of questioning methods, such as the non-sincerity

of the interviewees and the lack of correspondence with facial expressions and body language.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been trained on the Bosphorus database (DB) to perform

expression recognition and the classification of the video frames in three classes of engagement

(deactivation, average activation, and activation) according to the model of emotion developed by

Russell. The results show that the two methodologies can be integrated to evaluate user engagement,

233572457,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"In this article, we propose an augmented reality semiautomatic labeling (ARS), a semiautomatic method which leverages on moving a 2-D camera by means of a robot, proving precise camera tracking, and an augmented reality pen (ARP) to define initial object bounding box, to create large labeled data sets with minimal human intervention. By removing the burden of generating annotated data from humans, we make the deep learning technique applied to computer vision, which typically requires very large data sets, truly automated and reliable. With the ARS pipeline, we created two novel data sets effortlessly, one on electromechanical components (industrial scenario) and other on fruits (daily-living scenario) and trained two state-of-the-art object detectors robustly, based on convolutional neural networks, such as you only look once (YOLO) and single shot detector (SSD). With respect to conventional manual annotation of 1000 frames that takes us slightly more than 10 h, the proposed approach based on ARS allows to annotate 9 sequences of about 35,000 frames in less than 1 h, with a gain factor of about 450.

237398591,2020-05-01T00:00:00,"A Digital Twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources, and to represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, the current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multi-tier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs which is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge was developed, which integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysing, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learnt and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels.Centre for Digital Built Britain (Innovate UK); Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (Innovate UK/EPSRC",Journal of Management in Engineering,Developing a dynamic digital twin at building and city levels: A case study of the West Cambridge campus,10.17863/CAM.45198,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
344885219,2020-03-25T00:00:00,"International audienceWe present a deep learning-based multitask framework for joint 3D human pose estimation and action recognition from RGB sensors using simple cameras. The approach proceeds along two stages. In the first, a real-time 2D pose detector is run to determine the precise pixel location of important keypoints of the human body. A two-stream deep neural network is then designed and trained to map detected 2D keypoints into 3D poses. In the second stage, the Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithm is deployed to find an optimal network architecture that is used for modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of the estimated 3D poses via an image-based intermediate representation and performing action recognition. Experiments on Human3.6M, MSR Action3D and SBU Kinect Interaction datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the targeted tasks. Moreover, we show that the method requires a low computational budget for training and inference. In particular, the experimental results show that by using a monocular RGB sensor, we can develop a 3D pose estimation and human action recognition approach that reaches the performance of RGB-depth sensors. This opens up many opportunities for leveraging RGB cameras (which are much cheaper than depth cameras and extensively deployed in private and public places) to build intelligent recognition systems",'MDPI AG',A Unified Deep Framework for Joint 3D Pose Estimation and Action Recognition from a Single RGB Camera,10.3390/s20071825,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Specifically, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) was applied removing the need for reliance on expert judgement, and analysed interdependencies among water quality parameters and microbiological characteristics of DWDS composed of different pipe materials. In addition, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) ranked the most common bacteria identified during trials in a DWDS according to their relative abundance while managing vagueness affecting the measurements. The novel integrated approach presented and proven here for an initial real world data set provides new insights in the interdependence of environmental conditions and microbial populations. Specifically, the application shows as the bacteria having associated the most significant microbial impact may not be the most abundant. This offers the potential for integrated management strategies to promote favourable microbial conditions to help safeguard drinking water quality.The research reported here was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), EPSRC-LWEC Challenge Fellowship EP/N02950X/1.

429121482,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Background and objective: As Computed Tomography scans are an essential medical test, many techniques have been proposed to reconstruct high-quality images using a smaller amount of radiation. One approach is to employ algebraic factorization methods to reconstruct the images, using fewer views than the traditional analytical methods. However, their main drawback is the high computational cost and hence the time needed to obtain the images, which is critical in the daily clinical practice. For this reason, faster methods for solving this problem are required.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the QR factorization that is very efficient on affordable equipment (standard multicore processors and standard Solid-State Drives) by using Out-Of-Core techniques.

Results: Combining both affordable hardware and the new software proposed in our work, the images can be reconstructed very quickly and with high quality. We analyze the reconstructions using real Computed Tomography images selected from a dataset, comparing the QR method to the LSQR and FBP. We measure the quality of the images using the metrics Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, obtaining very high values. We also compare the efficiency of using spinning disks versus Solid-State Drives, showing how the latter performs the Input/Output operations in a significantly lower amount of time. Conclusions: The results indicate that our proposed me thod and software are valid to efficiently solve large-scale systems and can be applied to the Computed Tomography reconstruction problem to obtain high-quality images.This research has been supported by ""Universitat Politecnica de Valencia"", ""Generalitat Valenciana"" under PROMETEO/2018/035 and ACIF/2017/075, co-financed by FEDER and FSE funds, and the ""Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities"" under Grant RTI2018-098156-B-C54 co-financed by FEDER funds.Chillarón-Pérez, M.; Quintana Ortí, G.; Vidal-Gimeno, V.; Verdú Martín, GJ.

477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R). The work of Patricia Pons is supported by a national grant from the Spanish MECD (FPU13/03831).

426867658,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments",'MDPI AG',BCNDataset: Description and Analysis of an Annotated Night Urban Leisure Sound Dataset,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we present the results of a set of experiments aimed at predicting the players\u2019 emotions during video games sessions using their physiological data. We have created a physiological dataset from the data acquired by 33 participants during video game fruition using a standard monitor and a Virtual Reality headset. The dataset contains information about electrocardiogram, 5 facials electromyographies, electrodermal activity, and respiration. Furthermore, we have asked the players to self-assess their emotional state on the Arousal and Valence space. We have then analyzed the contribution of each physiological signal to the overall definition of the players\u2019 mental state. Finally, we have applied Machine Learning techniques to predict the emotional state of players during game sessions at a precision of one second.

483665146,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An image is worth a thousand words; hence, a face image illustrates extensive details about the speciﬁcation, gender, age, and emotional states of mind. Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human–computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one ﬁnds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The ﬁrst branch explores geo-metric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the ﬁnal classiﬁca-tion score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on ﬁve benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The data-bases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. The proposed method is compared with existing approaches using four evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

However, during a time-out, surgical participants are unable to review the patient's charts due to their aseptic hands. To improve the conditions in surgical time-outs, we introduce a deep learning-based smart speaker to confirm the surgical information prior to cataract surgeries. This pilot study utilized the publicly available audio vocabulary dataset and recorded audio data published by the authors. The audio clips of the target words, such as left, right, cataract, phacoemulsification, and intraocular lens, were selected to determine and confirm surgical information in the time-out speech. A deep convolutional neural network model was trained and implemented in the smart speaker that was developed using a mini development board and commercial speakerphone. To validate our model in the consecutive speeches during time-outs, we generated 200 time-out speeches for cataract surgeries by randomly selecting the surgical statuses of the surgical participants. After the training process, the deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% for the validation dataset of short-word audio clips. Our deep learning-based smart speaker achieved an accuracy of 93.5% for the 200 time-out speeches. The surgical and procedural accuracy was 100%. Additionally, on validating the deep learning model by using web-generated time-out speeches and video clips for general surgery, the model exhibited a robust and good performance. In this pilot study, the proposed deep learning-based smart speaker was able to successfully confirm the surgical information during the time-out speech. Future studies should focus on collecting real-world time-out data and automatically connecting the device to electronic health records.

The obtained algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the (unseen) test sequences. The obtained performances are achieved thanks to a well-chosen model, a proper loss function for orientation increments, and through the identification of key points when training with high-frequency inertial data. Our approach builds upon a neural network based on dilated convolutions, without requiring any recurrent neural network. We demonstrate how efficient our strategy is for 3D attitude estimation on the EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets. Interestingly, we observe our dead reckoning algorithm manages to beat top-ranked visual-inertial odometry systems in terms of attitude estimation although it does not use vision sensors. We believe this paper offers new perspectives for visual-inertial localization and constitutes a step toward more efficient learning methods involving IMUs.

The gradient non-linearity (GNL) induced distortions in MRI; however, hinder the implementation of MRI-Linac system in image-guided radiotherapy where highly accurate geometry and anatomy of the target tumour is indispensable.To correct the geometric distortions in MR images, in particular, for the 1 Tesla (T) MRI-Linac system, a deep fully-connected neural network was proposed to automatically learn the intricate relationship between the undistorted (theoretical) and distorted (real) space. A data set, consisting of spatial samples acquired by phantom measurement that covers both inside and outside the working diameter of spherical volume (DSV), was utilised for training the neural network; which offers the ability to describe subtle deviations of the GNL field within the entire region of interest (ROI).The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MR images of a three-dimensional (3D) phantom and the pelvic region of an adult volunteer scanned in the 1T MRI-Linac system. The experimental results showed that the severe geometric distortions within the entire ROI had been successfully corrected with an error less than the pixel size. Also, the presented network is highly efficient, which achieved significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to existing methods.The feasibility of the presented deep neural network for characterising the GNL field deviations in the 1T MRI-Linac system was demonstrated in this study, which shows promise in facilitating the MRI-Linac system to be routinely implemented in real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy",'Wiley',Fast geometric distortion correction using a deep neural network: implementation for the 1 Tesla MRI-Linac system,10.1002/mp.14382,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The goal of the study is to development of the main points for information technology of automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles. The tasks to be solved are: the structural diagram of the preparatory stage of information technology for automated detection and identification of stationary objects is constructed; the structural diagram of the basic, additional and final stages of information technology automated detection and identification of fixed objects is constructed. General scientific and special methods of scientific knowledge are used. One of the most effective approaches to the recognition and identification of objects is an approach based on the use of deep learning methods. A new model of UAV motion is proposed based on image recognition methods. The methods of pattern recognition with application of neural networks are considered in detail in this work too. The following results are obtained. The developed information technology is implemented in four stages: preparatory, basic, additional and final. Each stage consists of separate procedures aimed at collecting, processing, storing and transmitting information during the flight UAV. Conclusions. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles is based on the knowledge-oriented representation of the stages of image processing of objects on digital aerial photographs on board the UAV. This allows to provide intelligent real-time data processing, changing UAV flight routes depending on the objects detected to improve the effectiveness of the search tasks. Further development of this information technology lies in the development of automated methods of planning UAV routes, automatic change of route parameters in flight processes (performance of a flight task), based on knowledge-oriented technologies.

326520478,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The “time-varying loudness (TVL)” model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) calculates “instantaneous loudness” every 1 ms, and this is used to generate predictions of short-term loudness, the loudness of a short segment of sound, such as a word in a sentence, and of long-term loudness, the loudness of a longer segment of sound, such as a whole sentence. The calculation of instantaneous loudness is computationally intensive and real-time implementation of the TVL model is difficult. To speed up the computation, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict instantaneous loudness using a large database of speech sounds and artificial sounds (tones alone and tones in white or pink noise), with the predictions of the TVL model as a reference (providing the ""correct"" answer, specifically the loudness level in phons). A multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers was found to be sufficient, with more complex DNN architecture not yielding higher accuracy. After training, the deviations between the predictions of the TVL model and the predictions of the DNN were typically less than 0.5 phons, even for types of sounds that were not used for training (music, rain, animal sounds, washing machine). The DNN calculates instantaneous loudness over 100 times more quickly than the TVL model. Possible applications of the DNN are discussed.EPSR",Trends in hearing,Development of a Deep Neural Network for Speeding Up a Model of Loudness for Time-Varying Sounds.,10.17863/CAM.54634,https://core.ac.uk/download/326520478.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
477989381,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls is one of most concerning accidents in aged population due to its high frequency and serious repercussion; thus, quick assistance is critical to avoid serious health consequences. There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement.This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program as part of the ACTIVAGE project under Grant 732679.Sarabia-Jácome, D.; Usach, R.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

The development of modern neural network IT gives rise to a number of urgent tasks at the junction of several scientific disciplines. One of them is to create a hardware platform – a neuroprocessor for energy-efficient operation of neural networks. Recently, the development of nanotechnology of the main units of the neuroprocessor relies on combined memristor super-large logical and storage matrices. The matrix topology is built on the principle of maximum integration of programmable links between nodes. This article describes a method for implementing biomorphic neural functionality based on programmable links of a highly integrated 3D logic matrix. This paper focuses on the problem of achieving energy efficiency of the hardware used to model neural networks. The main part analyzes the known facts of the principles of information transfer and processing in biological systems from the point of view of their implementation in the input unit of the neuroprocessor. The author deals with the scheme of an electronic neuron implemented based on elements of a 3D logical matrix. A pulsed method of encoding input information is presented, which most realistically reflects the principle of operation of a sensory biological neural system. The model of an electronic neuron for selecting ranges of technological parameters in a real 3D logic matrix scheme is analyzed. The implementation of disjunctively normal forms is shown, using the logic function in the input unit of a neuroprocessor as an example. The results of modeling fragments of electric circuits with memristors of a 3D logical matrix in programming mode are presented. The author concludes that biomorphic pulse coding of standard digital signals allows achieving a high degree of energy efficiency of the logic elements of the neuroprocessor by reducing the number of valve operations.

Here we present a robust human following system that has the extendability to commercial service robot platforms having a RGB-D camera. The proposed framework integrates deep learning methods for perception and variational Bayesian techniques for trajectory prediction. Deep learning modules enable robots to accompany a person by detecting the target, learning the target and following while avoiding collision within the dynamic home environment. The variational Bayesian techniques robustly predict the trajectory of the target by empowering the following ability of the robot when target is lost. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the deep Bayesian trajectory prediction method on real-time usage, following abilities, collision avoidance and trajectory prediction of the system.

478629245,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Purpose: This retrospective study analyzes deviations between preoperative planning and postoperative outcome in orthognathic surgery using 2D Onyx Ceph (R) - cephalometric analyzing and planning system. Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients with a mean age 25.1 of years were included in this study. In 33 patients a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and in seven patients a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed. A total of 60 patients were treated by a bimaxillary approach. Onyx Ceph (R) was used as cephalometric planning software (Onyx Ceph (R)), followed by mock operations. Postoperative cephalograms were obtained after 3.3 days and compared to preoperative planning cephalograms for sagittal (SNA, SNB, ANB) and vertical (ArGoMe, ML-NSL, NL-NSL) angle measurements. Real and absolute mean deviation were documented. Results: Absolute mean deviation (degrees) between postoperative and planned jaw movement was lower for the sagittal parameters SNA (0.58), SNB (1.15) and ANB (1.05) compared to the vertical parameters NL-NSL (1.47), ML-NSL (1.96) and ArGoMe (3.20). SNA, SNB and ANB showed constant deviations independent from the extent of jaw movement. With regard to the vertical parameters ML-NSL, ArGoMe and NL-NSL the extent of the postoperative rotational jaw movement was not as much as planned, particularly for vertical shifts of more than 4 degrees. Conclusion: By using the 2D Onyx Ceph (R) cephalometric software for orthognathic surgery, the deviations between planned and actual movements are within an acceptable and predictable range. Planning of extensive vertical alterations may result in greater deviations after surgery. (C) 2018 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

417852328,2017-06-01T00:00:00,"A valid model of the air surveillance system performance is highly valued when making decisions related to the optimal control of the system. We formulate a model for a multi-radar tracker system by combining a radar performance model with a tracker performance model. A tracker as a complex software system is hard to model mathematically and physically. Our novel approach is to utilize machine learning to create a tracker model based on measurement data from which the input and target output for the model are calculated. The measured data comprises the time series of 3D coordinates of cooperative aircraft flights, the corresponding target detection recordings from multiple radars, and the related multi-radar track recordings. The collected data is used to calculate performance measures for the radars and the tracker at specific locations in the air space. We apply genetic programming to learning such rules from radar performance measures that explain tracker performance. The easily interpretable rules are intended to reveal the real behavior of the system providing comprehension for its control and further development. The learned rules allow predicting tracker performance level for the system control in all radar geometries, modes, and conditions at any location. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of our approach to learning a tracker model and compare our rule learner with two tree classifiers, another rule learner, a neural network, and an instance-based classifier using the real air surveillance data.

162472091,2018,"In this paper, a novel sensor platform based on screen printed carbon electrode coated by graphene modified polyacrylamide gel (GR/PAAGC) was developed and implemented for sampling, detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria (coliforms) on food contact surfaces. The optimized formula of polyacrylamide (PAA) and agar-agar increased the adhesive properties of the gel, being crucial for the coliforms recovery, attached to food contact surfaces. The 6-Chloro-3-indoxyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (6-CIGP) was used as a new electrochemical reporter for β-D-galactosidase activity. The released 6,6′-Dichloro-Indigo (6-DI) was directly detected by GR/PAAGC sensor. The presence of Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and n-Octyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (OBDG) in the gel contributed to reduction of the detection time. The addition of graphene enhanced the voltammetric signal and increased the conductivity of PAA gel.

Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument.

217873301,2018-09-01T00:00:00,"International audienceModern surface acquisition devices, such as interferometers and confocal microscopes, make it possible to have accurate three-dimensional (3D) numerical representations of real surfaces. The numerical dental surfaces hold details that are related to the microwear that is caused by food processing. As there are numerous surface parameters that describe surface properties and knowing that a lot more can be built, is it possible to identify the ones that can separate taxa based on their diets? Until now, the candidates were chosen from among those provided by metrology software, which often implements International Organization for Standardization (ISO) parameters. Moreover, the way that a parameter is declared as diet-discriminative differs from one researcher to another. The aim of the present work is to propose a framework to broaden the investigation of relevant parameters and subsequently a procedure that is based on statistical tests to highlight the best of them. Many parameters were tested in a previous study. Here, some were dropped and others added to the classical ones. The resulting set is doubled while considering two derived surfaces: the initial one minus a second order and an eighth order polynomial. The resulting surfaces are then sampled—256 samples per surface—making it possible to build new derived parameters that are based on statistics. The studied dental surfaces belong to seven sets of three or more groups with known differences in diet. In almost all cases, the statistical procedure succeeds in identifying the most relevant parameters to reflect the group differences. Surprisingly, the widely used Area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc) parameter—despite some improvements—cannot differentiate the groups as accurately. The present work can be used as a standalone procedure, but it can also be seen as a first step towards machine learning where a lot of training data is necessary, thus making the human intervention prohibitive",,'MDPI AG',Gathering and Analyzing Surface Parameters for Diet Identification Purposes,https://core.ac.uk/download/217873301.pdf,10.3390/technologies6030075,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
158414686,2018-04-09T17:56:06,"Robots that use learned  perceptual  models in the real world must be able to safely handle cases where they are forced to make decisions in scenarios that are unlike any of their training  examples. However,  state-of-the-art  deep  learning methods are known to produce erratic or unsafe predictions when faced with novel inputs. Furthermore, recent ensemble, bootstrap and dropout methods for quantifying neural network uncertainty may not efficiently provide accurate uncertainty estimates when queried  with  inputs  that  are  very  different  from  their  training data. Rather than unconditionally trusting the predictions of a neural network for unpredictable real-world data, we use an autoencoder  to recognize when a query is novel, and revert to a safe prior behavior. With this capability,  we can deploy an autonomous deep learning system in arbitrary environments, without concern for whether it has received the appropriate training. We demonstrate our method with a vision-guided robot that can leverage its deep neural network to navigate 50% faster than  a  safe  baseline  policy in familiar types of  environments, while  reverting  to  the prior behavior in novel environments so that it can safely collect additional training data and continually improve.

235261716,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",,TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,https://core.ac.uk/download/235261716.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
212391998,2018-06-01T00:00:00,"We present a method to extract a video sequence from a single motion-blurred image. Motion-blurred images are the result of an averaging process, where instant frames are accumulated over time during the exposure of the sensor. Unfortunately, reversing this process is nontrivial. Firstly, averaging destroys the temporal ordering of the frames. Secondly, the recovery of a single frame is a blind deconvolution task, which is highly ill-posed. We present a deep learning scheme that gradually reconstructs a temporal ordering by sequentially extracting pairs of frames. Our main contribution is to introduce loss functions invariant to the temporal order. This lets a neural network choose during training what frame to output among the possible combinations.

395008361,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Human-robot collaboration could be advanced by facilitating the intuitive, gaze-based control of robots, and enabling robots to recognize human actions, infer human intent, and plan actions that support human goals. Traditionally, gaze tracking approaches to action recognition have relied upon computer vision-based analyses of two-dimensional egocentric camera videos. The objective of this study was to identify useful features that can be extracted from three-dimensional (3D) gaze behavior and used as inputs to machine learning algorithms for human action recognition. We investigated human gaze behavior and gaze-object interactions in 3D during the performance of a bimanual, instrumental activity of daily living: the preparation of a powdered drink. A marker-based motion capture system and binocular eye tracker were used to reconstruct 3D gaze vectors and their intersection with 3D point clouds of objects being manipulated. Statistical analyses of gaze fixation duration and saccade size suggested that some actions (pouring and stirring) may require more visual attention than other actions (reach, pick up, set down, and move). 3D gaze saliency maps, generated with high spatial resolution for six subtasks, appeared to encode action-relevant information. The ""gaze object sequence"" was used to capture information about the identity of objects in concert with the temporal sequence in which the objects were visually regarded. Dynamic time warping barycentric averaging was used to create a population-based set of characteristic gaze object sequences that accounted for intra- and inter-subject variability. The gaze object sequence was used to demonstrate the feasibility of a simple action recognition algorithm that utilized a dynamic time warping Euclidean distance metric. Averaged over the six subtasks, the action recognition algorithm yielded an accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 89.5%, and recall of 89.2%. This level of performance suggests that the gaze object sequence is a promising feature for action recognition whose impact could be enhanced through the use of sophisticated machine learning classifiers and algorithmic improvements for real-time implementation. Robots capable of robust, real-time recognition of human actions during manipulation tasks could be used to improve quality of life in the home and quality of work in industrial environments",,"eScholarship, University of California",Exploiting Three-Dimensional Gaze Tracking for Action Recognition During Bimanual Manipulation to Enhance Human-Robot Collaboration.,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is therefore not surprising that sev- eral related techniques and methods have been investi- gated in recent years. However, very few camera-based systems proposed in the literature are both real-time and robust. In this work, we propose a real-time user- calibration-free gaze estimation system that does not need person-dependent calibration, can deal with illumi- nation changes and head pose variations, and can work with a wide range of distances from the camera. Our solution is based on a 3-D appearance-based method that processes the images from a built-in laptop camera. Real-time performance is obtained by combining head pose information with geometrical eye features to train a machine learning algorithm. Our method has been validated on a data set of images of users in a natural environment, showing promising results.

160467102,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Background/Aims: Apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The impact of aTRH and achievement of recommended blood pressure (BP) values on the rate of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss in CKD patients is poorly known. To assess the role of aTRH and time-updated BP control (BPC) on the progression of CKD in patients with T2D and hypertension (HT) in real life clinical practice. Methods: Clinical records from a total of 2,778 diabetic patients with HT and stage 3 CKD (i.e. baseline eGFR values between 30 and 60 ml/min) and regular visits during a four-year follow-up were analyzed. The association between BPC (i.e. 75% of visits with BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) and eGFR loss (i.e. a &gt;30% reduction from baseline) or worsening of albuminuria status over time was assessed. Results: At baseline 33% of patients had aTRH. Over the 4-year follow-up, 20% had a &gt;30% eGFR reduction. Patients with aTRH had an increased risk of eGFR loss &gt;30% (OR 1.31; P&lt;0.007). In patients with aTRH, BPC was associated with a 79% (P=0.029) greater risk of eGFR reduction despite a 58% (P=0.001) lower risk of albuminuria status worsening. In non-aTRH, no association was found between BPC and renal outcome. Conclusion: In patients with stage 3 CKD the presence of aTRH entails a faster loss of eGFR. More effective prevention of aTRH should be implemented as this condition is associated with a burden of risk not modifiable by tight BP reduction",,'S.

288358137,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Two-dimensional (2D) crystals, for which the shape is described by two linear sizes, are common in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Since the crystal size and shape are directly related to the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the simultaneous size and shape distribution control is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical crystallization engineering. To efficiently achieve simultaneous size and shape control often requires model-based control strategies; however, the increased computational cost of the process simulation and the substantial differences between the simulated and measurable quantities make the implementation of model-based control approaches challenging. This paper addresses the important problem of the real-time simulation of the most likely measurable chord length distribution (CLD) and aspect ratio distribution (ARD) as well as the concentration variations during the crystallization of 2D needle-shaped crystals. This enables the application of focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) and particle vision and microscopy (PVM), two routinely applied probes, as quantitative direct feedback control tools. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based FBRM and PVM soft-sensors are developed, which enable the direct and fast transformation of 2D crystal size distribution (CSD) to CLD and ARD on arbitrary 2D grids. The training data for the ANN are generated by a first principle, geometrical model-based simulation of FBRM and PVM for high aspect ratio crystals, although the ANN approach is applicable for any simulated or experimental training data sets. It is also demonstrated that the in situ imaging-based shape measurement underestimates the real aspect ratio (AR) of crystals, for which a simple correction is proposed. From the model-equation solution perspective, the soft-sensors require full population balance solution. The 2D high-resolution finite volume method is applied to simulate the full 2D CSD, which is an accurate, stable, but computationally expensive technique. The real-time applicability is achieved through various implementation improvements including grid optimization and data-type optimized hybrid central processing unit-graphical processing unit calculations",,,Aspect ratio distribution and chord length distribution driven modeling of crystallization of two-dimensional crystals for real-time model-based applications,https://core.ac.uk/download/288358137.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The new implementation, which is coded in C++ and takes advantage of the parallelization functionalities both on CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units), was validated using different benchmark cases and compared, in terms of numerical output and computational efficiency, with other well-known hydraulic software packages. Depending on the complexity of the specific test case, the new parallel implementation can achieve speedups up to two orders of magnitude when compared with the standard version. The speedup is especially remarkable for the GPU parallelization that uses Nvidia CUDA (compute unified device architecture). The efficiency is as good as the one provided by some of the most popular hydraulic models. We also present the application of Iber+ to model an extreme flash flood that took place in the Spanish Pyrenees in October 2012. The new implementation was used to simulate 24 h of real time in roughly eight minutes of computing time, while the standard version needed more than 15 h.

Composing questions in the examination process to measure students’ achievement in the school teaching and learning process can be difficult and time consuming. To solve this problem, this research proposes Automatic Question Generation (AQG) method to generate Open Domain Indonesian Question by using syntactical approach. Open Domain questions are questions covering many domains of knowledge. The challenge of generating the questions is how to identify the types of declarative sentences that are

potential to be transformed into questions and how to develop the method for generating question

automatically. In realizing the method, this research incorporates four stages, namely: the identification of

declarative sentence for 8 coarse-class and 19 fine-class sentences, the classification of features for coarseclass

sentence and the classification rules for fine-class sentence, the identification of question patterns, and the extraction of sentence’s components as well as the rule generation of questions. The coarse-class classification was carried out based on a machine learning with syntactical features of the sentence, namely:

322372256,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations.

System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

302833051,2019-05-08T00:00:00,"Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data","[{'title': 'Nature', 'identifiers': ['issn:0028-0836', '0028-0836']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',All-optical spiking neurosynaptic networks with self-learning capabilities,,10.1038/s41586-019-1157-8,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
345057677,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"In this work, we present a semantic situation awareness system for multirotor aerial robots, based on 2D LIDAR measurements, targeting the understanding of the environment and assuming to have a precise robot localization as an input of our algorithm. Our proposed situation awareness system calculates a semantic map of the objects of the environment as a list of circles represented by their radius, and the position and the velocity of their center in world coordinates. Our proposed algorithm includes three main parts. First, the LIDAR measurements are preprocessed and an object segmentation clusters the candidate objects present in the environment. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been designed and trained using an artificially generated dataset, computes the radius and the position of the center of individual circles in sensor coordinates. Finally, an indirect-EKF provides the estimate of the semantic map in world coordinates, including the velocity of the center of the circles in world coordinates.We have quantitative and qualitative evaluated the performance of our proposed situation awareness system by means of Software-In-The-Loop simulations using VRep with one and multiple static and moving cylindrical objects in the scene, obtaining results that support our proposed algorithm. In addition, we have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm is capable of handling real environments thanks to real laboratory experiments with non-cylindrical static (i.e. a barrel) and moving (i.e. a person) objects",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Deep learning based semantic situation awareness system for multirotor aerial robots using LIDAR,,10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8797770,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They started implementing a technology-centered educational system in order to expand their pedagogical approaches and increase the possibilities of creatively putting ideas together and innovatively conveying their knowledge to their students. In this paper, we explore the convergence of creativity, technology, with art and design education, and we advocate the use of digital tools and repurposing of social media applications to support creative thinking.

343666174,2019-10-01T00:00:00,"Con el objetivo de encontrar alimentos amigables para celíacos, el sorgo se presenta como un cereal con un alto contenido de nutrientes, que tiene varias propiedades beneficiosas, especialmente para aquellos países que carecen de otros cereales tradicionales como el trigo, el maíz o el arroz. Además, el cultivo del sorgo es económicamente rentable y no contiene las proteínas que afectan a los pacientes celíacos. En los últimos años, se ha desarrollado una variedad de productos alimenticios de “libre de gluten” para mejorar la dieta de los celíacos, como cervezas de sorgo, que a menudo son producidas de forma artesanal y a muy pequeña escala por cerveceros individuales. Sin embargo, hasta donde se conoce, no existe una bebida no alcohólica a base de sorgo. En este trabajo se propone un modelo matemático para el diseño óptimo de una planta discontinua de producción de malta a partir de sorgo a nivel industrial. El modelo se formula como un problema mixto entero lineal, el cual se implementa y resuelve en GAMS utilizando el resolvedor CPLEX. A través de resultados experimentales, se obtienen los parámetros de diseño y operación del modelo para desarrollar una formulación de ajuste real. Se minimiza el costo de inversión y se presenta un análisis técnico-social-económico con el objetivo de evaluar la opción más rentable y sostenible de producir malta a partir de sorgo. Para una producción de 5.000 L/d, el período de pago es de 4,8 años y el costo unitario por botella de 300 mL es de $ 0,312. La bebida de malta, obtenida con la tecnología presentada en este trabajo, cumple con los requisitos físicos y organolépticos establecidos para su consumo de acuerdo con la comparación reportada por Nieblas, con dos maltas de cebada comercializadas en Cuba malta Bucanero y Tínima.Amb l'objectiu de trobar aliments amigables per a celíacs, la sorgo es presenta com un cereal amb un alt contingut de nutrients, que té diverses propietats beneficioses, especialment per a aquells països que no tenen altres cereals tradicionals com el blat, el blat de moro o l'arròs. A més, el cultiu del sorgo és econòmicament rendible i no conté les proteïnes que afecten els pacients celíacs. En els últims anys, s'ha desenvolupat una varietat de productes alimentaris ""lliure de gluten"" per millorar la dieta dels celíacs, com cerveses de sorgo, que sovint són produïdes de forma artesanal i a molt petita escala per cervesers individuals. No obstant això, fins on es coneix, no existeix una beguda no alcohòlica a base de sorgo. En aquest treball es proposa un model matemàtic per al disseny òptim d'una planta discontínua de producció de malta a partir de sorgo a nivell industrial. El model es formula com un problema mixt sencer lineal, el qual s'implementa i resol en GAMS utilitzant el resolvedor CPLEX. A través de resultats experimentals, s'obtenen els paràmetres de disseny i operació del model per desenvolupar una formulació d'ajust real.

Per a una producció de 5.000 L/d, el període de pagament és de 4,8 anys i el cost unitari per ampolla de 300 ml és de 0,312 $. La beguda de malta, obtinguda amb la tecnologia presentada en aquest treball, compleix amb els requisits físics i organolèptics establerts per al seu consum d'acord amb la comparació reportada per Nieblas, amb dos maltes d'ordi comercialitzades a Cuba malta Bucanero i Tínima.With the aim of finding friendly celiac food, sorghum is presented as a cereal with a high content of nutrients, which has several beneficial properties, especially for those countries that lack other traditional cereals such as wheat, corn, or rice. In addition, sorghum cultivation is economically profitable and it does not contain the proteins that affect celiac patients. In the last years, a variety of ""free gluten"" food products were developed for improving the celiac diet, as well as sorghum beers, which are frequently produced in a home-made manner on a very small scale by individual brewers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a non-alcoholic beverage from sorghum. In this work, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a batch plant for producing malt drink from sorghum at industrial level is proposed. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, which is implemented and solved in GAMS using the CPLEX solver. Through experimental results, design and operation model parameters are obtained in order to develop real-fit formulation. The investment cost is minimized, and a technical-social-economical analysis is presented in order to evaluate the more profitable and sustainable option to produce malt drink from sorghum. For a production of 5,000 L/d, the payback period is equal to 4.8 years and the unit cost per bottle of 300 mL is $ 0.312. The obtained malt drink with technology presented in this work, meets the physical and organoleptics requirements established for its consumption according with the comparison reported by Nieblas, with two malt drinks from barley commercialized in Cuba, Bucanero and Tínima malt drink.Fil: Albernas Carvajal, Yailet.

In this paper we propose a pipeline for functional imaging in echocardiography consisting of four central components, (i) classification of cardiac view, (ii) semantic partitioning of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium, (iii) regional motion estimates and (iv) fusion of measurements. A U-Net type of convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to classify muscle tissue, and partitioned into a semantic measurement kernel based on LV length and ventricular orientation. Dense tissue motion was predicted using stacked U-Net architectures with image warping of intermediate flow, designed to tackle variable displacements. Training was performed on a mixture of real and synthetic data. The resulting segmentation and motion estimates was fused in a Kalman filter and used as basis for measuring global longitudinal strain. For reference, 2D ultrasound images from 21 subjects were acquired using a GE Vivid system. Data was analyzed by two specialists using a semi-automatic tool for longitudinal function estimates in a commercial system, and further compared to output of the proposed method. Qualitative assessment showed comparable deformation trends as the clinical analysis software. The average deviation for the global longitudinal strain was (−0.6±1.6 −0.6±1.6 )% for apical four-chamber view. The system was implemented with Tensorflow, and working in an end-to-end fashion without any ad-hoc tuning.

Often, a Keyword Spotting System (KWS) is used to detect specific wake-up words spoken by a user, as a simple user interface, or front-end layer to a larger speech recognition system. Yet, such KWS must be always active, hence imposing strict power and latency constraints. While deep learning algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) demonstrated excellent KWS accuracies, current implementations fail to fit in the tight embedded memory and power budgets. This paper presents Laika: the implementation of a KWS system using an LSTM accelerator designed in 65nm CMOS. For this application, an LSTM model is trained through a speech database and deployed on our custom, yet highly programmable LSTM accelerator. Approximate computing techniques further reduce power consumption, while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. Experimental results demonstrate a power consumption of less than 5μW for real-time KWS applications.status: publishe","[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1930-8833', '1930-8833']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Laika: A 5uW programmable LSTM accelerator for always-on keyword spotting in 65nm CMOS,,10.1109/ESSCIRC.2018.8494342,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, annotation is mostly performed by observers with medical background and is incredibly costly and time-consuming, creating a major bottleneck for the above-mentioned technologies. In this paper, we propose a way to eliminate, or at least limit, the human intervention in the annotation process.  Methods - Meaningful information about interaction between objects is inherently available in virtual reality environments. We propose a strategy to convert automatically this information into annotations in order to provide as output individual surgical process models.  Validation - We implemented our approach through a peg-transfer task simulator and compared it to manual annotations. To assess the impact of our contribution, we studied both intra- and inter-observer variability.  Results and conclusion - In average, manual annotations took more than 12 min for 1 min of video to achieve low-level physical activity annotation, whereas automatic annotation is achieved in less than a second for the same video period.

(2D) crystals, for which the shape is described
by two linear sizes, are common in fine chemical and pharmaceutical
industries. Since the crystal size and shape are directly related
to the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the simultaneous
size and shape distribution control is of paramount importance in
pharmaceutical crystallization engineering. To efficiently achieve
simultaneous size and shape control often requires model-based control
strategies; however, the increased computational cost of the process
simulation and the substantial differences between the simulated and
measurable quantities make the implementation of model-based control
approaches challenging. This paper addresses the important problem
of the real-time simulation of the most likely measurable chord length
distribution (CLD) and aspect ratio distribution (ARD) as well as
the concentration variations during the crystallization of 2D needle-shaped
crystals. This enables the application of focused beam reflectance
measurement (FBRM) and particle vision and microscopy (PVM), two routinely
applied probes, as quantitative direct feedback control tools. Artificial
neural network (ANN)-based FBRM and PVM soft-sensors are developed,
which enable the direct and fast transformation of 2D crystal size
distribution (CSD) to CLD and ARD on arbitrary 2D grids. The training
data for the ANN are generated by a first principle, geometrical model-based
simulation of FBRM and PVM for high aspect ratio crystals, although
the ANN approach is applicable for any simulated or experimental training
data sets. It is also demonstrated that the in situ imaging-based
shape measurement underestimates the real aspect ratio (AR) of crystals,
for which a simple correction is proposed. From the model-equation
solution perspective, the soft-sensors require full population balance

The use of flying platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, is rapidly growing. In particular, with their inherent attributes such as mobility, flexibility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs admit several key potential applications in wireless systems. On the one hand, UAVs can be used as aerial base stations to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless communications is presented. Moreover, the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly investigated. In particular, the key UAV challenges such as 3D deployment, performance analysis, channel modeling, and energy efficiency are explored along with representative results. Then, open problems and potential research directions pertaining to UAV communications are introduced. Finally, various analytical frameworks and mathematical tools, such as optimization theory, machine learning, stochastic geometry, transport theory, and game theory are described. The use of such tools for addressing unique UAV problems is also presented.

228048463,2019-07-22T00:00:00,"International audienceHuman-centric applications such as virtual reality and immersive gaming will be central to the future wireless networks. Common features of such services include: a) their dependence on the human user's behavior and state, and b) their need for more network resources compared to conventional cellular applications. To successfully deploy such applications over wireless and cellular systems, the network must be made cognizant of not only the quality-of-service (QoS) needs of the applications, but also of the perceptions of the human users on this QoS. In this paper, by explicitly modeling the limitations of the human brain, a concrete measure for the delay perception of human users in a wireless network is introduced. Then, a novel learning method, called probability distribution identification, is proposed to find a probabilistic model for this delay perception based on the brain features of a human user. The proposed learning method uses both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to build a Gaussian mixture model of the human brain features. Given a model for the delay perception of the human brain, a novel brain-aware resource management algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization is proposed for allocating radio resources to human users while minimizing the transmit power and taking into account the reliability of both machine type devices and human users.

There is high demand for tracking running performance and progress for amateurs and professionals alike. The parameters velocity and distance are thereby of main interest. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of four algorithms, which calculate the stride velocity and stride length during running using data of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed in the midsole of a running shoe. The four algorithms are based on stride time, foot acceleration, foot trajectory estimation, and deep learning, respectively. They are compared using two studies: a laboratory-based study comprising 2377 strides from 27 subjects with 3D motion tracking as a reference and a field study comprising 12 subjects performing a 3.2-km run in a real-world setup. The results show that the foot trajectory estimation algorithm performs best, achieving a mean error of 0.032 ± 0.274 m/s for the velocity estimation and 0.022 ± 0.157 m for the stride length. An interesting alternative for systems with a low energy budget is the acceleration-based approach.

187742851,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"A key requirement of autonomous vehicles is the capability to safely navigate in their environment. However, outside of controlled environments, safe navigation is a very difficult problem. In particular, the real-world often contains both complex 3D structure, and dynamic obstacles such as people or other vehicles. Dynamic obstacles are particularly challenging, as a principled solution requires planning trajectories with regard to both vehicle dynamics, and the motion of the obstacles. Additionally, the real-time requirements imposed by obstacle motion, coupled with real-world computational limitations, make classical optimality and completeness guarantees difficult to satisfy. We present a unified optimization-based motion planning and control solution, that can navigate in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. By combining optimal and receding-horizon control, with temporal multi-resolution lattices, we can precompute optimal motion primitives, and allow real-time planning of physically-feasible trajectories in complex environments with dynamic obstacles. We demonstrate the framework by solving difficult indoor 3D quadcopter navigation scenarios, where it is necessary to plan in time. Including waiting on, and taking detours around, the motions of other people and quadcopters.This work was partially supported by FFI/VINNOVA, the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) project Symbicloud, the ELLIIT Excellence Center at Linköping-Lund for Information Technology, Swedish Research Council (VR) Linnaeus Center CADICS, and the National Graduate School in Computer Science, Sweden (CUGS).</p",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Receding-Horizon Lattice-based Motion Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,,10.1109/CDC.2018.8618964,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the recognition of gestures in video sequences is a problem still open, because current detection methods achieve low scores when the background is undefined or in unstructured scenarios. Deep learning techniques are being applied to approach a solution for this problem in recent years. In this paper, we present a study in which we analyse the performance of a 3DCNN architecture for hand gesture recognition in an unstructured scenario.

The final version is available from Nature Research via the DOI in this record.Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data.Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)European CommissionDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG","[{'title': 'Nature', 'identifiers': ['issn:0028-0836', '0028-0836']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',All-optical spiking neurosynaptic networks with self-learning capabilities,https://core.ac.uk/download/200765967.pdf,10.1038/s41586-019-1157-8,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This is especially true in industrial sector. Machine Health Monitoring (MHM) was created. The primary goal of MHM is to ensure that all devices within an Industrial IoT (IIoT) implementation are functioning as expected at all times. For our specific usage of MHM, we are monitoring various readings from a 3D printer. We have currently implemented an array of sensors, and a live camera feed, with an accelerometer and a power meter soon to come. We have also created a web server running off of a Raspberry Pi 3 to hold our database and provide accessibility to the data. Through this setup, a user could access our storage and view up to the last 60 readings from the sensors in real time. The user can also view the live camera feed. We plan to use that range to implement fault detection with an alert system. We also look to eventually add predictive AI in an attempt to prevent faults before they occur. We believe our implementation provides a more cost-effective and scalable architecture for MHM. It also provides large amounts of customizability and adaptability due to our usage of generalized sensor data inputs and storage.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to perform medical image classification and assist clinicians in diagnosing radiological scans. In this paper, we apply 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) to classify computed tomography (CT) brain scans into normal scans (N) and abnormal scans containing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), acute subdural hemorrhage (ASDH) and brain polytrauma hemorrhage (BPH). The dataset used consists of 399 volumetric CT brain images representing approximately 12,000 images from the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. We used a 3D CNN to perform both 2-class (normal versus a specific abnormal class) and 4-class classification (between normal, SAH, IPH, ASDH). We apply image thresholding at the image pre-processing step, that improves 3D CNN classification accuracy and performance by accentuating the pixel intensities that contribute most to feature discrimination. For 2-class classification, the F1 scores for various pairs of medical diagnoses ranged from 0.706 to 0.902 without thresholding. With thresholding implemented, the F1 scores improved and ranged from 0.919 to 0.952. Our results are comparable to, and in some cases, exceed the results published in other work applying 3D CNN to CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan classification.

ElsevierOne of the major challenges that faces today regulatory risk assessment is to speed up the way of assessing threshold sublethal detrimental effects of existing and new chemical products. Recently advances in imaging allows to monitor in real time the behaviour of individuals under a given stress. Light is a common stress for many different organisms. Fish larvae and many invertebrate species respond to light altering their behaviour. The water flea Daphnia magna as many other zooplanktonic species has a marked diel vertical phototactic swimming behaviour against light due to fish predation. The aim of this study was to develop a high throughput image analysis to study changes in the vertical swimming behaviour to light of D. magna first reproductive adult females exposed to 0.1 and 1 µg/L of four psychiatric drugs: diazepam, fluoxetine, propranolol and carbamazepine during their entire life. Experiments were conducted using a new custom designed vertical oriented four 50 mL chamber device controlled by the Noldus software (Netherlands). Changes in speed, preferred area (bottom vs upper areas) and animal aggregation were analysed using groups of animals under consecutive periods of dark and apical light stimulus of different intensities. Obtained results indicated that light intensity increased the speed but low light intensities allowed to better discriminate individual responses to the studied drugs. The four tested drugs decreased the response of exposed organisms to light: individuals move less, were closer to the bottom and at low light intensities were closer each other. At high light intensities, however, exposed individuals were less aggregated. Propranolol, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were the compounds effecting most the behaviour. Our results indicated that psychiatric drugs at environmental relevant concentrations alter the vertical phototactic behaviour of D. magna individuals and that it is possible to develop appropriate high-throughput image analysis devices to measure those responses.Peer Reviewe","[{'title': 'The Science of The Total Environment', 'identifiers': ['issn:0048-9697', '0048-9697']}]",'Elsevier BV',Using a new high-throughput video-tracking platform to assess behavioural changes in Daphnia magna exposed to neuro-active drugs,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.187,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

to improve the human-machine interface. Taking into account
the limitations of current automatic speech recognition systems,

Among them, a combination of spiking neural networks and

obtained from a neuromorphic cochlea.
The system was trained and tested with a large dataset
that contains ”left” and ”right” speech commands, achieving
89.90% accuracy. A novel spiking neural network model has been
proposed to adapt the network that has been trained with static

In scenarios where a CNN is deployed on mobile devices, models are presented with new challenges due to lighting and orientation. It is essential for model assessment to be conducted in real world conditions if such models are to be reliably integrated with computer vision products for plant disease phenotyping. We train a CNN object detection model to identify foliar symptoms of diseases in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We then deploy the model in a mobile app and test its performance on mobile images and video of 720 diseased leaflets in an agricultural field in Tanzania. Within each disease category we test two levels of severity of symptoms-mild and pronounced, to assess the model performance for early detection of symptoms. In both severities we see a decrease in performance for real world images and video as measured with the F-1 score. The F-1 score dropped by 32% for pronounced symptoms in real world images (the closest data to the training data) due to a decrease in model recall. If the potential of mobile CNN models are to be realized our data suggest it is crucial to consider tuning recall in order to achieve the desired performance in real world settings.

The current de-facto design practice for such architectures is to extend the ISA and the corresponding microarchitecture with custom instructions to efficiently manage the complex tasks imposed by IoT applications, i.e., augmented reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, within narrow energy and area budgets. However, the new IoT application domain also offers a unique opportunity to revisit and optimize the RISC microarchitectural design flow from a more communication- and memory-centric viewpoint.

A vast amount of systems aiming to enhance the learning process of a musical instrument are being developed in the recent years. However, most of the systems focus on the assessment of pitch and onset accuracy, and very few pay attention to tone quality. This is particularly true in violin music education, where although a consensus exist on what is a good or a bad tone quality, there is not a formal definition due to its subjectivity. We present a machine learning approach for the automatic assessment of violin tone quality. We depart from our previous work on the preliminary modelling of several dimensions involving tone quality. Based on recorded examples of tones with different qualities defined and recorded by a professional violinist, we applied machine learning techniques to learn computational models able to evaluate tone quality from extracted audio features. The tone quality models were implemented into a real-time-visual-feedback system.This work has been partly sponsored by the Spanish TIN project TIMUL (TIN2013-48152-C2-2-R), the

Hearing loss, a partial or total inability to hear, is one of the most commonly reported disabilities. A hearing test can be carried out by an audiologist to assess a patient’s auditory system. However, the procedure requires an appointment, which can result in delays and practitioner fees. In addition, there are often challenges associated with the unavailability of equipment and qualified practitioners, particularly in remote areas. This paper presents a novel idea that automatically identifies any hearing impairment based on a cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition approach. The proposed system uses an adaptive filter bank with weighted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for feature extraction. The adaptive filter bank implementation is inspired by the principle of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio that is aware of its environment and adapts to statistical variations in the input stimuli by learning from the environment. Comparative performance evaluation demonstrates the potential of our automated hearing test method to achieve comparable results to the clinical ground truth, established by the expert audiologist’s tests. The overall absolute error of the proposed model when compared with the expert audiologist test is less than 4.9 dB and 4.4 dB for the pure tone and speech audiometry tests, respectively. The overall accuracy achieved is 96.67% with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The proposed method potentially offers a second opinion to audiologists, and serves as a cost-effective pre-screening test to predict hearing loss at an early stage. In future work, authors intend to explore the application of advanced deep learning and optimization approaches to further enhance the performance of the automated testing prototype considering imperfect datasets with real-world background noise.Published versio","[{'title': 'Cognitive Computation', 'identifiers': ['issn:1866-9964', '1866-9956', '1866-9964', 'issn:1866-9956']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition for automated hearing loss testing,https://core.ac.uk/download/286356367.pdf,10.1007/s12559-018-9607-4,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
148807974,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"A real-time visual servo tracking system for an industrial robot has been implemented using PSD (Position Sensitive Detector) cameras, neural networks, and an extended trapezoidal motion planning method. PSD and directly transduces the light&apos;s projected position on its sensor plane into an analog current and lends itself to fast real-time tracking. A neural network, after proper training, transforms the PSD sensor reading into a 3D position of the target, which is then input to an extended trapezoidal motion planning algorithm. This algorithm implements a continuous motion update strategy in response to an ever-changing sensor information from the moving target, while greatly reducing the tracking delay. This planning method is found to be very useful for sensor-based control such as moving target tracking or weld-seam tracking in which the robot needs to change its motion in real time in response to incoming sensor information. Further, for real-time usage of the neural net, a new architecture called LANN (Locally Activated Neural Network) has been developed based on the concept of CMAC input partitioning and local learning. Experimental evidence shows that an industrial robot can smoothly track a moving target of unknown motion with speeds of up to 1 m/s and with oscillation frequency up to 5 Hz.X1113sciescopu","[{'title': 'Applied Intelligence', 'identifiers': ['issn:0924-669X', '0924-669x']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Real-time dynamic visual tracking using PSD sensors and extended trapezoidal motion planning,,10.1023/A:1008385515068,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

237690220,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) there is a growing interest in the use of the Building Information Modelling (BIM). Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, BIM can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, BIM is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility Management (FM). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in FM. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of FM operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image Recognition (ImR), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data. This data has been stored in a BIM model, employed as single reliable source of information for FM. This integration can enhance maintenance management contracts if the BIM model is coupled with a smart contract. Far from being a comprehensive case study, this research demonstrates how the transition from BIM to the Asset Information Model (AIM) and, finally, to the Digital Twin (i.e. a near-real-time digital clone of a physical asset, of its conditions and processes) is desirable because of the outstanding benefits that have already been measured in other industrial sectors by applying the principles of Industry 4.0",,'WITPRESS LTD.',Office building occupancy monitoring through image recognition sensors,,10.2495/SAFE-V9-N4-371-380,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

224840689,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"PURPOSE: The use of neural networks to directly predict three-dimensional dose distributions for automatic planning is becoming popular. However, the existing methods use only patient anatomy as input and assume consistent beam configuration for all patients in the training database. The purpose of this work was to develop a more general model that considers variable beam configurations in addition to patient anatomy to achieve more comprehensive automatic planning with a potentially easier clinical implementation, without the need to train specific models for different beam settings. METHODS: The proposed anatomy and beam (AB) model is based on our newly developed deep learning architecture, and hierarchically densely connected U-Net (HD U-Net), which combines U-Net and DenseNet. The AB model contains 10 input channels: one for beam setup and the other 9 for anatomical information (PTV and organs). The beam setup information is represented by a 3D matrix of the non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. We used a set of images from 129 patients with lung cancer treated with IMRT with heterogeneous beam configurations (4-9 beams of various orientations) for training/validation (100 patients) and testing (29 patients). Mean squared error was used as the loss function. We evaluated the model's accuracy by comparing the mean dose, maximum dose, and other relevant dose-volume metrics for the predicted dose distribution against those of the clinically delivered dose distribution. Dice similarity coefficients were computed to address the spatial correspondence of the isodose volumes between the predicted and clinically delivered doses. The model was also compared with our previous work, the anatomy only (AO) model, which does not consider beam setup information and uses only 9 channels for anatomical information. RESULTS: The AB model outperformed the AO model, especially in the low and medium dose regions. In terms of dose-volume metrics, AB outperformed AO by about 1-2%. The largest improvement was found to be about 5% in lung volume receiving a dose of 5Gy or more (V5 ). The improvement for spinal cord maximum dose was also important, that is, 3.6% for cross-validation and 2.6% for testing. The AB model achieved Dice scores for isodose volumes as much as 10% higher than the AO model in low and medium dose regions and about 2-5% higher in high dose regions. CONCLUSIONS: The AO model, which does not use beam configuration as input, can still predict dose distributions with reasonable accuracy in high dose regions but introduces large errors in low and medium dose regions for IMRT cases with variable beam numbers and orientations. The proposed AB model outperforms the AO model substantially in low and medium dose regions, and slightly in high dose regions, by considering beam setup information through a cumulative non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. This new model represents a major step forward towards predicting 3D dose distributions in real clinical practices, where beam configuration could vary from patient to patient, from planner to planner, and from institution to institution",,'Wiley',Three-dimensional dose prediction for lung IMRT patients with deep neural networks: robust learning from heterogeneous beam configurations,,10.1002/mp.13597,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Finally, an indirect-EKF provides the estimate of the semantic map in world coordinates, including the velocity of the center of the circles in world coordinates.We have quantitative and qualitative evaluated the performance of our proposed situation awareness system by means of Software-In-The-Loop simulations using VRep with one and multiple static and moving cylindrical objects in the scene, obtaining results that support our proposed algorithm. In addition, we have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm is capable of handling real environments thanks to real laboratory experiments with non-cylindrical static (i.e. a barrel) and moving (i.e. a person) objects",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Deep learning based semantic situation awareness system for multirotor aerial robots using LIDAR,https://oa.upm.es/64575/,10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8797770,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

442409320,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Within the strongly regulated avionic engineering field, conventional graphical desktop hardware and software application programming interface (API) cannot be used because they do not conform to the avionic certification standards. We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge. As proven by previous hardware emulation tools, there is also a potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine early in the development cycle. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by predictive software running on a desktop computer. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL Safety Critical API. First, we create nonparametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames per second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated. To validate our models, we render an industrial scene with characteristic combinations not used during the training phase and we compare the predictions to those real values. We find a median prediction error of less than 4 FPS","[{'title': 'Scientific Programming', 'identifiers': ['1058-9244', 'issn:1058-9244', '1875-919x', 'issn:1875-919X']}]",'Hindawi Limited',Avionics Graphics Hardware Performance Prediction with Machine Learning,,10.1155/2019/9195845,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Learning is here used to improve both the IoT network capability to support a larger number of objects as well as the autonomy of IoT devices. We first illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in a proof-of-concept based on USRP software radio platforms operating on real radio signals. It shows how collisions with other RF signals present in the ISM band are diminished for a given IoT device. Then we describe the first implementation of learning algorithms on LoRa devices operating in a real LoRaWAN network, that we named IoTligent. The proposed solution adds neither processing overhead so that it can be ran in the IoT devices, nor network overhead so that no change is required to LoRaWAN. Real life experiments have been done in a realistic LoRa network and they show that IoTligent device battery life can be extended by a factor 2 in the scenarios we faced during our experiment.L'article décrit les principes et les résultats de la mise en œuvre d'algorithmes d'apprentissage par renforcement sur des appareils de l'Internet des Objets pour l'atténuation des collisions radio dans les bandes non licenciées ISM.

Despite all efforts to develop sustainable monitoring systems, there is still a lack of low cost, continuous and real time devices that demonstrate potential for large-scale implementation in wide water distribution networks. The following work presents a study of a low-cost, optofluidic sensor, based on Trypthopan Intrinsic Fluorescence. The fluorospectrometry analysis performed (before sensor development) supports the existence of a measurable fluorescence output signal originating from the tryptophan contained within pathogenic bacteria. The sensor was mounted using a rapid prototyping technique (3D printing), and the integrated optical system was achieved with low-cost optical components. The sensor performance was evaluated with spiked laboratory samples containing E. coli and Legionella, in both continuous and non-continuous flow situations. Results have shown a linear relationship between the signal measured and pathogen concentration, with limits of detection at 1.4 × 103 CFU/mL. The time delay between contamination and detection of the bacteria was practically null. Therefore, this study supports the potential application of tryptophan for monitoring drinking water against water pathogens. View Full-Text

395142972,2019-08-11T00:00:00,"[EN] Modelling the dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles, such as buses or trucks, can be very useful for driving simulation and training, autonomous driving, crash analysis, etc. However, dynamic modelling of a vehicle is a difficult task because there are many subsystems and signals that affect its behaviour. In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

186351804,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Urban planning is central to flood risk prevention. Flood-sensitive urban planning pursues two goals: reducing flood exposure and vulnerability [1]; but also addressing the influence of urban characteristics on flood flow severity (flow depths and velocities) [2]. Focusing on the latter, we present here a unique software which automatically optimizes the geometry of urban layouts to enhance flood resilience [3]. The optimized parameters describe the arrangement of the road network, the blocks, the parcels, and the buildings. The proposed approach is particularly innovative since, so far, such automatic urban design tools were developed only for totally different objectives (e.g. optimizing sun exposure or distance to parks); but not in the context of flood risk management.
Our automatic urban design system consists of three components: (i) a procedural urban model, (ii) a surrogate for a hydraulic model and (iii) an optimization engine.
•	Starting from a set of input parameters pi (typical road length, width, curvature …) the procedural urban model generates urban layouts which mimic fairly realistically real-world urban patterns [3].
•	To achieve interactive feedback (i.e. getting the results within a few seconds), the system uses a neural network (NN) to approximate the relationship between urban layout and flood flow characteristics. The NN was trained using a relatively fast 2D porosity-based hydraulic model [4], which in turn was calibrated against a detailed shallow-water model [2].
•	A Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization is used to adjust iteratively the procedural model parameters pi so as to yield the desired urban layout.
The system was tested for optimizing the layout of an urban district of 1 km by 1 km subject to river flooding. The system runs about one minute to find the optimal urban layout. The system tends to improve the flow conveyance through the urban area by increasing the voids in-between the buildings (e.g., increase road width) and by promoting a more “fragmented” urban pattern (e.g., decrease road length). The optimization reduces the flood water depths in the district by up to 20 to 25%.
Several real-world examples showcase the operationality of the system for improving flood resilience through flood-sensitive urban design [3]. In practice, such an interactive digital tool can valuably assist urban planners and architects to assess the implications of various design decisions on flooding and end up with improved flood-sensitive urban layouts. The approach should be further developed to accommodate more diverse flooding scenarios (e.g. pluvial floods, coastal floods, etc.).

Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s.

Augmented reality works on the basis of two stages: object recognition and marker tracking. Recognition occurs on the basis of machine learning and tracking of markers by finding certain elements or special markers. The analogue of this principle of operation is SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building). But the best results are achieved with the simultaneous use of two technologies. AR is involved in different areas: education, medicine, entertainment, military training. For education, three-dimensional 3D models are used, which are more visual for students and simplify their studies. In entertainment, AR has found a place for itself in various social networks in the form of masks (Snapchat), games (Pokemon GO) and others. In medicine, in addition to training, AR is used to visualize the internal organs of patients.

275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

186557169,2019-02-04T09:03:07,"none14noIn the last few years, polymerase chain reaction analysis is frequently required to improve the detection of pathogen infections in central nervous system as a potential cause of neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The goal of this paper is to set up a fast, cheap and reliable molecular approach for qualitative detection of six neurotropic pathogens. A method based on PCR has been designed and implemented to guarantee the qualitative DNA detection of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSVI/II), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), rubella virus (RUBV) and Toxoplasma gondii in the cerebrospinal fluid, where otherwise they are barely detectable. Each PCR assay was tested using dilutions of positive controls, which demonstrated a sensitivity allowing to detect up to 102 copies/ml in PCR and 10 copies/ml in real-time PCR for each pathogen. Once been set up, the protocol was applied to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid from 100 patients with suspected infectious diseases of the central nervous system and 50 patients without any infection. The method allowed to identify 17 positive cerebrospinal fluid with polymerase chain reaction and 22 with real-time PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Therefore, application of RT PCR allows a fast and sensitive evaluation of neurotropic DNA pathogens in the course of diagnostic routine within neurological units.PubMed ID:28854791noneFerese R; Scorzolini L; Campopiano R; Albano V; Griguoli A M; Giardina E; Scala S; Ryskalin L; D'Alessio C; Zampatti S; Fantozzi R; Storto M; Fornai F; Gambardella SFerese, R; Scorzolini, L; Campopiano, R; Albano, V; Griguoli, A M; Giardina, E; Scala, S; Ryskalin, L; D'Alessio, C; Zampatti, S; Fantozzi, R; Storto, M; Fornai, F; Gambardella, ",,"'AEPress, s.r.o.'",PCR-based approach for qualitative molecular analysis of six neurotropic pathogens,,10.4149/av_2017_305,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275646691,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Computer clusters are widely used platforms to execute different computational workloads. Indeed, the advent of virtualization and Cloud computing has paved the way to deploy virtual elastic clusters on top of Cloud infrastructures, which are typically backed by physical computing clusters. In turn, the advances in Green computing have fostered the ability to dynamically power on the nodes of physical clusters as required. Therefore, this paper introduces an open-source framework to deploy elastic virtual clusters running on elastic physical clusters where the computing capabilities of the virtual clusters are dynamically changed to satisfy both the user application's computing requirements and to minimise the amount of energy consumed by the underlying physical cluster that supports an on-premises Cloud. For that, we integrate: i) an elasticity manager both at the infrastructure level (power management) and at the virtual infrastructure level (horizontal elasticity); ii) an automatic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation agent that reduces the amount of powered on physical nodes using live migration and iii) a vertical elasticity manager to dynamically and transparently change the memory allocated to VMs, thus fostering enhanced consolidation. A case study based on real datasets executed on a production infrastructure is used to validate the proposed solution. The results show that a multi-elastic virtualized datacenter provides users with the ability to deploy customized scalable computing clusters while reducing its energy footprint.The results of this work have been partially supported by ATMOSPHERE (Adaptive, Trustworthy, Manageable, Orchestrated, Secure, Privacy-assuring Hybrid, Ecosystem for Resilient Cloud Computing), funded by the European Commission under the Cooperation Programme, Horizon 2020 grant agreement No 777154.Alfonso Laguna, CD.; Caballer Fernández, M.; Calatrava Arroyo, A.; Moltó, G.; Blanquer Espert, I.

ElsevierOne of the major challenges that faces today regulatory risk assessment is to speed up the way of assessing threshold sublethal detrimental effects of existing and new chemical products. Recently advances in imaging allows to monitor in real time the behaviour of individuals under a given stress. Light is a common stress for many different organisms. Fish larvae and many invertebrate species respond to light altering their behaviour. The water flea Daphnia magna as many other zooplanktonic species has a marked diel vertical phototactic swimming behaviour against light due to fish predation. The aim of this study was to develop a high throughput image analysis to study changes in the vertical swimming behaviour to light of D. magna first reproductive adult females exposed to 0.1 and 1 µg/L of four psychiatric drugs: diazepam, fluoxetine, propranolol and carbamazepine during their entire life. Experiments were conducted using a new custom designed vertical oriented four 50 mL chamber device controlled by the Noldus software (Netherlands). Changes in speed, preferred area (bottom vs upper areas) and animal aggregation were analysed using groups of animals under consecutive periods of dark and apical light stimulus of different intensities. Obtained results indicated that light intensity increased the speed but low light intensities allowed to better discriminate individual responses to the studied drugs. The four tested drugs decreased the response of exposed organisms to light: individuals move less, were closer to the bottom and at low light intensities were closer each other. At high light intensities, however, exposed individuals were less aggregated. Propranolol, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were the compounds effecting most the behaviour. Our results indicated that psychiatric drugs at environmental relevant concentrations alter the vertical phototactic behaviour of D. magna individuals and that it is possible to develop appropriate high-throughput image analysis devices to measure those responses.Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft","[{'title': 'The Science of The Total Environment', 'identifiers': ['issn:0048-9697', '0048-9697']}]",'Elsevier BV',Using a new high-throughput video-tracking platform to assess behavioural changes in Daphnia magna exposed to neuro-active drugs,https://core.ac.uk/download/294829072.pdf,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.187,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Indeed, computational aspects represent a major issue, as hand grasp analysis is expected to support grasping systems that are hosted on low-power embedded systems. This paper proposes a framework for video-based grasping classification that is designed for implementation on resourceconstrained devices. The framework adopts a fully data-driven strategy and relies on deep learning to deal with advanced analysis of video signals. Nonetheless, the overall design takes advantage of CNN architectures that can cope with the constraints imposed by embedded systems. The experimental session involved a real-world dataset containing daily life activities collected using egocentric perspective. In addition, the complete inference system is implemented on a NVIDIA Jetson-TX2 obtaining real time performances. The results confirm that the proposed system can suitably balance the trade off between accuracy and computational costs",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Data-Driven Video Grasping Classification for Low-Power Embedded System,,10.1109/ICECS46596.2019.8964645,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

research on Assisted Living Technology in smart homes for older
adults with mild cognitive impairments or dementia. We present
our field trial, the set-up for collecting and storing data from real
homes, and preliminary results on action recognition using low
resolution depth video cameras. The data have been collected
from seven apartments with one resident each over a period
of two weeks. We propose a pre-processing of the depth videos
by applying an Infinite Response Filter (IIR) for extracting the
movements in the frames prior to classification. In this work
we classify four actions: TV interaction (turn it on/ off and
switch over), standing up, sitting down, and no movement. Our
first results indicate that using the IIR filter for movement
information extraction improves accuracy and can be an efficient
method for recognizing actions. Our current implementation uses
a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural
network, and achieved an average peak accuracy of 86%",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Action Recognition in Real Homes using Low Resolution Depth Video Data,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
