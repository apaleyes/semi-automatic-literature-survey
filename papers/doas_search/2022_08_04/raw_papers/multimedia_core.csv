480333455,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings new opportunities for collecting real-time data and deploying machine learning models. Nonetheless, an individual IoT device may not have adequate computing resources to train and deploy an entire learning model. At the same time, transmitting continuous real-time data to a central server with high computing resource incurs enormous communication costs and raises issues in data security and privacy. Federated learning, a distributed machine learning framework, is a promising solution to train machine learning models with resource-limited devices and edge servers. Yet, the majority of existing works assume an impractically synchronous parameter update manner with homogeneous IoT nodes under stable communication connections. In this paper, we develop an asynchronous federated learning scheme to improve training efficiency for heterogeneous IoT devices under unstable communication network. Particularly, we formulate an asynchronous federated learning model and develop a lightweight node selection algorithm to carry out learning tasks effectively. The proposed algorithm iteratively selects heterogeneous IoT nodes to participate in the global learning aggregation while considering their local computing resource and communication condition. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed asynchronous federated learning scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes in various settings on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and non-i.i.d. data distribution","[{'title': 'Digital Communications and Networks', 'identifiers': ['2352-8648', 'issn:2352-8648']}]",'Elsevier BV',Towards asynchronous federated learning for heterogeneous edge-powered internet of things,10.1016/j.dcan.2021.04.001,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480154226,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Abstract This article proposes a new parallel performance model for different workloads of Spark Big Data applications running on Hadoop clusters. The proposed model can predict the runtime for generic workloads as a function of the number of executors, without necessarily knowing how the algorithms were implemented. For a certain problem size, it is shown that a model based on serial boundaries for a 2D arrangement of executors can fit the empirical data for various workloads. The empirical data was obtained from a real Hadoop cluster, using Spark and HiBench. The workloads used in this work were included WordCount, SVM, Kmeans, PageRank and Graph (Nweight). A particular runtime pattern emerged when adding more executors to run a job. For some workloads, the runtime was longer with more executors added. This phenomenon is predicted with the new model of parallelisation. The resulting equation from the model explains certain performance patterns that do not fit Amdahl’s law predictions, nor Gustafson’s equation. The results show that the proposed model achieved the best fit with all workloads and most of the data sizes, using the R-squared metric for the accuracy of the fitting of empirical data. The proposed model has advantages over machine learning models due to its simplicity, requiring a smaller number of experiments to fit the data. This is very useful to practitioners in the area of Big Data because they can predict runtime of specific applications by analysing the logs. In this work, the model is limited to changes in the number of executors for a fixed problem size","[{'title': 'Journal Of Big Data', 'identifiers': ['2196-1115', 'issn:2196-1115']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A parallelization model for performance characterization of Spark Big Data jobs on Hadoop clusters,10.1186/s40537-021-00499-7,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
440882566,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"An axial piston pump fault diagnosis algorithm based on empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is presented. The fault vibration signals and pressure signals of axial piston pump are taken as the analysis objects. Firstly, the original signals are decomposed by EWT, and each signal component is screened and reconstructed according to the energy characteristics. Then, the time-domain features and the frequency-domain features of the denoised signal are extracted, and features of time domain and frequency domain are fused. Finally, the 1D-CNN model was deployed to the WISE-Platform as a Service (WISE-PaaS) cloud platform to realize the real-time fault diagnosis of axial piston pump based on the cloud platform. Compared with ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), the results show that the axial piston pump fault diagnosis algorithm based on EWT and 1D-CNN has higher fault identification accuracy","[{'title': 'Shock and Vibration', 'identifiers': ['issn:1070-9622', '1875-9203', '1070-9622', 'issn:1875-9203']}]",'Hindawi Limited',Hydraulic Pump Fault Diagnosis Method Based on EWT Decomposition Denoising and Deep Learning on Cloud Platform,10.1155/2021/6674351,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491039194,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Recent advancements in the domain of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and rollout of next-generation networks have necessitated the requirement for the upkeep of latency-critical application architectures in future networks and communications. While Cloud service providers recognize the evolving mission-critical requirements in latency sensitive verticals such as autonomous driving, multimedia, gaming, telecommunications, and virtual reality, there is a wide gap to bridge the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints for the end-user experience. Most latency-critical services are over-provisioned on all fronts to offer reliability, which is inefficient towards scalability in the long run. To address this, we propose a strategy to model frequent violations on the application level as a multi-output target to enable more complex decision-making in the management of virtualised communication networks. In this work, we utilize data from a real-world deployment to configure and draft a realistic set of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for a voice based NFV application, and develop a deep neural network based multi-label classification methodology to identify and predict multiple categories of SLO breaches associated with an application state. With this, we aim to gain granular SLA and SLO violation insights, enabling us to study and mitigate their impact and inform precision in drafting proactive scaling policies. We further compare the performance against a set of multi-label compatible machine learning classifiers, and address class imbalance in a multi-label setup. We perform a comprehensive evaluation to assess the performance on example-based, label-based and ranking-based measures, and demonstrate the suitability of deep learning in such a use-case","[{'title': 'IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society', 'identifiers': ['2644-125x', 'issn:2644-125X']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',A Deep Neural Network-Based Multi-Label Classifier for SLA Violation Prediction in a Latency Sensitive NFV Application,10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3122844,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

482723796,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Many emerging applications of nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a few form-factor, revolve around safely interacting with humans in complex scenarios, for example, monitoring their activities or looking after people needing care. Such sophisticated autonomous functionality must be achieved while dealing with severe constraints in payload, battery, and power budget ( 100). In this work, we attack a complex task going from perception to control: to estimate and maintain the nano-UAV’s relative 3D pose with respect to a person while they freely move in the environment – a task that, to the best of our knowledge, has never previously been targeted with fully onboard computation on a nano-sized UAV. Our approach is centered around a novel vision-based deep neural network (DNN), called PULP-Frontnet, designed for deployment on top of a parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) processor aboard a nano-UAV. We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to 135frame/), consuming less than 87 for processing at peak throughput and down to 0.43/frame in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-grams Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV.

490727938,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"In recent years, there has been an immense amount of research into fall event detection. Generally, a fall event is defined as a situation in which a person unintentionally drops down onto a lower surface. It is crucial to detect the occurrence of fall events as early as possible so that any severe fall consequences can be minimized. Nonetheless, a fall event is a sporadic incidence that occurs seldomly that is falsely detected due to a wide range of fall conditions and situations. Therefore, an automated fall frame detection system, which is referred to as the SmartConvFall is proposed to detect the exact fall frame in a video sequence. It is crucial to know the exact fall frame as it dictates the response time of the system to administer an early treatment to reduce the fall’s negative consequences and related injuries. Henceforth, searching for the optimal training configurations is imperative to ensure the main goal of the SmartConvFall is achieved. The proposed SmartConvFall consists of two parts, which are object tracking and instantaneous fall frame detection modules that rely on deep learning representations. The first stage will track the object of interest using a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) tracker. Various training configurations such as optimizer, learning rate, mini-batch size, number of training samples, and region of interest are individually evaluated to determine the best configuration to produce the best tracker model. Meanwhile, the second module goal is to determine the exact instantaneous fall frame by modeling the continuous object trajectories using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Similarly, the LSTM model will undergo various training configurations that cover different types of features selection and the number of stacked layers. The exact instantaneous fall frame is determined using an assumption that a large movement difference with respect to the ground level along the vertical axis can be observed if a fall incident happened. The proposed SmartConvFall is a novel technique as most of the existing methods still relying on detection rather than the tracking module. The SmartConvFall outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers, namely TCNN and MDNET-N trackers, with the highest expected average overlap, robustness, and reliability metrics of 0.1619, 0.6323, and 0.7958, respectively. The SmartConvFall also managed to produce the lowest number of tracking failures with only 43 occasions. Moreover, a three-stack LSTM delivers the lowest mean error with approximately one second delay time in locating the exact instantaneous fall frame. Therefore, the proposed SmartConvFall has demonstrated its potential and suitability to be implemented for a real-time application that could help to avoid any crucial fall consequences such as death and internal bleeding if the early treatment can be administered","[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",'MDPI AG',Optimal Training Configurations of a CNN-LSTM-Based Tracker for a Fall Frame Detection System,10.3390/s21196485,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
427515100,2021-04-01T00:00:00,"An End-Of-Turn Detection Module (EOTD-M) is an essential component of automatic Spoken Dialogue Systems. The capability of correctly detecting whether a user?s utterance has ended or not improves the accuracy in interpreting the meaning of the message and decreases the latency in the answer. Usually, in dialogue systems, an EOTD-M is coupled with an Automatic Speech Recognition Module (ASR-M) to transmit complete utterances to the Natural Language Understanding unit. Mistakes in the ASR-M transcription can have a strong effect on the performance of the EOTD-M. The actual extent of this effect depends on the particular combination of ASR M transcription errors and the sentence featurization techniques implemented as part of the EOTD-M. In this paper we investigate this important relationship for an EOTD-M based on semantic information and particular characteristics of the speakers (speech profiles). We introduce an Automatic Speech Recognition Simulator (ASR-SIM) that models different types of semantic mistakes in the ASR-M transcription as well as different speech profiles. We use the simulator to evaluate the sensitivity to ASR-M mistakes of a Long Short-Term Memory network classifier trained in EOTD with different featurization techniques. Our experiments reveal the different ways in which the performance of the model is influenced by the ASR-M errors. We corroborate that not only is the ASR-SIM useful to estimate the performance of an EOTD-M in customized noisy scenarios, but it can also be used to generate training datasets with the expected error rates of real working conditions, which leads to better performance.The research presented in this paper has been conducted as part of the project EMPATHIC that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 769872.

429962165,2021-05-19T07:58:39,"Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia, but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing. Project organizations and machine learning practitioners face manifold challenges and risks when developing machine learning applications and have a need for guidance to meet business expectations. This paper therefore proposes a process model for the development of machine learning applications, covering six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. Business and data understanding are executed simultaneously in the first phase, as both have considerable impact on the feasibility of the project. The next phases are comprised of data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Special focus is applied to the last phase, as a model running in changing real-time environments requires close monitoring and maintenance to reduce the risk of performance degradation over time. With each task of the process, this work proposes quality assurance methodology that is suitable to address challenges in machine learning development that are identified in the form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature, and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support, but fails to address machine learning specific tasks.

Exploratory qualitative research employed as methods of inquiry. Twelve resource persons were interviewed (3 teachers and 9 parents). The data revealed, parents and teachers perceive that using home visits has a number of benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are as follows: 1) more effective than online; 2) make learning materials easy for children to understand; 3) pique children's interest and excitement for learning; and 4) eliminate the need for parents to assist their children with their tasks. Meanwhile, the downsides include the following: 1) it was inconvenient for parents because they were needed to entertain teachers and other children; 2) some pupils couldn't study because home visits were far away from their homes.; 3) additional media and learning activities preparation; 4) additional time and energy was wasted; and 5) the risk of exposure to COVID-19 was increased. The researchers recommend that additional study be conducted with a larger and more diverse sample size in order to obtain a more complete picture of this issue.

481453091,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"In some applications, such as surveillance and biometrics, image enlargement is required to inspect small details on the image. One of the image enlargement approaches is by using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based super-resolution construction from a single image. The first CNN-based image super-resolution algorithm is the super-resolution CNN (SRCNN) developed in 2014. Since then, many researchers have proposed several versions of CNN-based algorithms for image super-resolution to improve the accuracy or reduce the model&#x2019;s running time. Currently, some algorithms still suffered from the vanishing-gradient problem and relied on a large number of layers. Thus, the motivation of this work is to reduce the vanishing-gradient problem that can improve the accuracy, and at the same time, reduce the running time of the model. In this paper, an enhanced dense space attention network (EDSAN) model is proposed to overcome the problems. The EDSAN model adopted a dense connection and residual network to utilize all the features to correlate the low-level feature and high-level feature as much as possible. Besides, implementing the convolution block attention module (CBAM) layer and multiscale block (MSB) helped reduce the number of layers required to achieve comparable results. The model is evaluated through peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) metrics. EDSAN achieved the most significant improvement, about 1.42&#x0025; when compared to the CRN model using the Set5 dataset at a scale factor of 3. Compared to the ERN model, EDSAN performed the best, with a 1.22&#x0025; improvement made when using the Set5 dataset at a scale factor of 4. In terms of overall performance, EDSAN performed very well in all datasets at a scale factor of 2 and 3. In conclusion, EDSAN successfully solves the problems above, and it can be used in different applications such as biometric identification applications and real-time video applications","[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Enhanced Dense Space Attention Network for Super-Resolution Construction From Single Input Image,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111983,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479627403,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Seed purity directly affects the quality of seed breeding and subsequent processing products. Seed sorting based on machine vision provides an effective solution to this problem. The deep learning technology, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have exhibited impressive performance in image recognition and classification, and have been proven applicable in seed sorting. However the huge computational complexity and massive storage requirements make it a great challenge to deploy them in real-time applications, especially on devices with limited resources. In this study, a rapid and highly efficient lightweight CNN based on visual attention, namely SeedSortNet, is proposed for seed sorting. First, a dual-branch lightweight feature extraction module Shield-block is elaborately designed by performing identity mapping, spatial transformation at higher dimensions and different receptive field modeling, and thus it can alleviate information loss and effectively characterize the multi-scale feature while utilizing fewer parameters and lower computational complexity. In the down-sampling layer, the traditional MaxPool is replaced as MaxBlurPool to improve the shift-invariant of the network. Also, an extremely lightweight sub-feature space attention module (SFSAM) is presented to selectively emphasize fine-grained features and suppress the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that SeedSortNet achieves the accuracy rates of 97.33% and 99.56% on the maize seed dataset and sunflower seed dataset, respectively, and outperforms the mainstream lightweight networks (MobileNetv2, ShuffleNetv2, etc.) at similar computational costs, with only 0.400M parameters (vs. 4.06M, 5.40M)","[{'title': 'PeerJ Computer Science', 'identifiers': ['2376-5992', 'issn:2376-5992']}]",'PeerJ',SeedSortNet: a rapid and highly effificient lightweight CNN based on visual attention for seed sorting,10.7717/peerj-cs.639,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429033224,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.

479182827,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) is one of the technologies that provides high performance with a high density of connected devices to support emerging demanding services, such as virtual and augmented reality. However, in highly dense deployments, Wi-Fi performance is severely affected by interference. This problem is even worse in new standards, such as 802.11n/ac, where new features such as Channel Bonding (CB) are introduced to increase network capacity but at the cost of using wider spectrum channels. Finding the best channel assignment in dense deployments under dynamic environments with CB is challenging, given its combinatorial nature. Therefore, the use of analytical or system models to predict Wi-Fi performance after potential changes (e.g., dynamic channel selection with CB, and the deployment of new devices) are not suitable, due to either low accuracy or high computational cost. This paper presents a novel, data-driven approach to speed up this process, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that exploits the information carried in the deployment’s topology and the intricate wireless interactions to predict Wi-Fi performance with high accuracy. The evaluation results show that preserving the graph structure in the learning process obtains a 64% increase versus a naive approach, and around 55% compared to other Machine Learning (ML) approaches when using all training features","[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",'MDPI AG',ATARI: A Graph Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Performance Prediction in Next-Generation WLANs,10.3390/s21134321,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

344795124,2022-04-01T00:00:00,"Purpose In 2018, an artificial intelligence (AI) interview platform was introduced and adopted by companies in Korea. This study aims to explore the perspectives of applicants who have experienced an AI-based interview through this platform and examines the opinions of companies, a platform developer and academia. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a phenomenological approach. The participants, who had recent experience of AI video interviews, were recruited offline and online. Eighteen job applicants in their 20s, two companies that have adopted this interview platform, a software developer who created the platform and three professors participated in the study. To collect data, focus group interviews and in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings As a result, all of them believed that an AI-based interview was more efficient than a traditional one in terms of cost and time savings and is likely to be adopted by more companies in the future. They pointed to the possibility of data bias requiring an improvement in AI accountability.

483656524,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper demonstrates the implementation and performance testing of a Deep Reinforcement Learning based control scheme used for Dynamic Positioning of a marine surface vessel. The control scheme encapsulated motion control and control allocation by using a neural network, which was trained on a digital twin without having any prior knowledge of the system dynamics, using the Proximal Policy Optimization learning algorithm. By using a multivariate Gaussian reward function for rewarding small errors between the vessel and the various setpoints, while encouraging small actuator outputs, the proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning based control scheme showed good positioning performance while being energy efficient. Both simulations and model scale sea trials were carried out to demonstrate performance compared to traditional methods, and to evaluate the ability of neural networks trained in simulation to perform on real life systems",,'Elsevier BV',Dynamic Positioning using Deep Reinforcement Learning,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395079680,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Since years, the number of seniors increases while, at the same time, we observe a diminution of the potential support ratio. In order to overcome this limitation, solutions emerged, such as smart homes and wearable devices. Smart homes integrate sensors, actuators, and artificial intelligence to assist seniors in their everyday life. One of the objectives is to recognize the activities of everyday life. This recognition aims to provide the right assistance at the right moment and gives some autonomy to seniors. However, it is a complex task (a significant quantity of different sensors, hardware implementation), and the number of solutions (combinations between approaches, for example, video-based HAR and wearable sensors-based HAR) that exist is important. In this paper, we propose to perform the activity recognition from three ultra-wideband (UWB) radars, deep learning models, and a voting system. Also, all the experiments have been conducted in a real apartment and are composed of 15 different activities. The presented solution is simple compared to the literature since we exploit only one type of sensor. Finally, we obtained promising results with our approach. Indeed, the classification rate reaches 90% and more in some cases",,'Elsevier BV',Recognizing activities of daily living from UWB radars and deep learning,10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113994,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Experiments on a public, real-life dataset are led here to evaluate carefully each of the choices that were made, with a specific emphasis on data fusion methods. Our most surprising finding is that none of the methods we implemented from the literature is better than a simple late fusion. Two important decisions are the choice of a sensor and the choice of a representation for the data: we found that using 2D convolutions on spectrograms with a logarithmic axis for the frequencies was better than 1-dimensional temporal representations. To foster the research on deep learning with embedded inertial sensors, we release our code along with our publication",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Data Fusion for Deep Learning on Transport Mode Detection: A Case Study,10.1007/978-3-030-80568-5_12,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
523295486,2022-01-28T00:00:00,"Deep Learning has been successfully applied to image recognition, speech recognition,
and natural language processing in recent years. Therefore, there has been an incentive to apply
it in other fields as well. The field of agriculture is one of the most important fields in which the
application of deep learning still needs to be explored, as it has a direct impact on human well-being.
In particular, there is a need to explore how deep learning models can be used as a tool for optimal
planting, land use, yield improvement, production/disease/pest control, and other activities. The
vast amount of data received from sensors in smart farms makes it possible to use deep learning as a
model for decision-making in this field. In agriculture, no two environments are exactly alike, which
makes testing, validating, and successfully implementing such technologies much more complex
than in most other industries. This paper reviews some recent scientific developments in the field of
deep learning that have been applied to agriculture, and highlights some challenges and potential
solutions using deep learning algorithms in agriculture. The results in this paper indicate that by
employing new methods from deep learning, higher performance in terms of accuracy and lower
inference time can be achieved, and the models can be made useful in real-world applications. Finally,
some opportunities for future research in this area are suggested.This work is supported by the R&D Project BioDAgro—Sistema operacional inteligente de

478033462,2022-02-01T00:00:00,"Nowadays, the number of road accident in Malaysia is increasing expeditiously. One of the ways to reduce the number of road accident is through the development of the advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) by professional engineers. Several ADAS system has been proposed by taking into consideration the delay tolerance and the accuracy of the system itself. In this work, a traffic sign recognition system has been developed to increase the safety of the road users by installing the system inside the car for driver’s awareness. TensorFlow algorithm has been considered in this work for object recognition through machine learning due to its high accuracy. The algorithm is embedded in the Raspberry Pi 3 for processing and analysis to detect the traffic sign from the real-time video recording from Raspberry Pi camera NoIR. This work aims to study the accuracy, delay and reliability of the developed system using a Raspberry Pi 3 processor considering several scenarios related to the state of the environment and the condition of the traffic signs. A real-time testbed implementation has been conducted considering twenty different traffic signs and the results show that the system has more than 90% accuracy and is reliable with an acceptable delay",,'Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science',Real-time traffic sign detection and recognition using Raspberry Pi,10.11591/ijece.v12i1.pp331-338,https://core.ac.uk/download/478033462.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
493124459,2022-01-31T00:00:00,"[EN] The concept of Servitization has been constantly developing since its outset, but in the last decade due to the irruption of Industry 4.0, the complexity of the concept and its typologies of value propositions have evolved considerably, opening up endless opportunities. In this sense, the main objective of this research is to show a summary review of the evolution of Servitization since its beginnings and the new typologies that are emerging due to the digitalization that arises through Industry 4.0. For this purpose, a systematic review of the leading databases in the field of services has been conducted. The results of the literature review show the potential of Servitization and the need to understand each reality in order to adapt to new capabilities that help the companies who become service-oriented benefit from major advantages. Ultimately, it can be concluded that, in the short term, Industry 4.0 and its new business models are the key, however, Servitization will continue to evolve to a point where all organizations will need to adapt to new trends.Ruiz De La Torre, A.; Sanchez, D.

479314553,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"One of the biggest challenges hindering a table tennis robot to play as well as a professional player is the ball&#x2019;s accurate motion control, which depends on various factors such as the incoming ball&#x2019;s position, linear, spin velocity and so forth. Unfortunately, some factors are almost impossible to be directly measured in real practice, such as the ball&#x2019;s spin velocity, which is difficult to be estimated from vision due to the little texture on the ball&#x2019;s surface. To perform accurate motion control in table tennis, this study proposes to learn a ball stroke strategy to guarantee desirable &#x201C;target landing location&#x201D; and the &#x201C;over-net height&#x201D; which are two key indicators to evaluate the quality of a stroke. To overcome the spin velocity challenge, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based stroke approach is developed with the spin velocity estimation capability, through which the system can predict the relative spin velocity of the ball and stroke it back accurately by iteratively learning from the robot-environment interactions. To pre-train the DRL-based strategy effectively, this paper develops a virtual table tennis playing environment, through which various simulated data can be collected. For the real table tennis robot implementation, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control strategy compared to that of the traditional aerodynamics-based method with an average landing error around 80mm and the landing-within-table probability higher than 70&#x0025;","[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Ball Motion Control in the Table Tennis Robot System Using Time-Series Deep Reinforcement Learning,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093340,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

430688355,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background and objectiveDynamic muscle fascicle length measurements through B-mode ultrasound have become popular for the non-invasive physiological insights they provide regarding musculoskeletal structure-function. However, current practices typically require time consuming post-processing to track muscle length changes from B-mode images. A real-time measurement tool would not only save processing time but would also help pave the way toward closed-loop applications based on feedback signals driven by in vivo muscle length change patterns. In this paper, we benchmark an approach that combines traditional machine learning (ML) models with B-mode ultrasound recordings to obtain muscle fascicle length changes in real-time. To gauge the utility of this framework for 'in-the-loop' applications, we evaluate accuracy of the extracted muscle length change signals against time-series' derived from a standard, post-hoc automated tracking algorithm.MethodsWe collected B-mode ultrasound data from the soleus muscle of six participants performing five defined ankle motion tasks: (a) seated, constrained ankle plantarflexion, (b) seated, free ankle dorsi/plantarflexion, (c) weight-bearing, calf raises (d) walking, and then a (e) mix. We trained machine learning (ML) models by pairing muscle fascicle lengths obtained from standardized automated tracking software (UltraTrack) with the respective B-mode ultrasound image input to the tracker, frame-by-frame. Then we conducted hyperparameter optimizations for five different ML models using a grid search to find the best performing parameters for a combination of high correlation and low RMSE between ML and UltraTrack processed muscle fascicle length trajectories. Finally, using the global best model/hyperparameter settings, we comprehensively evaluated training-testing outcomes within subject (i.e., train and test on same subject), cross subject (i.e., train on one subject, test on another) and within/direct cross task (i.e., train and test on same subject, but different task).ResultsSupport vector machine (SVM) was the best performing model with an average r = 0.70 ±0.34 and average RMSE = 2.86 ±2.55 mm across all direct training conditions and average r = 0.65 ±0.35 and average RMSE = 3.28 ±2.64 mm when optimized for all cross-participant conditions. Comparisons between ML vs. UltraTrack (i.e., ground truth) tracked muscle fascicle length versus time data indicated that ML tracked images reliably capture the salient qualitative features in ground truth length change data, even when correlation values are on the lower end. Furthermore, in the direct training, calf raises condition, which is most comparable to previous studies validating automated tracking performance during isolated contractions on a dynamometer, our ML approach yielded 0.90 average correlation, in line with other accepted tracking methods in the field.ConclusionsBy combining B-mode ultrasound and classical ML models, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve real-time tracking of human soleus muscle fascicles across a number of functionally relevant contractile conditions. This novel sensing modality paves the way for muscle physiology in-the-loop applications that could be used to modify gait via biofeedback or unlock novel wearable device control techniques that could enable restored or augmented locomotion performance","[{'title': 'PLoS ONE', 'identifiers': ['issn:1932-6203', '1932-6203']}]",'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',Machine learning to extract muscle fascicle length changes from dynamic ultrasound images in real-time.,10.1371/journal.pone.0246611,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479360462,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Introduction. An important part of an automotive unmanned vehicle (UV) control system is the environment analysis module. This module is based on various types of sensors, e.g. video cameras, lidars and radars. The development of computer and video technologies makes it possible to implement an environment analysis module using a single video camera as a sensor. This approach is expected to reduce the cost of the entire module. The main task in video image processing is to analyse the environment as a 3D scene. The 3D trajectory of an object, which takes into account its dimensions, angle of view and movement vector, as well as the vehicle pose in a video image, provides sufficient information for assessing the real interaction of objects. A basis for constructing a 3D trajectory is vehicle pose estimation.Aim. To develop an automatic method for estimating vehicle pose based on video data analysis from a single video camera.Materials and methods. An automatic method for vehicle pose estimation from a video image was proposed based on a cascade approach. The method includes vehicle detection, key points determination, segmentation and vehicle pose estimation. Vehicle detection and determination of its key points were resolved via a neural network. The segmentation of a vehicle video image and its mask preparation were implemented by transforming it into a polar coordinate system and searching for the outer contour using graph theory.Results. The estimation of vehicle pose was implemented by matching the Fourier image of vehicle mask signatures and the templates obtained based on 3D models. The correctness of the obtained vehicle pose and angle of view estimation was confirmed by experiments based on the proposed method. The vehicle pose estimation had an accuracy of 89 % on an open Carvana image dataset.Conclusion. A new approach for vehicle pose estimation was proposed, involving the transition from end-to-end learning of neural networks to resolve several problems at once, e.g., localization, classification, segmentation, and angle of view, towards cascade analysis of information. The accuracy level of end-to-end learning requires large sets of representative data, which complicates the scalability of solutions for road environments in Russia. The proposed method makes it possible to estimate the vehicle pose with a high accuracy level, at the same time as involving no large costs for manual data annotation and training","[{'title': 'Journal of the Russian Universities Radioelectronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:1993-8985', '1993-8985', 'issn:2658-4794', '2658-4794']}]",'St. Petersburg Electrotechnical University LETI',Method for Automatic Determination of a 3D Trajectory of Vehicles in a Video Image,10.32603/1993-8985-2021-24-3-49-59,https://core.ac.uk/download/479360462.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

ECG-segmented cine images (n = 503) generated from both complex k-space data and magnitude-only DICOM were used to synthetize radial real-time cine MRI. Complex-Valued-Net and Magnitude-Net were trained with fully sampled and synthetized radial real-time cine pairs generated from highly undersampled (12-fold) complex k-space and DICOM images, respectively. Real-time cine was prospectively acquired in 29 patients with 12-fold accelerated free-breathing tiny golden-angle radial sequence and reconstructed with both Complex-Valued-Net and Magnitude-Net. Cardiac function, left-ventricular (LV) structure, and subjective image quality [1(non-diagnostic)-5(excellent)] were calculated from Complex-Valued-Net– and Magnitude-Net–reconstructed real-time cine datasets and compared to those of ECG-segmented cine (reference).Results: Free-breathing real-time cine reconstructed by both networks had high correlation (all R2 &gt; 0.7) and good agreement (all p &gt; 0.05) with standard clinical ECG-segmented cine with respect to LV function and structural parameters. Real-time cine reconstructed by Complex-Valued-Net had superior image quality compared to images from Magnitude-Net in terms of myocardial edge sharpness (Complex-Valued-Net = 3.5 ± 0.5; Magnitude-Net = 2.6 ± 0.5), temporal fidelity (Complex-Valued-Net = 3.1 ± 0.4; Magnitude-Net = 2.1 ± 0.4), and artifact suppression (Complex-Valued-Net = 3.1 ± 0.5; Magnitude-Net = 2.0 ± 0.0), which were all inferior to those of ECG-segmented cine (4.1 ± 1.4, 3.9 ± 1.0, and 4.0 ± 1.1).Conclusion: Compared to Magnitude-Net, Complex-Valued-Net produced improved subjective image quality for reconstructed real-time cine images and did not show any difference in quantitative measures of LV function and structure","[{'title': 'Frontiers in Physics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2296-424X', '2296-424x']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',Comparison of Complex k-Space Data and Magnitude-Only for Training of Deep Learning–Based Artifact Suppression for Real-Time Cine MRI,10.3389/fphy.2021.684184,https://core.ac.uk/download/481197080.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
441013370,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"In order to improve the weeding efficiency and protect farm crops, accurate and fast weeds removal guidance to agricultural mobile robots is an utmost important topic. Based on this motivation, we propose a time-efficient quadratic traversal algorithm for the removal guidance of weeds around the recognized corn in the field. To recognize the weeds and corns, a Faster R-CNN neural network is implemented in real-time recognition. Then, an ultra-green characterization (EXG) hyperparameter is used for grayscale image processing. An improved OTSU (IOTSU) algorithm is proposed to accurately generate and optimize the binary image. Compared to the traditional OTSU algorithm, the improved OTSU algorithm effectively shortens the search speed of the algorithm and reduces the calculation processing time by compressing the range of the search grayscale range. Finally, based on the contour of the target plants and the Canny edge detection operator, the shortest weeding path guidance can be calculated by the proposed quadratic traversal algorithm. The experimental results proved that our search success rate can reach 90.0% on the testing date. This result ensured the accurate selection of the target 2D coordinates in the pixel coordinate system.

480278110,2021-12-01T00:00:00,"Among the wide variety of malicious behavior commonly observed in modern social platforms, one of the most notorious is the diffusion of fake news, given its potential to influence the opinions of millions of people who can be voters, consumers, or simply citizens going about their daily lives. In this paper, we implement and carry out an empirical evaluation of a version of the recently-proposed NetDER architecture for hybrid AI decision-support systems with the capability of leveraging the availability of machine learning modules, logical reasoning about unknown objects, and forecasts based on diffusion processes. NetDER is a general architecture for reasoning about different kinds of malicious behavior such as dissemination of fake news, hate speech, and malware, detection of botnet operations, prevention of cyber attacks including those targeting software products or blockchain transactions, among others. Here, we focus on the case of fake news dissemination on social platforms by three different kinds of users: non-malicious, malicious, and botnet members. In particular, we focus on three tasks: (i) determining who is responsible for posting a fake news article, (ii) detecting malicious users, and (iii) detecting which users belong to a botnet designed to disseminate fake news. Given the difficulty of obtaining adequate data with ground truth, we also develop a testbed that combines real-world fake news datasets with synthetically generated networks of users and fully-detailed traces of their behavior throughout a series of time points. We designed our testbed to be customizable for different problem sizes and settings, and make its code publicly available to be used in similar evaluation efforts. Finally, we report on the results of a thorough experimental evaluation of three variants of our model and six environmental settings over the three tasks. Our results clearly show the effects that the quality of knowledge engineering tasks, the quality of the underlying machine learning classifier used to detect fake news, and the specific environmental conditions have on smart policing efforts in social platforms.Fil: Paredes, José Nicolás.

334959107,2021-04-01T00:00:00,"The random subspace method, also known as the pillar of random forests, is good at making precise and robust predictions. However, there is as yet no straightforward way to combine it with deep learning. In this paper, we therefore propose Neural Random Subspace (NRS), a novel deep learning based random subspace method. In contrast to previous forest methods, NRS enjoys the benefits of end-to-end, data-driven representation learning, as well as pervasive support from deep learning software and hardware platforms, hence achieving faster inference speed and higher accuracy. Furthermore, as a non-linear component to be encoded into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), NRS learns non-linear feature representations in CNNs more efficiently than contemporary, higher-order pooling methods, producing excellent results with negligible increase in parameters, floating point operations (FLOPs) and real running time. Compared with random subspaces, random forests and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs), NRS demonstrates superior performance on 35 machine learning datasets. Moreover, on both 2D image and 3D point cloud recognition tasks, integration of NRS with CNN architectures achieves consistent improvements with only incremental cost",,,Neural random subspace,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The embedded multifunctional perception system is urged for better interaction and user experience. To realize such a system, a smart soft robotic manipulator is presented that consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator tactile (T‐TENG) and length (L‐TENG) sensor, as well as a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) pyroelectric temperature sensor. With the aid of machine learning (ML) for data processing, the fusion of the T‐TENG and L‐TENG sensors can realize the automatic recognition of the grasped objects with the accuracy of 97.143% for 28 different shapes of objects, while the temperature distribution can also be obtained through the pyroelectric sensor. By leveraging the IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics, a digital‐twin‐based virtual shop is successfully implemented to provide the users with real‐time feedback about the details of the product. In general, by offering a more immersive experience in human–machine interactions, the proposed remote interactive system shows the great potential of being the advanced human–machine interface for the applications of the unmanned working space","[{'title': 'Advanced Science', 'identifiers': ['2198-3844', 'issn:2198-3844']}]",'Wiley',Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) Enabled Virtual Shop Applications Using Self‐Powered Sensor Enhanced Soft Robotic Manipulator,10.1002/advs.202100230,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

De fet, a principis del segle XXI, la legislació espanyola ha respost ràpidament als reptes plantejats pels avanços de la biotecnologia i la genòmica en el camp de la recerca biomèdica mitjançant la promulgació en 2007 de la Llei de Recerca Biomèdica per a mantenir-se al dia amb el canvi de paradigma. Durant els últims 10 anys, aquest marc espanyol juntament amb el Reial decret 1716/2011 ha tingut el mèrit d'abordar les qüestions ètiques més controvertides relacionades amb els biobancs. No obstant això, avui la regulació de la recerca biomèdica i els biobancs ha de bregar amb la intel·ligència artificial i recerques amb gran quantitat de dades que han plantejat una sèrie de desafiaments i controvèrsies. L'objectiu d'aquest article és doble. En primer lloc, analitzaré des d'un punt de vista ètic els mèrits de la regulació espanyola sobre biobancs amb la finalitat d'extreure algunes lliçons de la situació encara no regulada en altres Estats membres.En segon lloc, tractaré el canvi de paradigma en la recerca biomèdica i em preguntaré si el marc ètic i legal que va introduir la llei espanyola a principis de segle encara és capaç de mantenir-se ferm davant els nous desafiaments contextuals i socials. En aquest sentit, identificaré algunes oportunitats d'implementació i suggeriré estratègies per a aconseguir-les en el context específic dels biobancs.In the European landscape, Spain represents a positive reference point when it comes to biobank regulation. Indeed, at the beginning of XXI century, the Spanish legislation has promptly responded to challenges posed by new biotechnologies and advances in genomics in the field of biomedical research by enacting in 2007 the Ley de Investigación Biomédica in order to keep up with the paradigm shift. Over the past 10 years, this Spanish framework along with the Real Decreto 1716/2011 has hold the merit to tackle the most controversial ethical issues related to use of human samples and personal data in biomedical research and biobanking (e.g. broad consent, secondary uses, governance, etc.). However, today the regulation of biomedical research and biobanks has to deal with big data, artificial intelligence and data-intensive research which have brought a number of challenges and controversies. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, I will analyse from an ethical point of view the merits of Spanish regulation on biobanking in order to draw some lessons for the still unregulated situation in other Member States. Secondly, I will discuss the big data paradigm shift in biomedical research and question if the ethical and legal framework introduced the Spanish law at the beginning of the century is still able to hold the ground with the new contextual and societal challenges. In this respect, I will identify some opportunities for implementation and suggest strategies to achieve them in the specific context of biobanks.En el panorama europeo, España representa un punto de referencia positivo en lo que respecta a la regulación de los biobancos.

523270368,2021-08-30T18:11:30,"none3noNowadays, the volume of the multimedia heterogeneous evidence presented for digital forensic analysis has significantly increased, thus requiring the application of big data technologies, cloud-based forensics services, as well as Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In digital forensics domain, ML algorithms have been applied for cybercrime investigation such as child abuse investigations, malware classification, and image forensics. This paper addresses this issues and deals with forensic analysis of digital images and videos. In particular, this work aims at proposing a multimedia classification tool with a parallel software architecture for a fast inspection, which is easy to use (to be used by officers during a search), requires limited hardware resources and it is built on an open-source software to limit its costs. Moreover, this tool must be able to quickly inspect multiple devices at a time. When positives are found in a device, such device will be seized for a deeper analysis later in the lab. It will not be seized otherwise, reducing the inconvenience for the suspect as well as the time required for the next analysis phase. As a case study, we focus on the identification of child pornography images. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is capable of guaranteeing a high recall, a fast process and high performances in real scenarios.noneSpalazzi L.; Paolanti M.; Frontoni E.Spalazzi, L.; Paolanti, M.; Frontoni, E",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An offline parallel architecture for forensic multimedia classification,10.1007/s11042-021-10819-x,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

For this purpose, Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) is nowadays an active area of research. In this article, a CBVR system providing similar videos from a large multimedia dataset based on query video has been proposed. This approach uses vector motion-based signatures to describe the visual content and uses machine learning techniques to extract key frames for rapid browsing and efficient video indexing. The proposed method has been implemented on both single machine and real-time distributed cluster to evaluate the real-time performance aspect, especially when the number and size of videos are large.

475699877,2021-07-28T13:29:26,"Efficient video processing is a critical component in many IoMT applications to detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources, such as CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally intensive deep neural network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at high-end (or cloud) nodes. This article presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage allied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud paradigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the query and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching. VID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video inference process across nodes. This article proposes a novel content-driven microbatch resizing , query-aware caching, and microbatch-based utility filtering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to improve the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive evaluations are performed over five real-world data sets. The experimental results show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves &#8764;2.3× higher throughput with minimal latency and ~99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines while maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',VID-WIN: Fast video event matching with query-aware windowing at the edge for the internet of multimedia things,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

429990396,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system. Its diagnosis nowadays commonly includes performing an MRI scan, as it is the most sensitive imaging test for MS. MS plaques are commonly identified from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images as hyperintense regions that are highly varying in terms of their shapes, sizes and locations, and are routinely classified in accordance to the McDonald criteria. Recent years have seen an increase in works that aimed at development of various semi-automatic and automatic methods for detection, segmentation and classification of MS plaques. In this paper, we present an automatic combined method, based on two pipelines: a traditional unsupervised machine learning technique and a deep-learning attention-gate 3D U-net network. The deep-learning network is specifically trained to address the weaker points of the traditional approach, namely difficulties in segmenting infratentorial and juxtacortical plaques in real-world clinical MRIs. It was trained and validated on a multi-center multi-scanner dataset that contains 159 cases, each with T1 weighted (T1w) and FLAIR images, as well as manual delineations of the MS plaques, segmented and validated by a panel of raters. The detection rate was quantified using lesion-wise Dice score. A simple label fusion is implemented to combine the output segmentations of the two pipelines. This combined method improves the detection of infratentorial and juxtacortical lesions by 14% and 31% respectively, in comparison to the unsupervised machine learning pipeline that was used as a performance assessment baseline","[{'title': 'NeuroImage Clinical', 'identifiers': ['2213-1582', 'issn:2213-1582']}]",'Elsevier BV',icobrain ms 5.1: Combining unsupervised and supervised approaches for improving the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions,10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102707,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Commercial vehicles that pass a CVSA inspection are eligible for a decal representing a commitment to safety. In this work, we propose a two‐step automatic CVSA decal recognition system using deep convolutional neural network architectures. The first step localizes a vehicle's windshield and the CVSA decal within, and classifies the decal colour. The CVSA decal is cropped and used as input to the second stage, which localizes and classifies a digit and the corner‐cut of a CVSA decal. With the corner cut, colour, and digit, the system can determine the decal's date of issue. We use as our baseline the MobileDet architecture, customizing the backbone to our tasks. Our first custom architecture is larger than the baseline because it needs more representational power to detect small decals within an image. The second architecture is much smaller because digit and corner‐cut recognition is a simpler task. Our custom architectures reduce processing time and exceed accuracies relative to pre‐trained architectures. We implemented our models on different edge hardware accelerators (e.g. the Google Coral, Nvidia Jetsons, and Intel NCS) and compared the performance when processing a real‐time video stream.

It affects the patient in life’s major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, and the usual treatment is performed with the help of anti-psychotic medication, which targets primarily the hallucinations, delirium, etc. Other symptoms, such as the decreased emotional expression or avolition, require a multidisciplinary approach, including psychopharmacology, cognitive training, and many forms of therapy. In this context, this paper addresses the use of digital technologies to design and develop innovative rehabilitation techniques, particularly focusing on mental health rehabilitation, and contributing for the promotion of well-being and health from a holistic perspective. In this context, serious games and virtual reality allows for creation of immersive environments that contribute to a more effective and lasting recovery, with improvements in terms of quality of life. The use of machine learning techniques will allow the real-time analysis of the data collected during the execution of the rehabilitation procedures, as well as enable their dynamic and automatic adaptation according to the profile and performance of the patients, by increasing or reducing the exercises’ difficulty. It relies on the acquisition of biometric and physiological signals, such as voice, heart rate, and game performance, to estimate the stress level, thus adapting the difficulty of the experience to the skills of the patient.

However, most of the existing platforms to interface algorithms with 3D environments are often designed to setup navigation-related experiments, to study physical interactions, or to handle ad-hoc cases that are not thought to be customized, sometimes lacking a strong photorealistic appearance and an easy-to-use software interface. In this paper, we present a novel platform, SAILenv, that is specifically designed to be simple and customizable, and that allows researchers to experiment visual recognition in virtual 3D scenes. A few lines of code are needed to interface every algorithm with the virtual world, and non-3D-graphics experts can easily customize the 3D environment itself, exploiting a collection of photorealistic objects. Our framework yields pixel-level semantic and instance labeling, depth, and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only one that provides motion-related information directly inherited from the 3D engine. The client-server communication operates at a low level, avoiding the overhead of HTTP-based data exchanges. We perform experiments using a state-of-the-art object detector trained on real-world images, showing that it is able to recognize the photorealistic 3D objects of our environment.

Dozens of free and open cores developed based on this instruction set architecture have been released, and RISC-V based devices optimized for specific applications such as the IoT and wearables, embedded systems, AI, and virtual, augmented reality are emerging. As the RISC-V cores are being used in various fields, the demand for multicore platforms composed of RISC-V cores is also rapidly increasing. Although there are various RISC-V cores developed for each specific application, and it seems possible to pick them up to create the most optimized multicore for the target application, unfortunately it is very difficult to realize this in reality. This is mainly because most open cores are released in the form of a single core without cache coherence logic, which requires expensive design effort and development costs to address it. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a method to solve the cache coherence problem without additional effort from the developer and to maximize the performance of the multicore composed of the RISC-V core selected by the developer. Along with a description of the sophisticated operating mechanisms of the proposed method, this paper details the architecture and hardware implementation of the proposed method.

Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions. One reason may be fragility in treating properly unexpected or perturbed data. The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations. A systematic approach is proposed for artificially injecting perturbations in the data and for evaluating the robustness of the models. This approach focuses on two perturbations that are likely to happen during data collection. Our experimental study, conducted on twenty sensors’ datasets from the public University of California Riverside (UCR) repository, shows a great disparity of the models’ robustness under data quality degradation. Those results are used to analyse whether the impact of such robustness can be predictable—thanks to decision trees—which would prevent us from testing all perturbations scenarios.

This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios.

523414551,2022-02-24T12:24:22,"none4noReal‐time business practices require huge amounts of data directly from the production assets. This new thirst for accurate and timely data has forced the convergence of the traditionally business‐focused information technology (IT) environment with the production‐focused operational technology (OT). Recently, software‐defined network (SDN) methodologies have benefitted OT networks with enhanced situational awareness, centralized configuration, deny‐by-default forwarding rules, and increased performance. What makes SDNs so innovative is the separation between the control plane and the data plane, centralizing the command in the controllers. However, due to their young age, the use of SDNs in the industry context has not yet matured comprehensive SDN‐based architectures for IT/OT networks, which are also resistant to security attacks such as denial‐of‐service ones, which may occur in SDN‐based industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. One main motivation is that the lack of comprehensive SDN‐based architectures for IT/OT networks making it difficult to effectively simulate, analyze, and identify proper detection and mitigation strategies for DoS attacks in IT/OT networks. No consolidated security solutions are available that provide DoS detection and mitigation strategies in IT/OT networks. Along this direction, this paper’s contributions are twofold. On the one hand, this paper proposes a convergent IT/OT SDN‐based architecture applied in a real implementation of an IT/OT support infrastructure called SIRDAM4.0 within the context of the SBDIOI40 project. On the other hand, this paper proposes a qualitative analysis on how this architecture works under DoS attacks, focusing on what the specific problems and vulnerabilities are. In particular, we simulated several distributed denial-of‐service (DDoS) attack scenarios within the context of the proposed architecture to show the minimum effort needed by the attacker to hack the network, and our obtained experimental results show how it is possible to compromise the network, thus considerably worsening the performance and, in general, the functioning of the network. Finally, we conclude our analysis with a brief description on the importance of employing machine learning approaches for attack detection and for mitigation techniques.openFoschini L.; Mignardi V.; Montanari R.; Scotece D.Foschini L.; Mignardi V.; Montanari R.; Scotece D",,'MDPI AG',An sdn‐enabled architecture for it/ot converged networks: A proposal and qualitative analysis under ddos attacks,10.3390/fi13100258,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the reconstruction of such tools starting from 3D architectural surveying is still largely deemed as a lengthy and time-consuming process, with inherent complexities related to managing and interpreting unstructured and unorganized data derived, e.g., from laser scanning or photogrammetry. Tackling this issue and starting from reality-based surveying, the purpose of this paper is to semi-automatically reconstruct parametric representations for H-BIM-related uses, by means of the most recent 3D data classification techniques that exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI). The presented methodology consists of a first semantic segmentation phase, aiming at the automatic recognition through AI of architectural elements of historic buildings within points clouds; a Random Forest classifier is used for the classification task, evaluating each time the performance of the predictive model. At a second stage, visual programming techniques are applied to the reconstruction of a conceptual mock-up of each detected element and to the subsequent propagation of the 3D information to other objects with similar characteristics. The resulting parametric model can be used for heritage preservation and dissemination purposes, as common practices implemented in modern H-BIM documentation systems. The methodology is tailored to representative case studies related to the typology of the medieval cloister and scattered over the Tuscan territory","[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['2194-9034', 'issn:2194-9034', '1682-1750', 'issn:1682-1750']}]",'Copernicus GmbH',CONNECTING GEOMETRY AND SEMANTICS VIA ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: FROM 3D CLASSIFICATION OF HERITAGE DATA TO H-BIM REPRESENTATIONS,10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIII-B2-2021-145-2021,https://core.ac.uk/download/474903340.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They are also integrated with the internet of things (IoT) to achieve network design, in terms of scalability and heterogeneous services for multimedia applications. Many proposed solutions are performing a vital role in the development of robust protocols and reducing the response time for critical networks. However, most of them are not able to support the forwarding processes of high multimedia traffic under dynamic characteristics with constraint bandwidth. Moreover, they increase the rate of data loss in an uncertain environment and compromise network performance by increasing delivery delay. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization model with mobile edges for multimedia sensors using artificial intelligence of things, which aims to maintain the process of real-time data collection with low consumption of resources. Moreover, it improves the unpredictability of network communication with the integration of software-defined networks (SDN) and mobile edges. Firstly, it utilizes the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), forming the multi-hop network and guaranteed the primary services for constraints network with stable resources management. Secondly, the SDN performs direct association with mobile edges to support the load balancing for multimedia sensors and centralized the management. Finally, multimedia traffic is heading towards applications in an unchanged form and without negotiating using the sharing of subkeys. The experimental results demonstrated its effectiveness for delivery rate by an average of 35%, processing delay by an average of 29%, network overheads by an average of 41%, packet drop ratio by an average of 39%, and packet retransmission by an average of 34% against existing solutions","[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",'MDPI AG',An Optimization Model with Network Edges for Multimedia Sensors Using Artificial Intelligence of Things,10.3390/s21217103,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Ransomware, the dissemination of fake news, and digital kidnapping-related crimes are the most recurrent, in which tampered multimedia content has been the primordial disseminating vehicle. Digital forensic analysis tools are being widely used by criminal investigations to automate the identification of digital evidence in seized electronic equipment. The number of files to be processed and the complexity of the crimes under analysis have highlighted the need to employ efficient digital forensics techniques grounded on state-of-the-art technologies. Machine Learning (ML) researchers have been challenged to apply techniques and methods to improve the automatic detection of manipulated multimedia content. However, the implementation of such methods have not yet been massively incorporated into digital forensic tools, mostly due to the lack of realistic and well-structured datasets of photos and videos. The diversity and richness of the datasets are crucial to benchmark the ML models and to evaluate their appropriateness to be applied in real-world digital forensics applications. An example is the development of third-party modules for the widely used Autopsy digital forensic application. This paper presents a dataset obtained by extracting a set of simple features from genuine and manipulated photos and videos, which are part of state-of-the-art existing datasets. The resulting dataset is balanced, and each entry comprises a label and a vector of numeric values corresponding to the features extracted through a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The dataset is available in a GitHub repository, and the total amount of photos and video frames is 40,588 and 12,400, respectively. The dataset was validated and benchmarked with deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods; however, a plethora of other existing ones can be applied. Generically, the results show a better F1-score for CNN when comparing with SVM, both for photos and videos processing. CNN achieved an F1-score of 0.9968 and 0.8415 for photos and videos, respectively. Regarding SVM, the results obtained with 5-fold cross-validation are 0.9953 and 0.7955, respectively, for photos and videos processing. A set of methods written in Python is available for the researchers, namely to preprocess and extract the features from the original photos and videos files and to build the training and testing sets. Additional methods are also available to convert the original PKL files into CSV and TXT, which gives more flexibility for the ML researchers to use the dataset on existing ML frameworks and tools","[{'title': 'Data', 'identifiers': ['2306-5729', 'issn:2306-5729']}]",'MDPI AG',A Dataset of Photos and Videos for Digital Forensics Analysis Using Machine Learning Processing,10.3390/data6080087,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
511382804,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website.

On this basis, an improved ESPNet model is proposed based on ESPNet. Firstly, the network structure of the ESPNet model is optimized, and then, the model is optimized by using a small amount of weakly labeled and unlabeled scene sample data.

By the time of this article, most states have mandated face masking in public space. Therefore, real-time face mask detection becomes an essential application to prevent the spread of the pandemic. This study will present a face mask detection system that can detect and monitor mask-wearing from camera feeds and alert when there is a violation. The face mask detection algorithm uses a haar cascade classifier to find facial features from the camera feed and then utilizes it to detect the mask-wearing status. With the increasing number of cases all over the world, a system to replace humans to check masks on the faces of people is greatly needed. This system satisfies that need. This system can be employed in public places like transport stations and malls. It will be of great help in companies and huge establishments where there will be a lot of workers.   Alongside this, we have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output the presence or absence of a face mask in an image or a video stream. Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data with 100 percent and 99 percent precision and recall, respectively. We are making a savvy framework that will identify whether the specific user has worn the mask or not and further tell the accuracy level of the detection. Our framework will be python and AI-based which will be safe and quick for implementation.  This system will be of great help there because it is easy to obtain and store the data of the employees working in that Company and will very easily find the people who are not wearing the mask and a will be  sent to that respective person to take Precautions not wearing a mask.

480336524,2021-12-01T00:00:00,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an important part of Affective Computing and emotionally aware Human–Computer Interaction. Emotional expression may vary depending on the language, culture, and the speaker’s personality and vocal attributes. Speaker-adaptive systems can address this issue. In real-world applications, it is not feasible to obtain big datasets for deep learning model training from a specific speaker. This paper proposes a transfer learning approach for personalized SER based on convolutional neural networks. A CNN is trained in a multi-user dataset for generalization and then is fine-tuned for a small speaker-specific dataset. A VGGish model, pre-trained a large-scale dataset for audio event recognition is also evaluated for the task. This comparison highlights the significance of network capacity, dataset length, and domain-relativity for transfer learning. To enhance the applicability of this approach in real-world conditions, a web crowdsourcing application is implemented. An online platform is provided where contributors can follow a standard procedure to record and submit annotated utterances of emotional speech. The recordings are validated and added to the publicly available AESDD dataset of emotional speech. The platform can be used for the creation of personalized emotional speech datasets for speaker-adaptive SER, following the transfer learning strategies that have been evaluated","[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:2666-8270', '2666-8270']}]",'Elsevier BV',A web crowdsourcing framework for transfer learning and personalized Speech Emotion Recognition,10.1016/j.mlwa.2021.100132,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Much effort has been paid to fully understand the relationship between mesoscopic network structure and macroscopic mechanical properties of hydrogels. In this paper, we develop a deep learning approach to predict the mechanical properties of hydrogels from polymer network structures. First, network structural models of hydrogels are constructed from mesoscopic scale using self-avoiding walk method. The constructed model is similar to the real hydrogel network. Then, two deep learning models are proposed to capture the nonlinear mapping from mesoscopic hydrogel network structural model to its macroscale mechanical property. A deep neural network and a 3D convolutional neural network containing the physical information of the network structural model are implemented to predict the nominal stress–stretch curves of hydrogels under uniaxial tension. Our results show that the end-to-end deep learning framework can effectively predict the nominal stress–stretch curves of hydrogel within a wide range of mesoscopic network structures, which demonstrates that the deep learning models are able to capture the internal relationship between complex network structures and mechanical properties. We hope this approach can provide guidance to structural design and material property design of different soft materials","[{'title': 'Mathematics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2227-7390', '2227-7390']}]",'MDPI AG',Deep Learning Approach to Mechanical Property Prediction of Single-Network Hydrogel,10.3390/math9212804,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480151527,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"The article has dealt with the current trends of communication aspects of company’s relations

with the customers. The emphasis is placed on the necessity to review the companies’ marketing

strategies, in particular, due to communication constraints and the corresponding changes in the format

of both direct and feedback with the customers. Restrictive measures have changed the format of

competition, having created the conditions for its concentration in cyberspace. Changes in the nature

of interpersonal communication predetermined by the limited personal activity and the introduction

of remote forms of interaction, have generated demand for innovative ways of communication with

customers. Other factors that require the adjustment of marketing strategies include the emergence

of new behavioral capabilities of consumers associated with the intensive development of digital

communication channels.

It has been noted that in the digital communication environment, digital platforms provide the main

format of communication with the existing customer base and potential customers. In addition, prompt

acquisition and processing of data on purchasing behavior of customers allows companies to increase

significantly the “sensitivity” of marketing research and optimize their own marketing decisions. Among

the areas of increasing targeting and personalization of product offerings, the use of elements of artificial

intelligence and voice search has been accentuated. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence greatly

facilitates and simplifies the work of marketers on the processing and initial analysis of the growing flow

of digital marketing data, as well as provides greater efficiency. It has been concluded that widespread use

of voice assistants in e-commerce requires companies to rethink radically their approaches to internal data

processing, IT investment and customer engagement strategies.

Active integration of chatbots into various communication platforms is able to make them

universal tools for both business and consumers, which will allow them to become a familiar part of

the user experience. Implementation of virtual reality and augmented reality elements in the interface

of company websites can significantly diversify the process of collecting information by users and push

them to unplanned purchases.

It has been indicated that the growing standards of personalization and new rules of customer

confidentiality will continue to require companies to be flexible and introduce new technologies in

order to adapt permanently their business to new conditions. Focusing on building trust with customers\ud
based on digital communications will enable companies to create a long-term integrated marketing

395143647,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Although knowledge of the microstructure of food of vegetal origin helps us to understand the behavior of food materials, the variability in the microstructural elements complicates this analysis. In this regard, the construction of learning models that represent the actual microstructures of the tissue is important to extract relevant information and advance in the comprehension of such behavior. Consequently, the objective of this research is to compare two machine learning techniques¿Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN)¿when used to enhance its microstructural analysis. Two main contributions can be highlighted from this research. First, a method is proposed to automatically analyze the microstructural elements of vegetal tissue; and second, a comparison was conducted to select a classifier to discriminate between tissue structures. For the comparison, a database of microstructural elements images was obtained from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) micrographs. Two classifiers were implemented using CNN and RBNN, and statistical performance metrics were computed using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. This process was repeated one hundred times with a random selection of images in each repetition. The comparison showed that the classifiers based on CNN produced a better fit, obtaining F1¿score average of 89.42% in front of 83.83% for RBNN. In this study, the performance of classifiers based on CNN was significantly higher compared to those based on RBNN in the discrimination of microstructural elements of vegetable foods.Oblitas, J.; Mejía, J.; De-La-Torre, M.; Avila-George, H.; Seguí Gil, L.; Mayor López, L.; Ibarz, A....

491014911,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Industry 4.0 has been a hot topic in recent years. The process of integrating Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, will become the trend in future construction of smart factories. In the past, smart factories were developed around the concept of the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). Most parts of the quality management process still needed to be implemented by Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) methods which required human resources and time to perform second stage testing. Screening standards also resulted in the elimination of about 30% of the products. In this study, we sort and analyze several Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and YOLO models that are currently more advanced and widely used, analyze the methods and development problems of the various models, and propose a suitable real-time image recognition model and architecture suitable for Integrated Circuit Board (ICB) in manufacturing process. The goal of the first stage of this study is to collect and use different types of ICBs as model training data sets, and establish a preliminary image recognition model that can classify and predict different types of ICBs based on different feature points. The second stage explores image augmentation fusion and optimization methods. The data augmentation method used in this study can reach an average accuracy of 96.53%. In the final stage, there is discussion of the applicability of the model to detect and recognize the ICB directionality in &lt;1 s with a 98% accuracy rate to meet the real-time requirements of smart manufacturing. Accurate and instant object image recognition in the smart manufacturing process can save manpower required for testing, improve equipment effectiveness, and increase both the production capacity and the yield rate of the production line.

The majority of DF patients still retain excitable nerves and muscles which makes Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) an adequate technique to restore lost mobility. Recent studies suggest the need for developing personalized and assist-as-needed control strategies for wearable FES in order to promote natural and functional movements while reducing the early onset of fatigue. This study contributes to a real-time implementation of a trajectory tracking FES control strategy for personalized DF correction. This strategy combines a feedforward Non-Linear Autoregressive Neural Network with Exogenous inputs (NARXNN) with a feedback PD controller. This control strategy advances with a user-specific TA muscle model achieved by the NARXNN’s ability to model dynamic systems relying on the foot angle and angular velocity as inputs. A closed-loop, fully wearable stimulation system was achieved using an ISTim stimulator and wearable inertial sensor for electrical stimulation and user’s kinematic gait sensing, respectively. Results showed that the NARXNN architecture with 2 hidden layers and 10 neurons provided the highest performance for modelling the kinematic behaviour of the TA muscle. The proposed trajectory tracking control revealed a low discrepancy between real and reference foot trajectories (goodness of fit = 77.87%) and time-effectiveness for correctly stimulating the TA muscle towards a natural gait and DF correction.This work has been supported by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) with the

491329298,2021-07-28T13:10:23,"Efficient video processing is a critical component in many IoMT applications to detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques have been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the incoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to the lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources, such as CCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same time, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally intensive deep neural network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at high-end (or cloud) nodes. This article presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage allied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud paradigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the query and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching. VID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video inference process across nodes. This article proposes a novel content-driven microbatch resizing , query-aware caching, and microbatch-based utility filtering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to improve the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive evaluations are performed over five real-world data sets. The experimental results show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves &#8764;2.3× higher throughput with minimal latency and ~99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines while maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds.peer-reviewe","[{'title': 'IEEE Internet of Things Journal', 'identifiers': ['issn:2327-4662', '2327-4662']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',VID-WIN: Fast video event matching with query-aware windowing at the edge for the internet of multimedia things,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3075336,https://core.ac.uk/download/491329298.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479298171,2021-07-01T00:00:00,"Machine vision with deep learning is a promising type of automatic visual perception for detecting and segmenting an object effectively; however, the scarcity of labelled datasets in agricultural fields prevents the application of deep learning to agriculture. For this reason, this study proposes weakly supervised crop area segmentation (WSCAS) to identify the uncut crop area efficiently for path guidance. Weakly supervised learning has advantage for training models because it entails less laborious annotation. The proposed method trains the classification model using area-specific images so that the target area can be segmented from the input image based on implicitly learned localization. This way makes the model implementation easy even with a small data scale. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using recorded video frames that were then compared with previous deep-learning-based segmentation methods. The results showed that the proposed method can be conducted with the lowest inference time and that the crop area can be localized with an intersection over union of approximately 0.94. Additionally, the uncut crop edge could be detected for practical use based on the segmentation results with post-image processing such as with a Canny edge detector and Hough transformation. The proposed method showed the significant ability of using automatic perception in agricultural navigation to infer the crop area with real-time level speed and have localization comparable to existing semantic segmentation methods. It is expected that our method will be used as essential tool for the automatic path guidance system of a combine harvester","[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",'MDPI AG',Weakly Supervised Crop Area Segmentation for an Autonomous Combine Harvester,10.3390/s21144801,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

480202172,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the most potent toxins, which are produced by Clostridium bacteria and cause the life-threatening disease of botulism in all vertebrates. Specifically, animal botulism represents a serious environmental and economic concern in animal production due to the high mortality rates observed during outbreaks. Despite the availability of vaccines against BoNT, there are still many outbreaks of botulism worldwide. Alternative assays capable of replacing the conventional in vivo assay in terms of rapid and sensitive quantification, and the applicability for on-site analysis, have long been perused. Herein, we present a simple, highly sensitive and label-free optical biosensor for real-time detection of BoNT serotype C using a porous silicon Fabry–Pérot interferometer. A competitive immunoassay coupled to a biochemical cascade reaction was adapted for optical signal amplification. The resulting insoluble precipitates accumulated within the nanostructure changed the reflectivity spectra by alternating the averaged refractive index. The augmented optical performance allowed for a linear response within the range of 10 to 10,000 pg mL−1 while presenting a detection limit of 4.8 pg mL−1. The practical aspect of the developed assay was verified using field BoNT holotoxins to exemplify the potential use of the developed optical approach for rapid bio-diagnosis of BoNT. The specificity and selectivity of the assay were successfully validated using an adjacent holotoxin relevant for farm animals (BoNT serotype D). Overall, this work sets the foundation for implementing a miniaturized interferometer for routine on-site botulism diagnosis, thus significantly reducing the need for animal experimentation and shortening analysis turnaround for early evidence-based therapy","[{'title': 'Chemosensors', 'identifiers': ['2227-9040', 'issn:2227-9040']}]",'MDPI AG',Botulinum Neurotoxin-C Detection Using Nanostructured Porous Silicon Interferometer,10.3390/chemosensors9080228,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478193234,2022-02-15T00:00:00,"The real-time, and accurate inference of model parameters is of great importance in many scientific and engineering disciplines that use computational models (such as a digital twin) for the analysis and prediction of complex physical processes. However, fast and accurate inference for processes of complex systems cannot easily be achieved in real-time with state-of-the-art methods under noisy real-world conditions with the requirement of a real-time response. The primary reason is that the inference of model parameters with traditional techniques based on optimization or sampling often suffers from computational and statistical challenges, resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and deployment time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and evaluated on two different physics-based models of turbofan engines.

479727970,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Background: Digital processing has enabled the development of several generations of technology for tinnitus therapy. The first digital generation was comprised of digital Hearing Aids (HAs) and personal digital music players implementing already established sound-based therapies, as well as text based information on the internet. In the second generation Smart-phone applications (apps) alone or in conjunction with HAs resulted in more therapy options for users to select from. The 3rd generation of digital tinnitus technologies began with the emergence of many novel, largely neurophysiologically-inspired, treatment theories that drove development of processing; enabled through HAs, apps, the internet and stand-alone devices. We are now of the cusp of a 4th generation that will incorporate physiological sensors, multiple transducers and AI to personalize therapies.Aim: To review technologies that will enable the next generations of digital therapies for tinnitus.Methods: A “state-of-the-art” review was undertaken to answer the question: what digital technology could be applied to tinnitus therapy in the next 10 years? Google Scholar and PubMed were searched for the 10-year period 2011–2021. The search strategy used the following key words: “tinnitus” and [“HA,” “personalized therapy,” “AI” (and “methods” or “applications”), “Virtual reality,” “Games,” “Sensors” and “Transducers”], and “Hearables.” Snowballing was used to expand the search from the identified papers. The results of the review were cataloged and organized into themes.Results: This paper identified digital technologies and research on the development of smart therapies for tinnitus. AI methods that could have tinnitus applications are identified and discussed. The potential of personalized treatments and the benefits of being able to gather data in ecologically valid settings are outlined.Conclusions: There is a huge scope for the application of digital technology to tinnitus therapy, but the uncertain mechanisms underpinning tinnitus present a challenge and many posited therapeutic approaches may not be successful. Personalized AI modeling based on biometric measures obtained through various sensor types, and assessments of individual psychology and lifestyles should result in the development of smart therapy platforms for tinnitus","[{'title': 'Frontiers in Digital Health', 'identifiers': ['issn:2673-253X', '2673-253x']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',A State-of-Art Review of Digital Technologies for the Next Generation of Tinnitus Therapeutics,10.3389/fdgth.2021.724370,https://core.ac.uk/download/479727970.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This article presents the design, development, implementation, and assessment of a Robotic Assistant (RA), named &#x201C;Atent&#x0040;&#x201D;, as a support tool in the homework activities of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Interacting with the children the RA helps them correct their bad habits and misbehavior caused by the disorder. Its features and functionalities were designed by therapists, implementing AI algorithms to process information and make decisions in real-time to help children to be focused on their homework. This RA interacts with smart objects deployed at home, which are associated with the activity under observation (desk and chair). This solution allows therapists to receive more accurate information about the homework sessions inside the home. At the same time, remote interaction with the child is made possible (through the RA) to provide new instructions and support him/her along with the sessions. This RA is a significant evolution of an earlier version. All the improvements brought to the project by the modifications in technical and qualitative features are explained. Furthermore, the experiment and its results are presented to illustrate the clinical potential.

482629957,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"Objective: Traditionally, cadaveric courses have been an important tool in surgical education for Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). The recent COVID-19 pandemic, however, has had a significant global impact on such courses due to its travel restrictions, social distancing regulations, and infection risk. Here, we report the world-first remote (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) FESS training course between Japan and Australia, utilizing novel 3D-printed sinus models. We examined the feasibility and educational effect of the course conducted entirely remotely with encrypted telemedicine software.Methods: Three otolaryngologists in Hokkaido, Japan, were trained to perform frontal sinus dissections on novel 3D sinus models of increasing difficulty, by two rhinologists located in Adelaide, South Australia. The advanced manufactured sinus models were 3D printed from the Computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Using Zoom and the Quintree telemedicine platform, the surgeons in Adelaide first lectured the Japanese surgeons on the Building Block Concept for a three Dimensional understanding of the frontal recess. They in real time directly supervised the surgeons as they planned and then performed the frontal sinus dissections. The Japanese surgeons were asked to complete a questionnaire pertaining to their experience and the time taken to perform the frontal dissection was recorded. The course was streamed to over 200 otolaryngologists worldwide.Results: All dissectors completed five frontal sinusotomies. The time to identify the frontal sinus drainage pathway (FSDP) significantly reduced from 1,292 ± 672 to 321 ± 267 s (p = 0.02), despite an increase in the difficulty of the frontal recess anatomy. Image analysis revealed the volume of FSDP was improved (2.36 ± 0.00 to 9.70 ± 1.49 ml, p = 0.014). Questionnaires showed the course's general benefit was 95.47 ± 5.13 in dissectors and 89.24 ± 15.75 in audiences.Conclusion: The combination of telemedicine software, web-conferencing technology, standardized 3D sinus models, and expert supervision, provides excellent training outcomes for surgeons in circumstances when classical surgical workshops cannot be realized","[{'title': 'Frontiers in Surgery', 'identifiers': ['issn:2296-875X', '2296-875x']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',Remote Training of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery With Advanced Manufactured 3D Sinus Models and a Telemedicine System,10.3389/fsurg.2021.746837,https://core.ac.uk/download/482629957.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478368787,2021-02-15T00:00:00,"Introduction: Busia County of Kenya with a Human Immune-deficiency Virus prevalence rate of 7.7% is two-fold higher than the Kenyan national prevalence at 4.9%. Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is standard care for all HIV infected patients to mitigate viral loads. The current ARV therapy coverage in the county is 95% among adults. Recently there has been an observation of virologic failure due to viral drug resistance. Limited information on HIV-1 drug-resistance exists with the ARV therapy scale-up in the county. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the existing&nbsp; -1 drug-resistant mutations among adults in Busia County attributable to virological failure.Materials and Methodology: The samples were analyzed for viral load and HIV-1 drug-resistance targeting the pol gene. Viral load was detected and quantified by real time PCR. Alignment of sequences was done using Recall software and HIV-1 drug-resistance was determined by Stanford University HIV database.Results: Of 50 samples, 37(74.0%) had mutations and 34(68.0%) had viral loads of 1000cp/ml and above. Generally, a total of 142 (82 in males and 60 in females) mutations were detected. M184V, K65R, K70R, D67N and T215F were the predominant mutations encoding resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. K103N, Y181C, G190A and K101E were predominant to nonnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations. L231, V82A, 150L, E138G, G48V, I501T, I54V and M461were the protease inhibitor mutations identified. About 30(60%) samples had mutations encoding for NRTIs, 34(68%) for NNRTIs, and 6(12%) for PIs ARVs. We observed an association between samples with mutations and viral load of 1000 cp/ml and above (Fisher’s exact test of &lt;0.05) and virological failure especially in males (Fisher’s exact test of 0.013).Conclusion: There is need for the change in the recombination of treatment regimens especially the NNRTIs and NRTIs as first line therapy. There is also need for more investigations as to why males are resisting drugs than females, this will inform intervention. Routine HIV drug-resistance testing is needed before the initiation of any ARVs. This will minimize resistance.

493124263,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] This paper introduces an open-source platform to support serverless computing for scientific data-processing workflow-based applications across the Cloud continuum (i.e. simultaneously involving both on-premises and public Cloud platforms to process data captured at the edge). This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.The authors would like to thank the European Union for the project ""Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum"" (AI-SPRINT), with code 101016577, funded under the H2020 Framework Programme and also the regional government of the Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) for the project IDIFEDER/2018/032 (High-Performance Algorithms for the Modeling, Simulation and early Detection of diseases in Personalized Medicine), co-funded by the European Union ERDF funds (European Regional Development Fund) of the Comunitat Valenciana 2014-2020.Risco, S.; Moltó, G.; Naranjo-Delgado, DM.; Blanquer Espert, I.

478204378,2021-08-26T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods & Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of > 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P < 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",,'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,10.22456/1679-9216.111167,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As laboratory tests consume much time, and existing field tests have excessive limitations, a more comprehensive method is in great need. This is the first time a study proposes machine learning algorithms for real-time gutter oil detection under multiple feature dimensions. Moreover, it is deployed on FPGA to be low-power and portable for actual use. Firstly, a variety of oil samples are generated by simulating the real detection environment. Next, based on previous studies, sensors are used to collect significant features that help distinguish gutter oil. Then, the acquired features are filtered and compared using a variety of classifiers. The best classification result is obtained by k-NN with an accuracy of 97.18%, and the algorithm is deployed to FPGA with no significant loss of accuracy. Power consumption is further reduced with the approximate multiplier we designed. Finally, the experimental results show that compared with all other platforms, the whole FPGA-based classification process consumes 4.77 µs and the power consumption is 65.62 mW.

526326756,2022-01-18T00:00:00,"In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the achievable image resolution is typically limited by several pre-fixed characteristics of the x-ray source and detector. Structuring the x-ray beam using a mask with alternating opaque and transmitting septa can overcome this limit. However, the use of a mask imposes an undersampling problem: to obtain complete datasets, significant lateral sample stepping is needed in addition to the sample rotation, resulting in high x-ray doses and long acquisition times. Cycloidal CT, an alternative scanning scheme by which the sample is rotated and translated simultaneously, can provide high aperture-driven resolution without sample stepping, resulting in a lower radiation dose and faster scans. However, cycloidal sinograms are incomplete and must be restored before tomographic images can be computed. In this work, we demonstrate that high-quality images can be reconstructed by applying the recently proposed Mixed Scale Dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to this task. We also propose a novel training approach by which training data are acquired as part of each scan, thus removing the need for large sets of pre-existing reference data, the acquisition of which is often not practicable or possible. We present results for both simulated datasets and real-world data, showing that the combination of cycloidal CT and machine learning-based data recovery can lead to accurate high-resolution images at a limited dose.Algorithms and the Foundations of Software technolog",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Cycloidal CT with CNN-based sinogram completion and in-scan generation of training data,10.1038/s41598-022-04910-y,https://core.ac.uk/download/526326756.pdf,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper analyzes the rate-distortion-complexity characteristics of the VVC reference software (VTM10.0) by using HEVC reference software (HM16.22) as an anchor. In this independent study, the rate-distortion performance of VTM was benchmarked against HM with the objective PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF quality metrics and the associated encoder and decoder complexities were profiled at function level using Intel VTune Profiler on Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 22-core processors. For a fair comparison, all our experiments were conducted under the VTM common test conditions (CTC) that define 10-bit configurations of the VTM codec for the addressed All Intra (AI), Random Access (RA), and Low Delay B (LB) conditions. The VTM CTC test set was also extended with complementary 4K UHD sequences to elaborate RD characteristics with higher resolutions. According to our evaluations, VTM improves the average coding efficiency over HM, depending on quality metric, by 23.0&#x2013;23.9% under the AI condition, 33.1&#x2013;36.6% under the RA condition, and 26.7&#x2013;29.5% under the LB condition. However, the coding gain of VTM comes with 34.0&#x00D7;, 8.8&#x00D7;, and 7.5&#x00D7; encoding complexity over that of HM under the AI, RA, and LB conditions, respectively. The corresponding overhead of the VTM decoder stays steady at 1.8&#x00D7; across all conditions.

The purpose of this case study was to provide insight into the lived reality of using the assistive robotic exoskeleton ReWalk.Method: We used ethnographic techniques to explore the everyday experience and use of the assistive robotic device.Results: We found that the appropriation and integration of the technology within the patient's everyday lives required a social and collaborative effort, which continued into use. The decisions to utilise the technology (or not) was closely tied to physical, social, cultural, environmental, and psychological factors. Consequently, there was much variation in patients' perception of the technology and opportunities for support. Four themes emerged:(a) Meaning of mobility—physical mobility represents more than functional ability. Its present socio-cultural meaning is associated with an individual's self-identity and life priorities.(b) Accomplishing body-technique—integration with the body requires a long process of skill acquisition and re-embodiment.(c) Adaptation and adjustment in use—successful use of the technology was characterised by ongoing adjustment and adaptation of the technology and ways of using it.(d) Human element—introduction and sustained use of the exoskeleton demand a social and collaborative effort across the user's professional and lay resources.Conclusions: This study highlights that the development and implementation of the technology need to be grounded in a deep understanding of the day-to-day lives and experiences of the people that use them","[{'title': 'Frontiers in Medical Technology', 'identifiers': ['issn:2673-3129', '2673-3129']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',Living With Assistive Robotics: Exploring the Everyday Use of Exoskeleton for Persons With Spinal Cord Injury,10.3389/fmedt.2021.747632,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It shows how collisions with other RF signals present in the ISM band are diminished for a given IoT device. Then we describe the first implementation of learning algorithms on LoRa devices operating in a real LoRaWAN network, that we named IoTligent. The proposed solution adds neither processing overhead so that it can be ran in the IoT devices, nor network overhead so that no change is required to LoRaWAN.

Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.Peer reviewe",'Elsevier BV',Partially RepRapable automated open source bag valve mask-based ventilator,10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00131,,"[{'title': 'HardwareX', 'identifiers': ['issn:2468-0672', '2468-0672']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The final version is available from Springer Verlad via the DOI in this recordRecent advances in “developmental” approach (combining experimental study with computational modeling) of neural networks produce increasingly large data sets, in both complexity and size. This poses a significant challenge in analyzing, visualizing and understanding not only the spatial structure but also the behavior of such networks. This paper describes a virtual reality application for visualization of two biologically accurate computational models that model the anatomical structure of a neural network comprised of 1500 neurons and over 80,000 connections. The visualization enables a user to observe the complex spatiotemporal interplay between seven unique types of neurons culminating in an observable swimming pattern.

429122164,2020-08-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The paper presents the results of the Battle of Postdisaster Response and Restoration (BPDRR) presented in a special session at the first International water distribution systems analysis & computing and control in the water industry (WDSA/CCWI) Joint Conference, held in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in July 2018. The BPDRR problem focused on how to respond and restore water service after the occurrence of five earthquake scenarios that cause structural damage in a water distribution system. Participants were required to propose a prioritization schedule to fix the damages of each scenario while following restrictions on visibility/nonvisibility of damages. Each team/approach was evaluated against six performance criteria: (1) time without supply for hospital/firefighting, (2) rapidity of recovery, (3) resilience loss, (4) average time of no user service, (5) number of users without service for eight consecutive hours, and (6) water loss. Three main types of approaches were identified from the submissions: (1) general-purpose metaheuristic algorithms, (2) greedy algorithms, and (3) ranking-based prioritizations. All three approaches showed potential to solve the challenge efficiently. The results of the participants showed that for this network, the impact of a large-diameter pipe failure on the network is more significant than several smaller pipes failures. The location of isolation valves and the size of hydraulic segments influenced the resilience of the system during emergencies. On average, the interruptions to water supply (hospitals and firefighting) varied considerably among solutions and emergency scenarios, highlighting the importance of private water storage for emergencies. The effects of damages and repair work were more noticeable during the peak demand periods (morning and noontime) than during the low-flow periods; and tank storage helped to preserve functionality of the network in the first few hours after a simulated event.

328720905,2020-08-28T14:06:08,"The “time-varying loudness” (TVL) model of Glasberg and Moore calculates “instantaneous loudness” every 1 ms, and this is used to generate predictions of short-term loudness, the loudness of a short segment of sound, such as a word in a sentence, and of long-term loudness, the loudness of a longer segment of sound, such as a whole sentence. The calculation of instantaneous loudness is computationally intensive and real-time implementation of the TVL model is difficult. To speed up the computation, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict instantaneous loudness using a large database of speech sounds and artificial sounds (tones alone and tones in white or pink noise), with the predictions of the TVL model as a reference (providing the “correct” answer, specifically the loudness level in phons). A multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers was found to be sufficient, with more complex DNN architecture not yielding higher accuracy. After training, the deviations between the predictions of the TVL model and the predictions of the DNN were typically less than 0.5 phons, even for types of sounds that were not used for training (music, rain, animal sounds, and washing machine). The DNN calculates instantaneous loudness over 100 times more quickly than the TVL model. Possible applications of the DNN are discussed",Trends in Hearing,Development of a Deep Neural Network for Speeding Up a Model of Loudness for Time-Varying Sounds,10.17863/CAM.56818,https://core.ac.uk/download/328720905.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
441438944,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"A lack of sensory feedback often hinders minimally invasive operations. Although endoscopy has addressed this limitation to an extent, endovascular procedures such as angioplasty or stenting still face significant challenges. Sensors that rely on a clear line of sight cannot be used because it is unable to gather feedback in blood environments. During the stent deployment procedure, feedback on the deployed stent's state is critical because a partially open stent can affect the blood flow. Despite this, no robust and noninvasive clinical solutions that allow real‐time monitoring of the stent deployment exists. In recent years, radio frequency (RF)‐based sensors can detect the shape and material of an object that is hidden from the direct line of sight. Herein, the use of a 3D RF‐based imaging sensor and a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called StentNet is proposed for detecting the stent's state without a need for a clear line of sight. The StentNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90% in detecting the state of an occluded stent in the test dataset. Compared with an existing CNN model, the StentNet significantly outperforms the 3D LeNet in the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‐score",'Wiley',Stent Deployment Detection Using Radio Frequency‐Based Sensor and Convolutional Neural Networks,10.1002/aisy.202000092,,"[{'title': 'Advanced Intelligent Systems', 'identifiers': ['2640-4567', 'issn:2640-4567']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
390009408,2020-02-20T00:00:00,"Methods of machine intelligence with training contribute their specifics to the creation and commissioning of a gaming system.One of the main problems is the need to anticipate the entire set of input situations and possible answers at the time of design and the impossibility of expanding their list withoutretraining. This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.Методы машинного интеллекта с обучением вносят свою специфику к созданию и наладке игровой системы.Одна из главных проблем — это необходимость предвидения всего набора входных ситуаций и возможных ответов на моменте проектирования и невозможность расширения их списка без переобучения.

387876374,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Volume and ejection fraction (EF) measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in 2-D echocardiography are associated with a high uncertainty not only due to interobserver variability of the manual measurement, but also due to ultrasound acquisition errors such as apical foreshortening. In this work, a real-time and fully automated EF measurement and foreshortening detection method is proposed. The method uses several deep learning components, such as view classification, cardiac cycle timing, segmentation and landmark extraction, to measure the amount of foreshortening, LV volume, and EF. A data set of 500 patients from an outpatient clinic was used to train the deep neural networks, while a separate data set of 100 patients from another clinic was used for evaluation, where LV volume and EF were measured by an expert using clinical protocols and software. A quantitative analysis using 3-D ultrasound showed that EF is considerably affected by apical foreshortening, and that the proposed method can detect and quantify the amount of apical foreshortening. The bias and standard deviation of the automatic EF measurements were -3.6 ± 8.1%, while the mean absolute difference was measured at 7.2% which are all within the interobserver variability and comparable with related studies. The proposed real-time pipeline allows for a continuous acquisition and measurement workflow without user interaction, and has the potential to significantly reduce the time spent on the analysis and measurement error due to foreshortening, while providing quantitative volume measurements in the everyday echo lab",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Real-Time Automatic Ejection Fraction and Foreshortening Detection Using Deep Learning,10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2981037,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

333567050,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"In recent year, embedded systems architectures and applications have gained a lot of interest, especially the possibility to add on-bard intelligence has fostered research in several directions, including not only smart IoT and cyber physical systems, but also hot topics such as accelerating deep learning. This special issue contains four papers dealing with architectures and design methodologies to support embedded intelligence, but also providing best practices and software support.



The paper “A Technologically Agnostic Framework for Cyber-Physical and IoT Processing-in-Memory-based Systems Simulation”, by Santos et al., aims to focus on Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a solution for efficiently processing big data. In particular, this work presents a framework to simulate and automatically generate code for IoT PIM-based systems. Moreover, it proposes an high speed and energy efficient architecture for an IoT PIM system, able to compute a real image recognition application.



The paper “Recommender system implementations for embedded collaborative filtering applications”, by Pajuelo-Holguera et al., aims to propose a complete recommender system implemented on reconfigurable hardware with the purpose of testing on-chip, low-energy embedded collaborative filtering applications. The proposed approach solves any prediction problem based on collaborative filtering by using an off-line, highly-portable light computing environment. Moreover, this work exploits a custom, fine-grained parallel circuit for quick matrix multiplication with floating-point numbers.



The paper “SystemC-based Electronic System-Level Design Space Exploration Environment for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems”, by Pomante et al., faces the problem of the Electronic System-Level (ESL) HW/SW co-design of dedicated electronic digital systems based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures. In particular, the work presents a prototype SystemC -based environment that exploits a Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach able to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the system specification and a mapping onto an automatically defined architecture.



The paper “A Fast and Scalable Architecture to Run Convolutional Neural Networks in Low Density FPGAs”, by Véstias et al., deals with efficient configurable architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) inference targeting any density FPGAs. The architecture exploits fixed-point arithmetic and image batch to reduce computational, memory and memory bandwidth requirements without compromising network accuracy.



In conclusion, this special issue offers some timely contributions to advance the research of intelligent embedded systems by analyzing both architectures and applications. All of four papers are worth reading and will inspire more interesting ideas and research topics.

289226841,2020,"The subject matter of the article is the process of developing information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles arises. The goal of the study is to development of the main points for information technology of automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles. The tasks to be solved are: the structural diagram of the preparatory stage of information technology for automated detection and identification of stationary objects is constructed; the structural diagram of the basic, additional and final stages of information technology automated detection and identification of fixed objects is constructed. General scientific and special methods of scientific knowledge are used. One of the most effective approaches to the recognition and identification of objects is an approach based on the use of deep learning methods. A new model of UAV motion is proposed based on image recognition methods. The methods of pattern recognition with application of neural networks are considered in detail in this work too. The following results are obtained. The developed information technology is implemented in four stages: preparatory, basic, additional and final. Each stage consists of separate procedures aimed at collecting, processing, storing and transmitting information during the flight UAV. Conclusions. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles is based on the knowledge-oriented representation of the stages of image processing of objects on digital aerial photographs on board the UAV. This allows to provide intelligent real-time data processing, changing UAV flight routes depending on the objects detected to improve the effectiveness of the search tasks. Further development of this information technology lies in the development of automated methods of planning UAV routes, automatic change of route parameters in flight processes (performance of a flight task), based on knowledge-oriented technologies. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles can become an element of intelligent decision support systems for the use of UAVs (teams of UAVs) to search for both stationary and dynamic objects.Предметом вивчення в статті є процес розробки інформаційної технології автоматизованого виявлення та ідентифікації стаціонарних об'єктів безпілотними літальними апаратами.

429686511,2020-03-25T00:00:00,"We present a deep learning-based multitask framework for joint 3D human pose estimation and action recognition from RGB sensors using simple cameras. The approach proceeds along two stages. In the first, a real-time 2D pose detector is run to determine the precise pixel location of important keypoints of the human body. A two-stream deep neural network is then designed and trained to map detected 2D keypoints into 3D poses. In the second stage, the Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithm is deployed to find an optimal network architecture that is used for modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of the estimated 3D poses via an image-based intermediate representation and performing action recognition. Experiments on Human3.6M, MSR Action3D and SBU Kinect Interaction datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the targeted tasks. Moreover, we show that the method requires a low computational budget for training and inference. In particular, the experimental results show that by using a monocular RGB sensor, we can develop a 3D pose estimation and human action recognition approach that reaches the performance of RGB-depth sensors. This opens up many opportunities for leveraging RGB cameras (which are much cheaper than depth cameras and extensively deployed in private and public places) to build intelligent recognition systems.Sergio A.

287167378,2020-01-22T00:00:00,"In this article, I review the concept of algorithmic generative and interactive music and discuss the advantages and challenges of its implementation in videogames. Excessive repetition caused by low interactivity in music sequences through gameplay has been tackled primarily by using random or sequential containers, coupled with overlapping rules and adaptive mix parameters, as demonstrated in the Dynamic Music Units in Audiokinetic’s Wwise middleware. This approach provides a higher variety through re-combinatorial properties of music tracks and also a responsive and interactive music stream. However, it mainly uses prerecorded music sequences that reappear and are easy to recognize throughout gameplay. Generative principles such as single-seed design have been occasionally applied in game music scoring to generate material. Some of them are complemented with rules and are assigned to sections with low emotional requirements, but support for real-time interaction in gameplay situations, although desirable, is rarely found.While algorithmic note-by-note generation can offer interactive flexibility and infinite diversity, it poses significant challenges such as achieving human-like performativity and producing a distinctive narrative style through measurable parameters or program arguments. Starting with music generation, I examine conceptual implementations and technical challenges of algorithmic composition studies that use Markov models, a-life/evolutionary music, generative grammars, agents, and artificial neural networks/deep learning. For each model, I evaluate rule-based strategies for interactive music transformation using parameters provided by contextual gameplay situations. Finally, I propose a compositional tool design based in modular instances of algorithmic music generation, featuring stylistic interactive control in connection with an audio engine rendering system",'Aarhus University Library',Algorithmic interactive music generation in videogames: A modular design for adaptive automatic music scoring,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

429122002,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Pineapple is an economically important tropical fruit crop, but the lack of adequate planting material limits its productivity.
A range of micropropagation protocols has been developed over the years to address this shortfall. Still, the final stage of
micropropagation, i.e. acclimatisation, remains a challenge as pineapple plantlets grow very slowly. Several studies have been
conducted focusing on this phase and attempting to improve plantlet growth and establishment, which requires tools for the
non-destructive evaluation of growth during acclimatisation. This report describes the use of semi-automated and automated image analysis to quantify canopy growth of pineapple plantlets, during five months of acclimatisation. The canopy area progressively
increased during acclimatisation, particularly after 90 days. Regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between the automated image analysis and morphological indicators of growth. The mathematical relationships between estimations of the canopy area and the fresh and dry weights of intact plantlets, middle-aged leaves (D leaves) and roots showed determination coefficients (R2) between 0.84 and 0.92. We propose an appropriate tool for the simple, objective and non-destructive evaluation of pineapple plantlets growth, which can be generally applied for plant phenotyping, to reduce costs and develop streamlined pipelines for the assessment of plant growthThis research was not covered by any specific grant but supported by internal funds from the Bioplant Centre (Cuba), the Agricultural Research Council-Tropical and Subtropical Crops (South Africa), and the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (Spain).

323366399,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"La colorización es la asignación de posibles colores a los objetos que componen la imagen en escala de grises de forma que correspondan a los reales. La colorización plantea un reto específico en visión computarizada para la reconstrucción de imágenes y video, tales como, la búsqueda de una fiel aproximación, la saturación correcta de colores escogidos y áreas no desfasadas.
La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
Proponemos el diseño e implementación de una herramienta de restauración de imágenes históricas de la ciudad de Barranquilla realizándoles un coloreado por medio de herramientas de computer vision. Cayena, nuestra aplicación web presenta una galería de imágenes de la historia de Barranquilla y de forma interactiva permite realizarles el coloreado. Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
We propose the design and implementation of a image restoration tool for historical images of the city of Barranquilla by applying a colorization using computer vision techniques. Cayena, our web application displays a gallery of historical images of Barranquilla and interactively allows to colorize them. In order to apply the colorization the application makes a request to our API that hosts the service and executes the colorization process; this colorization process consists in the processing of the image so it has the right size and the verification to make sure it is a grayscale image and transform it if it is not, and the subsequent execution of an pre trained CNN model using the Deep Learning framework ‘Caffe’ which predicts the possible real colors of the image","Barranquilla, Universidad del Norte, 2020",Automated colorization using Computer Vision tools for restoring historical images of the city of Barranquilla,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Deep learning models are clear cut techniques for this purpose. This paper’s fundamental purpose is to automatically detect leakage in tanks during production with more reliability than a manual inspection, a common practice in industries. This research proposes an inspection system to predict tank leakage using hydrophone sensor data and deep learning algorithms after production. In this paper, leak detection was investigated using an experimental setup consisting of a plastic tank immersed underwater. Three different techniques for this purpose were implemented and compared with each other, including fast Fourier transform (FFT), wavelet transforms, and time-domain features, all of which are followed with 1D convolution neural network (1D-CNN). Applying FFT and converting the signal to a 1D image followed by 1D-CNN showed better results than other methods.

372560235,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"In the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen a massive improvement, outperforming other visual recognition algorithms. Since they are playing an increasingly important role in fields such as face recognition, augmented reality or autonomous driving, there is the growing need for a fast and efficient system to perform the redundant and heavy computations of CNNs. This trend led researchers towards heterogeneous systems provided with hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The vast majority of CNNs is implemented with floating-point parameters and operations, but from research, it has emerged that high classification accuracy can be obtained also by reducing the floating-point activations and weights to binary values. This context is well suitable for FPGAs, that are known to stand out in terms of performance when dealing with binary operations, as demonstrated in FINN, the state-of-the-art framework for building Binarized Neural Network (BNN) accelerators on FPGAs.

387263536,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Significance: Multi-exposure laser speckle contrast imaging (MELSCI) estimates microcirculatory blood perfusion more accurately than single-exposure LSCI. However, the technique has been hampered by technical limitations due to massive data throughput requirements and nonlinear inverse search algorithms, limiting it to an offline technique where data must be postprocessed. Aim: To present an MELSCI system capable of continuous acquisition and processing of MELSCI data, enabling real-time video-rate perfusion imaging with high accuracy. Approach: The MELSCI algorithm was implemented in programmable hardware (field programmable gate array) closely interfaced to a high-speed CMOS sensor for real-time calculation. Perfusion images were estimated in real-time from the MELSCI data using an artificial neural network trained on simulated data. The MELSCI perfusion was compared to two existing single-exposure metrics both quantitatively in a controlled phantom experiment and qualitatively in vivo. Results: The MELSCI perfusion shows higher signal dynamics compared to both single-exposure metrics, both spatially and temporally where heartbeat-related variations are resolved in much greater detail. The MELSCI perfusion is less susceptible to measurement noise and is more linear with respect to laser Doppler perfusion in the phantom experiment (R-2 = 0.992). Conclusions: The presented MELSCI system allows for real-time acquisition and calculation of high-quality perfusion at 15.6 frames per second. (C) The Authors.

346367817,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, mm-Pose, a novel approach to detect and track human skeletons in real-time using an mmWave radar, is proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation. The proposed method was tested for a single human scenario for four primary motions, (i) Walking, (ii) Swinging left arm, (iii) Swinging right arm, and (iv) Swinging both arms to validate accurate predictions for motion in range, azimuth and elevation.

Since the use of mobile phones has become very common among people, one of the most convenient solutions may be to use mobile phones for this process. However, such a solution has some disadvantages, because the evaluation of the symptoms is not enough to detect the disease. Such technical solutions will not produce an exact solution that a patient has COVID-19, but it may be possible to increase its accuracy by feeding the system with more detailed data. In this study, we propose a digital twin-based system in which a digital copy of each individual is created. This copy will be in the cloud and will have the entire medical history of the individual. It will also be fed continuously with real-time measurements. This data can be obtained from mobile devices, the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) or any measurement made from doctor reports. The system will be able to process data from sensors that can sample body temperature, blood, or saliva. Data such as cough, respiratory routines, skin color and temperature will be processed and analyzed through decision making processes. Decision making processes will be implemented in the cloud with machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence methods. The individual will be able to see his/her health status on his/her mobile device with the analysis of his/her digital twin. When medical data are anonymized, they can be shared for research purposes. In addition, this data can be kept confidential on the mobile device or encrypted in the cloud.

First, we describe the hardware and software solution employed to build the system. Second, we detail the machine learning methods used for the automatic recognition of the users' mental workload, which are based on the well-known Random Forest algorithm. In order to gather data to train the system, we conducted an extensive user study with 75 participants using a VR flight simulator to induce different levels of mental workload. In contrast to previous works which label the data based on a standardized task (e.g. n-back task) or on a pre-defined task-difficulty, participants were asked about their perceived mental workload level along the experiment. With the data collected, we were able to train the system in order to classify four different levels of mental workload with an accuracy up to 65%. In addition, we discuss the role of the signal normalization procedures, the contribution of the different physiological signals on the recognition accuracy and compare the results obtained with the sensors embedded in the HMD with commercial grade systems. Preliminary results show our pipeline is able to recognize mental workload in real-time.

Although the calculation of the exact solutions of all the linear systems provided by the use of the Lagrangian naturally gives the best optimization result, the huge number of such systems that appear when the time variable increases makes it necessary to use numerical methods.

287655427,2020-03-09T16:04:06,"Recent advances in “developmental” approach (combining experimental study with computational modelling) of neural networks produces increasingly large data sets, in both complexity and size. This poses a significant challenge in analyzing, visualizing and understanding not only the spatial structure but also the behavior of such networks. This paper describes a Virtual Reality application for visualization of two biologically accurate computational models that model the anatomical structure of a neural network comprised of 1,500 neurons and over 80,000 connections. The visualization enables a user to observe the complex spatio-temporal interplay between seven unique types of neurons culminating in an observable swimming pattern. We present a detailed description of the design approach for the virtual environment, based on a set of initial requirements, followed up by the implementation and optimization steps. Lastly, the results of a pilot usability study are being presented on how confident participants are in their ability to understand how the alternating firing pattern between the two sides of the tadpole’s body generate swimming motion",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Tadpole VR: virtual reality visualization of a simulated tadpole spinal cord,10.1007/s10055-020-00431-z,https://core.ac.uk/download/287655427.pdf,"[{'title': 'Virtual Reality', 'identifiers': ['issn:1434-9957', 'issn:1359-4338', '1359-4338', '1434-9957']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Yet, in language and literacy teaching, little is known about using AR to enhance inquiry learning, and to encourage students to experiment with affordances of new media to develop critical and creative knowledge. Although teachers are expected to support students in learning, both with and through new digital forms, there is a slow uptake of new media, such as AR, in Australian contexts. This is possibly due to a lack of mainstream understanding about what AR is and what educational affordances it offers. The lack of classroom research and a “conceptual framework regarding the implementation of technologies such as Augmented Reality system” remain an impeding factor to effective explorations of AR in education (Bower et al., 2014, p.7)","Marrickville, N.S.W., Primary English Teaching Association Australia","Teaching language, literacy and literature using augmented reality : an introduction to AR apps and their potential for classroom use",,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322656801,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In any water utility, a reliable assessment of the service life of the network pipes is a key piece within the big puzzle of assets management. This paper presents a new statistical model (basic pipes life assessment, BPLA) to assess the service life of pipes, to locate the pipes on the failures bath curve and to forecast the expected failures in future years. Its main novelties are the processing of pipe information (is that information what is adapted to the classical maintenance engineering and not the other way back) and the definition of two different time variables that can be analyzed in parallel. The first novelty makes the model less demanding in terms of data and software tools than others currently available, and the second one allows to get all the results after one single stage of calculation. To show its usability, the BPLA has been applied to a pipe network that supplies water to 500,000 citizens for which two years of failure records are available. Procedures and results have been compared to the well-known Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM), with final relative errors lower than 10% and 15% on each particular result.The authors would like to thank Global Omnium for the support provided, both directly and through the Catedra Aguas de Valencia of the UPV, for the development of the works presented in this paper.Ramírez-Aguilar, RX.; López Jiménez, PA.; Torres Toro, D.; Cobacho Jordán, R.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

355099865,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Abstract: Poor management practices of road transport assets posed a challenge to the sustainable development of the transport system in developing countries like Nigeria. Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria. The study identified 4.0IR drivers to include; robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 3D printing drones that are built with an attached 3D printer, (the drone hangs a 3D printing nozzle that's fed plastic, concrete mix or other material from a tube connected to the top of the drone's printing path that precisely plotted by software, for a promised printing accuracy of 0.1mm),and digital engineering. This study emanated from the government reports and past studies in the area of road transport asset management practice which the study investigated the major causes of poor practices and assessed the effect of the fourth industrial revolution on the practice",,Effect of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on Road Transport Asset Management Practice in Nigeria,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

First, we describe the hardware and software solution employed to build the system. Second, we detail the machine learning methods used for the automatic recognition of the users' mental workload, which are based on the well-known Random Forest algorithm. In order to gather data to train the system, we conducted an extensive user study with 75 participants using a VR flight simulator to induce different levels of mental workload. In contrast to previous works which label the data based on a standardized task (e.g. n-back task) or on a pre-defined task-difficulty, participants were asked about their perceived mental workload level along the experiment. With the data collected, we were able to train the system in order to classify four different levels of mental workload with an accuracy up to 65%. In addition, we discuss the role of the signal normalization procedures, the contribution of the different physiological signals on the recognition accuracy and compare the results obtained with the sensors embedded in the HMD with commercial grade systems. Preliminary results show our pipeline is able to recognize mental workload in real-time. Taken together, our results suggest that such all-in-one approach, with physiological sensors directly embedded in the HMD, is a promising path for VR applications in which the real-time or off-line estimation of Mental Workload assessment is beneficial",HAL CCSD,Towards Real-Time Recognition of Users' Mental Workload Using Integrated Physiological Sensors Into a VR HMD,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
477988005,2020-08-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Increasing waste generation has become a significant issue over the globe due to the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. In the literature, many issues that have a direct impact on the increase of waste and the improper disposal of waste have been investigated. Most of the existing work in the literature has focused on providing a cost-efficient solution for the monitoring of garbage collection system using the Internet of Things (IoT). Though an IoT-based solution provides the real-time monitoring of a garbage collection system, it is limited to control the spreading of overspill and bad odor blowout gasses. The poor and inadequate disposal of waste produces toxic gases, and radiation in the environment has adverse effects on human health, the greenhouse system, and global warming. While considering the importance of air pollutants, it is imperative to monitor and forecast the concentration of air pollutants in addition to the management of the waste. In this paper, we present and IoT-based smart bin using a machine and deep learning model to manage the disposal of garbage and to forecast the air pollutant present in the surrounding bin environment. The smart bin is connected to an IoT-based server, the Google Cloud Server (GCP), which performs the computation necessary for predicting the status of the bin and for forecasting air quality based on real-time data. We experimented with a traditional model (k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and logistic reg) and a non-traditional (long short term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning) algorithm for the creation of alert messages regarding bin status and forecasting the amount of air pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) present in the air at a specific instance. The recalls of logistic regression and k-NN algorithm is 79% and 83%, respectively, in a real-time testing environment for predicting the status of the bin. The accuracy of modified LSTM and simple LSTM models is 90% and 88%, respectively, to predict the future concentration of gases present in the air. The system resulted in a delay of 4 s in the creation and transmission of the alert message to a sanitary worker. The system provided the real-time monitoring of garbage levels along with notifications from the alert mechanism. The proposed works provide improved accuracy by utilizing machine learning as compared to existing solutions based on simple approaches.This research work was funded by the Ministry of Education and the Deanship of Scientific Research, Najran University.

334971119,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic (ES) pressure volume relationship (ESPVR) is the cornerstone of systolic LV function analysis. We describe a 2D real-time (RT) MRI-based method (RTPVR) with separate software tools for 1) semi-automatic level set-based shape prior method (LSSPM) of the LV, 2) generation of synchronized pressure area loops and 3) calculation of the ESPVR. We used the RTPVR method to measure ventricular geometry, ES pressure area relationship (ESPAR) and ESPVR during vena cava occlusion (VCO) in normal sheep. 14 adult sheep were anesthetized and underwent measurement of LV systolic function. Ten of the 14 sheep underwent RTMRI and eight of the 14 underwent measurement with conductance catheter; 4 had both RTMRI and conductance measurements. 2D cross sectional RTMRI were performed at apex, mid-ventricle and base levels during separate VCOs. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to compare LSSPM and manual image segmentation and thus determine LSSPM accuracy. LV cross-sectional area, major and minor axis length, axis ratio, major axis orientation angle and ESPAR were measured at each LV level. ESPVR was calculated with a trapezoidal rule. The Dice similarity coefficient between LSSPM and manual segmentation by two readers was 87.31±2.51% and 88.13±3.43%. All cross sections became more elliptical during VCO. The major axis orientation shifted during VCO but remained in the septo-lateral direction. LV chamber obliteration at the apical level occurred during VCO in 7 of 10 sheep that underwent RTMRI. ESPAR was non-linear at all levels. Finally, ESPVR was non-linear because of apical collapse. ESPVR measured by conductance catheter (EES,Index = 2.23±0.66 mmHg/ml/m2) and RT (EES,Index = 2.31±0.31 mmHg/ml/m2) was not significantly different. LSSPM segmentation of 2D RT MRI images is accurate and allows calculation of LV geometry, ESPAR and ESPVR during VCO. In the future, RTPVR will facilitate determination of regional systolic material parameters underlying ESPVR","eScholarship, University of California",Left ventricular geometry during unloading and the end-systolic pressure volume relationship: Measurement with a modified real-time MRI-based method in normal sheep.,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
441318275,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Nowadays, much research attention is focused on human–computer interaction (HCI), specifically in terms of biosignal, which has been recently used for the remote controlling to offer benefits especially for disabled people or protecting against contagions, such as coronavirus. In this paper, a biosignal type, namely, facial emotional signal, is proposed to control electronic devices remotely via emotional vision recognition. The objective is converting only two facial emotions: a smiling or nonsmiling vision signal captured by the camera into a remote control signal. The methodology is achieved by combining machine learning (for smiling recognition) and embedded systems (for remote control IoT) fields. In terms of the smiling recognition, GENKl-4K database is exploited to train a model, which is built in the following sequenced steps: real-time video, snapshot image, preprocessing, face detection, feature extraction using HOG, and then finally SVM for the classification. The achieved recognition rate is up to 89% for the training and testing with 10-fold validation of SVM. In terms of IoT, the Arduino and MCU (Tx and Rx) nodes are exploited for transferring the resulting biosignal remotely as a server and client via the HTTP protocol. Promising experimental results are achieved by conducting experiments on 40 individuals who participated in controlling their emotional biosignals on several devices such as closing and opening a door and also turning the alarm on or off through Wi-Fi.

Its capability to create immersive interactions allows AR to improve the way smart devices are controlled via more direct visual feedback.

The goal of the study is to development of the main points for information technology of automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles. The tasks to be solved are: the structural diagram of the preparatory stage of information technology for automated detection and identification of stationary objects is constructed; the structural diagram of the basic, additional and final stages of information technology automated detection and identification of fixed objects is constructed. General scientific and special methods of scientific knowledge are used. One of the most effective approaches to the recognition and identification of objects is an approach based on the use of deep learning methods. A new model of UAV motion is proposed based on image recognition methods. The methods of pattern recognition with application of neural networks are considered in detail in this work too. The following results are obtained. The developed information technology is implemented in four stages: preparatory, basic, additional and final. Each stage consists of separate procedures aimed at collecting, processing, storing and transmitting information during the flight UAV. Conclusions. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles is based on the knowledge-oriented representation of the stages of image processing of objects on digital aerial photographs on board the UAV. This allows to provide intelligent real-time data processing, changing UAV flight routes depending on the objects detected to improve the effectiveness of the search tasks. Further development of this information technology lies in the development of automated methods of planning UAV routes, automatic change of route parameters in flight processes (performance of a flight task), based on knowledge-oriented technologies. Information technology for the automated detection and identification of stationary objects by unmanned aerial vehicles can become an element of intelligent decision support systems for the use of UAVs (teams of UAVs) to search for both stationary and dynamic objects.Предметом вивчення в статті є процес розробки інформаційної технології автоматизованого виявлення та ідентифікації стаціонарних об'єктів безпілотними літальними апаратами.

477988045,2020-03-04T00:00:00,"[EN] Cultivated rocket (Eruca vesicaria) is a leafy vegetable highly appreciated for its healthpromoting virtues and consumed both raw and cooked as ready-to-use vegetable. Despite Eruca being cultivated worldwide, only a few cultivars are available and limited breeding activities have been carried out so far. Therefore, the genetic resources available represent an unexploited potential source of variation for breeding. In the present study, 155 E. vesicaria accessions from 30 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and America have been characterized for 54 qualitative and quantitative morphological and quality
traits. Conventional descriptors and automated tools for the determination of the quality, morphology, and colour of leaves have been used. Genetic diversity was assessed using 15 inter simple sequence repeat and simple sequence repeat markers. A high level of diversity was evidenced in the collection. Significant
differences were found in most of the traits with the exception of five pseudo-qualitative descriptors. The first and second dimensions of the principal components analysis with phenotypic traits accounted for 25.69% of total variation showing a stratification of the genotypes according to the European and Asian origins. In total, 75% of the variation was contained in
the first 15 components having eigenvalues higher than 1.0. Also, the population structure divided the collection into two main clusters separating European genotypes from the rest. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed a geographical separation,
grouping the accessions into three major clusters, which were differentiated by plant architecture, leaf and flower colour, leaf water status, leaf blade shape and hairiness of the leaves and stem. Our approach has broadened the knowledge of the diversity within the Eruca gene pool, thus contributing to identify sources
of variation and to select the best candidates for cultivated rocket breeding programs, as well as to determine the genetic basis of plant and leaf traits in future genome-wide association studies.The work was supported by 'RGV-FAO' project funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.

362220848,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Introduction - Theoretically, 3D acquisition systems such as terrestrial LiDAR technology could allow capturing tree shapes at high throughput with a high precision. However, in practice, the quality of the canopy reconstruction from data acquired in the field largely depends on the weather conditions, shape of the trees and on the position and number of scans collected. In a previous study, a HT protocol using T-LIDAR technology was developed for characterising simple architectural traits at the tree scale (volume, light interception efficiency) on a large population of apple trees (Coupel-Ledru et al., 2019). Nevertheless, LIDAR point clouds generated with this HT protocol were highly noisy, limiting thus the ability to identify all individual organs within the canopy. Machine and deep learning methods seems an interesting solution as they are capable to adapt to various types of noise by learning directly from training data. As a first case of study, we aimed to automatically detect apples within apple tree point clouds. For this, we developed two automatic pipelines based on machine and deep learning methods that were applied to tree point clouds acquired from LiDAR technology or simulated from synthetic data. Materials and Methods - Our study was carried out on 281, 3 and 4-years-old, apple trees scanned in 2018 and 2019 with terrestrial LiDAR using two specific acquisition protocols. The first one, called LowRes (described in Coupel-Ledru et al., 2019) consisted in taking a scan in the middle of the row every 5 trees, in the different rows of the orchard. With this protocol applied during 1 week, 250 trees with apples were scanned. A second protocol, called HiRes, consisted in scanning more precisely 31 trees: each being scanned from both sides. For the validation, mean and total weight of apple of each tree were measured allowing to estimate the number of apples. Additionally, synthetic data were generated by simulating LiDAR scans on 239 virtual apple trees from their 4 cardinal sides with the MAppleT model (Costes et al., 2008) and the PlantGL software (Pradal et al., 2009). Our training dataset was composed of 10 point clouds of apple trees, in which points were manually labeled into two classes (unknown or apple). It was complemented by a training dataset of 100 synthetic point clouds of simulated apple trees automatically labeled. The first pipeline based on machine learning includes three steps. First, points are characterized with Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH) (Rusu et al., 2009). Second, based on the computed FPFH features and reflectance information from the LiDAR, a random forest model was trained to predict the class of each point. Third, points are clustered into individual apples using the DBSCAN algorithm. The second pipeline merge the two first steps by classifying points directly from their position and reflectance information using a deep learning model based on PointNet (Qi et al., 2017). Finally pipeline performance was assessed by comparing the number of apple point clusters detected in each tree to the number of apples estimated during harvest. Results and Discussion - The random forest model currently showed the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.76 at test stage. Using the same configuration, the PointNet based model performed worse with an accuracy of 0.60, certainly due to the limited size of the training data. Using the random forest model, the pipeline predicted the number of apples per tree on synthetic data with a high accuracy (linear regression coefficient c=1.03 and r²=0.79). The accuracy was lower when applied on apple trees scanned with the HiRes protocol (c=2.18 and r²=0.51) and even lower with the LowRes protocol (c=2.16 and r²=0.23). A strong effect of the LIDAR position relative to the tree and consequently of the point cloud resolution was observed. Indeed, for the trees closest to the scan positions with LowRes protocol (i.e .for a distance tree-LIDAR nearly equivalent to HiRes protocol), the prediction was more reliable (c=2.16 and r²=0.45) than for the farest trees from the scan positions (c=2.08 and r²=0.07). Conclusion - We compared two phenotyping pipelines based on machine and deep learning approaches and applied them to evaluate and virtually experience LiDAR acquisition protocols in order to improve the quality of canopy reconstruction and organ detection. Our results suggest that a tradeoff between scan resolution and accuracy of organ detection has to be considered in future protocols, depending on the objectives. This tradeoff may depend on the tree age and training systems. With limited ground truth data, our experience shows better results with machine learning approach. However, results of the deep learning model can certainly be improved with more realistic geometric models and scanning noise for the synthetic data and/or with a larger amount of annotated data from real scans",Institute of Horticultural Production Systems,Machine and deep learning based identification of organs within LiDAR scans of tree canopies: Application to the estimation of apple production,,http://agritrop.cirad.fr/597184/7/ID597184.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources, and to represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, the current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multi-tier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs which is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge was developed, which integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysing, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learnt and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices.

344885219,2020-03-25T00:00:00,"International audienceWe present a deep learning-based multitask framework for joint 3D human pose estimation and action recognition from RGB sensors using simple cameras. The approach proceeds along two stages. In the first, a real-time 2D pose detector is run to determine the precise pixel location of important keypoints of the human body. A two-stream deep neural network is then designed and trained to map detected 2D keypoints into 3D poses. In the second stage, the Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) algorithm is deployed to find an optimal network architecture that is used for modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of the estimated 3D poses via an image-based intermediate representation and performing action recognition. Experiments on Human3.6M, MSR Action3D and SBU Kinect Interaction datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the targeted tasks. Moreover, we show that the method requires a low computational budget for training and inference.

Specifically, the application shows as the bacteria having associated the most significant microbial impact may not be the most abundant. This offers the potential for integrated management strategies to promote favourable microbial conditions to help safeguard drinking water quality.The research reported here was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), EPSRC-LWEC Challenge Fellowship EP/N02950X/1.

429121482,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Background and objective: As Computed Tomography scans are an essential medical test, many techniques have been proposed to reconstruct high-quality images using a smaller amount of radiation. One approach is to employ algebraic factorization methods to reconstruct the images, using fewer views than the traditional analytical methods. However, their main drawback is the high computational cost and hence the time needed to obtain the images, which is critical in the daily clinical practice. For this reason, faster methods for solving this problem are required.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the QR factorization that is very efficient on affordable equipment (standard multicore processors and standard Solid-State Drives) by using Out-Of-Core techniques.

Results: Combining both affordable hardware and the new software proposed in our work, the images can be reconstructed very quickly and with high quality. We analyze the reconstructions using real Computed Tomography images selected from a dataset, comparing the QR method to the LSQR and FBP. We measure the quality of the images using the metrics Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, obtaining very high values. We also compare the efficiency of using spinning disks versus Solid-State Drives, showing how the latter performs the Input/Output operations in a significantly lower amount of time. Conclusions: The results indicate that our proposed me thod and software are valid to efficiently solve large-scale systems and can be applied to the Computed Tomography reconstruction problem to obtain high-quality images.This research has been supported by ""Universitat Politecnica de Valencia"", ""Generalitat Valenciana"" under PROMETEO/2018/035 and ACIF/2017/075, co-financed by FEDER and FSE funds, and the ""Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities"" under Grant RTI2018-098156-B-C54 co-financed by FEDER funds.Chillarón-Pérez, M.; Quintana Ortí, G.; Vidal-Gimeno, V.; Verdú Martín, GJ.

The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R). The work of Patricia Pons is supported by a national grant from the Spanish MECD (FPU13/03831). Special thanks are due to the children and teachers of the Col-legi Public Vicente Gaos for their valuable collaboration and dedication.Pons Tomás, P.; Jaén Martínez, FJ. (2020).

426867658,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments",'MDPI AG',BCNDataset: Description and Analysis of an Annotated Night Urban Leisure Sound Dataset,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
287866167,2020-12-01T00:00:00,"A video game is an interactive software able to arouse intense emotions in players. Consequentially, different theories have been proposed to understand which game aspects are able to affect the players\u2019 emotional state. However, only few works have tried to use empirical evidence to investigate the effects of different game aspects of the players\u2019 emotions. In this paper, we present the results of a set of experiments aimed at predicting the players\u2019 emotions during video games sessions using their physiological data. We have created a physiological dataset from the data acquired by 33 participants during video game fruition using a standard monitor and a Virtual Reality headset. The dataset contains information about electrocardiogram, 5 facials electromyographies, electrodermal activity, and respiration. Furthermore, we have asked the players to self-assess their emotional state on the Arousal and Valence space. We have then analyzed the contribution of each physiological signal to the overall definition of the players\u2019 mental state. Finally, we have applied Machine Learning techniques to predict the emotional state of players during game sessions at a precision of one second. The obtained results can contribute to define game devices and engines able to detect physiological data, as well to improve the game design process",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An empirical study of players&#8217; emotions in VR racing games based on a dataset of physiological data,10.1007/s11042-019-08585-y,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
426057424,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Clinical trials in cancer treatment are imperative in enhancing patients\u2019 survival and quality of life outcomes. The lack of communication among professionals may produce a non-optimization of patients\u2019 accrual in clinical trials. We developed a specific platform, called \u201cDigital Research Assistant\u201d (DRA), to report real-time every available clinical trial and support clinician. Healthcare professionals involved in breast cancer working group agreed nine minimal fields of interest to preliminarily classify the characteristics of patients\u2019 records (including omic data, such as genomic mutations). A progressive web app (PWA) was developed to implement a cross-platform software that was scalable on several electronic devices to share the patients\u2019 records and clinical trials. A specialist is able to use and populate the platform. An AI algorithm helps in the matchmaking between patient\u2019s data and clinical trial\u2019s inclusion criteria to personalize patient enrollment.

483665146,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An image is worth a thousand words; hence, a face image illustrates extensive details about the speciﬁcation, gender, age, and emotional states of mind. Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human–computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one ﬁnds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The ﬁrst branch explores geo-metric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the ﬁnal classiﬁca-tion score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on ﬁve benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The data-bases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. The proposed method is compared with existing approaches using four evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

The purpose of this case study was to provide insight into the lived reality of using the assistive robotic exoskeleton ReWalk.Method: We used ethnographic techniques to explore the everyday experience and use of the assistive robotic device.Results: We found that the appropriation and integration of the technology within the patient's everyday lives required a social and collaborative effort, which continued into use. The decisions to utilise the technology (or not) was closely tied to physical, social, cultural, environmental, and psychological factors. Consequently, there was much variation in patients' perception of the technology and opportunities for support. Four themes emerged:(a) Meaning of mobility—physical mobility represents more than functional ability. Its present socio-cultural meaning is associated with an individual's self-identity and life priorities.(b) Accomplishing body-technique—integration with the body requires a long process of skill acquisition and re-embodiment.(c) Adaptation and adjustment in use—successful use of the technology was characterised by ongoing adjustment and adaptation of the technology and ways of using it.(d) Human element—introduction and sustained use of the exoskeleton demand a social and collaborative effort across the user's professional and lay resources.Conclusions: This study highlights that the development and implementation of the technology need to be grounded in a deep understanding of the day-to-day lives and experiences of the people that use them",'Frontiers Media SA',Living With Assistive Robotics: Exploring the Everyday Use of Exoskeleton for Persons With Spinal Cord Injury,10.3389/fmedt.2021.747632,,"[{'title': 'Frontiers in Medical Technology', 'identifiers': ['issn:2673-3129', '2673-3129']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, during a time-out, surgical participants are unable to review the patient's charts due to their aseptic hands. To improve the conditions in surgical time-outs, we introduce a deep learning-based smart speaker to confirm the surgical information prior to cataract surgeries. This pilot study utilized the publicly available audio vocabulary dataset and recorded audio data published by the authors. The audio clips of the target words, such as left, right, cataract, phacoemulsification, and intraocular lens, were selected to determine and confirm surgical information in the time-out speech. A deep convolutional neural network model was trained and implemented in the smart speaker that was developed using a mini development board and commercial speakerphone. To validate our model in the consecutive speeches during time-outs, we generated 200 time-out speeches for cataract surgeries by randomly selecting the surgical statuses of the surgical participants. After the training process, the deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% for the validation dataset of short-word audio clips. Our deep learning-based smart speaker achieved an accuracy of 93.5% for the 200 time-out speeches. The surgical and procedural accuracy was 100%. Additionally, on validating the deep learning model by using web-generated time-out speeches and video clips for general surgery, the model exhibited a robust and good performance. In this pilot study, the proposed deep learning-based smart speaker was able to successfully confirm the surgical information during the time-out speech.

479728835,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm.

As a result, CARAMEL enhances the protection against threats related to automated driving, smart charging of Electric Vehicles, and communication among vehicles or between vehicles and the roadside infrastructure. This work focuses on the latter and presents the CARAMEL architecture aiming at assessing the integrity of the information transmitted by vehicles, as well as at improving the security and privacy of communication for connected and autonomous driving. The proposed architecture includes: (1) multi-radio access technology capabilities, with simultaneous 802.11p and LTE-Uu support, enabled by the connectivity infrastructure; (2) a MEC platform, where, among others, algorithms for detecting attacks are implemented; (3) an intelligent On-Board Unit with anti-hacking features inside the vehicle; (4) a Public Key Infrastructure that validates in real-time the integrity of vehicle’s data transmissions. As an indicative application, the interaction between the entities of the CARAMEL architecture is showcased in case of a GPS spoofing attack scenario.

It affects the patient in life’s major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, and the usual treatment is performed with the help of anti- psychotic medication, which targets primarily the hallucinations, delirium, etc. Other symptoms, such as the decreased emotional expression or avolition, require a multidisciplinary approach, including psychopharmacology, cognitive training, and many forms of therapy. In this context, this paper addresses the use of digital technologies to design and develop innovative rehabilitation techniques, particularly focusing on mental health rehabilitation, and contributing for the promotion of well-being and health from a holistic perspective. In this context, serious games and virtual reality allows for creation of immersive environments that contribute to a more effective and lasting recovery, with improvements in terms of quality of life. The use of machine learning techniques will allow the real-time analysis of the data collected during the execution of the rehabilitation procedures, as well as enable their dynamic and automatic adaptation according to the profile and performance of the patients, by increasing or reducing the exercises’ difficulty. It relies on the acquisition of biometric and physiological signals, such as voice, heart rate, and game performance, to estimate the stress level, thus adapting the difficulty of the experience to the skills of the patient. The system described in this paper is currently in development, in collaboration with a health unit, and is an engineering effort that combines hardware and software to develop a rehabilitation tool for schizophrenic patients.

The obtained algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the (unseen) test sequences. The obtained performances are achieved thanks to a well-chosen model, a proper loss function for orientation increments, and through the identification of key points when training with high-frequency inertial data. Our approach builds upon a neural network based on dilated convolutions, without requiring any recurrent neural network. We demonstrate how efficient our strategy is for 3D attitude estimation on the EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets. Interestingly, we observe our dead reckoning algorithm manages to beat top-ranked visual-inertial odometry systems in terms of attitude estimation although it does not use vision sensors.

Many edge applications, such as multi-player augmented reality (AR) gaming and federated machine learning, require that distributed clients work collaboratively for a common goal through message exchanges. Given an edge network, it is an open problem how to deploy such collaborative edge applications to achieve the best overall system performance. This paper presents a formal study of this problem. We first provide a mix of cost models to capture the system. Based on a thorough formulation, we propose an iterative algorithm dubbed ITEM, where in each iteration, we construct a graph to encode all the costs and convert the cost optimization problem into a graph cut problem. By obtaining the minimum s-t cut via existing max-flow algorithms, we address the original problem via solving a series of graph cuts. We rigorously prove that ITEM has a parameterized constant approximation ratio. Inspired by the optimal stopping theory, we further design an online algorithm called OPTS, based on optimally alternating between partial and full placement updates. Our evaluations with real-world data traces demonstrate that ITEM performs close to the optimum (within 5%) and converges fast.

For this, Big Data technologies for smart processing of massive data streams are available, but the facilities they offer are often too raw to be effectively exploited by analysts. RAM3S (Realtime Analysis of Massive MultiMedia Streams) is a framework that acts as a middleware software layer between multimedia stream analysis techniques and Big Data streaming platforms, so as to facilitate the implementation of the former on top of the latter. RAM3S has been proven helpful in simplifying the deployment of non-parallel techniques to streaming platforms, such as Apache Storm or Apache Flink. In this paper, we show how RAM3S has been updated to incorporate novel stream processing platforms, such as Apache Samza, and to be able to communicate with different message brokers, such as Apache Kafka. Abstracting from the message broker also provides us with the ability to pipeline several RAM3S instances that can, therefore, perform different processing tasks. This represents a richer model for stream analysis with respect to the one already available in the original RAM3S version. The generality of this new RAM3S version is demonstrated through experiments conducted on three different multimedia applications, proving that RAM3S is a formidable asset for enabling efﬁcient and effective Data Mining and Machine Learning on multimedia data streams.openIlaria Bartolini; Marco PatellaIlaria Bartolini; Marco Patell",'MDPI AG',The Metamorphosis (of RAM3S),10.3390/app112411584,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Real-time intelligent video processing on embedded devices with low power consumption can be useful for applications like drone surveillance, smart cars, and more. However, the limited resources of embedded devices is a challenging issue for effective embedded computing. Most of the existing work on this topic focuses on single device based solutions, without the use of cloud computing mechanisms for parallel processing to boost performance. In this paper, we propose a cloud platform for real-time video processing based on embedded devices. Eight NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and three Jetson TX2 GPUs are used to construct a streaming embedded cloud platform (SECP), on which Apache Storm is deployed as the cloud computing environment for deep learning algorithms (Convolutional Neural Networks — CNNs) to process video streams. Additionally, self-managing services are designed to ensure that this platform can run smoothly and stably, in the form of a metric sensor, a bottleneck detector and a scheduler. This platform is evaluated in terms of processing speed, power consumption, and network throughput by running various deep learning algorithms for object detection. The results show the proposed platform can run deep learning algorithms on embedded devices while meeting the high scalability and fault tolerance required for real-time video processing",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',A streaming cloud platform for real-time video processing on embedded devices,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, the contribution of gesture recognition and pose estimation to the smooth introduction of cobots into an industrial assembly line is described, with a view to performing actions in parallel with the human operators and enabling interaction between them. The proposed active vision system uses two RGB-D cameras that record different points of view of gestures and poses of the operator, to build an external perception layer for the robot that facilitates spatiotemporal adaptation, in accordance with the human's behavior. The use-case of this work is concerned with LCD TV assembly of an appliance manufacturer, comprising of two parts. The first part of the above-mentioned operation is assigned to a robot, strengthening the assembly line. The second part is assigned to a human operator. Gesture recognition, pose estimation, physical interaction, and sonic notification, create a multimodal human-robot interaction system. Five experiments are performed, to test if gesture recognition and pose estimation can reduce the cycle time and range of motion of the operator, respectively. Physical interaction is achieved using the force sensor of the cobot. Pose estimation through a skeleton-tracking algorithm provides the cobot with human pose information and makes it spatially adjustable. Sonic notification is added for the case of unexpected incidents. A real-time gesture recognition module is implemented through a Deep Learning architecture consisting of Convolutional layers, trained in an egocentric view and reducing the cycle time of the routine by almost 20%. This constitutes an added value in this work, as it affords the potential of recognizing gestures independently of the anthropometric characteristics and the background. Common metrics derived from the literature are used for the evaluation of the proposed system. The percentage of spatial adaptation of the cobot is proposed as a new KPI for a collaborative system and the opinion of the human operator is measured through a questionnaire that concerns the various affective states of the operator during the collaboration",'Frontiers Media SA',Egocentric Gesture Recognition Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for the Spatiotemporal Adaptation of Collaborative Robots,10.3389/fnbot.2021.703545,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

429956590,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website.

Our system presents periodical visual stimuli to the patient's field of view and analyses the consequent evoked brain potentials elicited in the occipital lobe and recorded through EEG. The analysis of the monitored EEG data is performed in an end-to-end fashion by a convolutional neural network (CNN). We propose a novel CNN architecture for EEG signal analysis that can be trained utilizing the benefits of multi-task learning. The closedloop attribute of our system allows for a real-time adaptation of the subsequent stimuli to further examine a potentially damaged area or increase the granularity of the exploration. Interchangeability is provided in terms of software modules, stimulus type, visual hardware, EEG acquisition device and EEG electrodes.

The paper was created on the basis of secondary sources of information (desk research). The entire publication concerns the emerging opportunities for the development of the steel producers to Industry 4.0 and the changes already implemented in the steel plants. The collected information shows the support environment for changes in the steel sector (EU programs), the levels of evolution of steel mills, along with the areas of change in the steel industry and implemented investment projects. The work consists of a theoretical part based on a literature review and a practical part based on case studies. The work ends with a discussion in which the staged and segmented nature of the changes introduced in the analyzed sector is emphasized. Based on the three case studies described in the paper, a comparative analysis was conducted between them. When we tried to compare methods used in the three analyzed steel producers (capital groups): ArcelorMittal, Thyssenkrupp, and Tata Steel Group, it can be seen that in all organizations, the main problem connected with steelworks 4.0 transition is the digitalization of all processes within an organization and in the entire supply chain. This is realized using various tools and methods but they are concentrated on using technologies and methods such as artificial intelligence, drones, virtual reality, full automatization, and industrial robots. The effects are connected to better relations with customers, which leads to an increase in customer satisfaction and the organizations’ profit. The steel industry will undergo further strong changes, bringing it closer to Industry 4.0 because it occupies an important place in the economies of many countries due to the strong dependence of steel producers on the markets of the recipients (steel consumers).

The level of attention indicates how intense the focus is on an object or an instance. In this study, several types of human attention level have been observed. After introducing image segmentation and detection technique for facial features, eyeball movement and gaze estimation were measured. Eye movement were assessed using the video data, and a total of 10197 data instances were manually labelled for the attention level. Then Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep learning (DL) architectures have been proposed for analysing the data. Next, the trained DL model has been implanted into a robotic system that is capable of detecting various features; ultimately leading to the calculation of visual attention for reading, browsing, and writing purposes. This system is capable of checking the attention level of the participants and also can detect if participants are present or not.

479365133,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The ability to estimate radio coverage accurately is fundamental for planning and optimizing any wireless network, notably when a new generation, as the 5th Generation (5G), is in an early deployment phase. The knowledge acquired from radio planning of previous generations must be revisited, particularly the used path loss and antennas models, as the 5G propagation is intrinsically distinct. This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements. After calibration, the MAE for LoS and NLoS decreased to 5.45 dB and 7.51 dB, respectively. Moreover, the non-calibrated 3GPP path loss model led to overestimations of the 5G coverage and user throughput up to 25&#x0025; and 163&#x0025;, respectively, when compared to the calibrated model predictions. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms resulted in path loss MAEs within the range of 4.58 dB to 5.38 dB, for LoS, and within the range of 3.70 dB to 5.96 dB, for NLoS, with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm attaining the lowest error",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Analysis and Optimization of 5G Coverage Predictions Using a Beamforming Antenna Model and Real Drive Test Measurements,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097633,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
326520478,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The “time-varying loudness (TVL)” model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) calculates “instantaneous loudness” every 1 ms, and this is used to generate predictions of short-term loudness, the loudness of a short segment of sound, such as a word in a sentence, and of long-term loudness, the loudness of a longer segment of sound, such as a whole sentence. The calculation of instantaneous loudness is computationally intensive and real-time implementation of the TVL model is difficult. To speed up the computation, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict instantaneous loudness using a large database of speech sounds and artificial sounds (tones alone and tones in white or pink noise), with the predictions of the TVL model as a reference (providing the ""correct"" answer, specifically the loudness level in phons). A multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers was found to be sufficient, with more complex DNN architecture not yielding higher accuracy. After training, the deviations between the predictions of the TVL model and the predictions of the DNN were typically less than 0.5 phons, even for types of sounds that were not used for training (music, rain, animal sounds, washing machine).

477989381,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls is one of most concerning accidents in aged population due to its high frequency and serious repercussion; thus, quick assistance is critical to avoid serious health consequences. There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement.This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program as part of the ACTIVAGE project under Grant 732679.Sarabia-Jácome, D.; Usach, R.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

The development of modern neural network IT gives rise to a number of urgent tasks at the junction of several scientific disciplines. One of them is to create a hardware platform – a neuroprocessor for energy-efficient operation of neural networks. Recently, the development of nanotechnology of the main units of the neuroprocessor relies on combined memristor super-large logical and storage matrices. The matrix topology is built on the principle of maximum integration of programmable links between nodes. This article describes a method for implementing biomorphic neural functionality based on programmable links of a highly integrated 3D logic matrix. This paper focuses on the problem of achieving energy efficiency of the hardware used to model neural networks. The main part analyzes the known facts of the principles of information transfer and processing in biological systems from the point of view of their implementation in the input unit of the neuroprocessor. The author deals with the scheme of an electronic neuron implemented based on elements of a 3D logical matrix. A pulsed method of encoding input information is presented, which most realistically reflects the principle of operation of a sensory biological neural system. The model of an electronic neuron for selecting ranges of technological parameters in a real 3D logic matrix scheme is analyzed. The implementation of disjunctively normal forms is shown, using the logic function in the input unit of a neuroprocessor as an example. The results of modeling fragments of electric circuits with memristors of a 3D logical matrix in programming mode are presented. The author concludes that biomorphic pulse coding of standard digital signals allows achieving a high degree of energy efficiency of the logic elements of the neuroprocessor by reducing the number of valve operations.

490592519,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods &amp; Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of &gt; 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",'PGDesign / Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,,https://core.ac.uk/download/490592519.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such systems can be useful to evaluate the catch composition as well. In demersal trawl fisheries, however, their applicability can be challenged by low light conditions, mobilized sediment and scattering in murky waters. In this study, we introduce a novel observation system (called NepCon) which aims at reducing current limitations by combining an optimized image acquisition setup and tailored image analyses software. The NepCon system includes a high-contrast background to enhance the visibility of the target objects, a compact camera and an artificial light source. The image analysis software includes a machine learning algorithm which is evaluated here to test automatic detection and count of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). NepCon is specifically designed for applications in demersal trawls and this first phase aims at increasing the accuracy of N. norvegicus detection at the data acquisition level. To find the best contrasting background for the purpose we compared the output of four image segmentation methods applied to static images of N. norvegicus fixed in front of four test background colors. The background color with the best performance was then used to evaluate computer vision and deep learning approaches for automatic detection, tracking and counting of N. norvegicus in the videos. In this initial phase we tested the system in an experimental setting to understand the feasibility of the system for future implementation in real demersal fishing conditions. The N. norvegicus directed trawl fishery typically has no assistance from underwater observation technology and therefore are largely conducted blindly.

Deep learning modules enable robots to accompany a person by detecting the target, learning the target and following while avoiding collision within the dynamic home environment. The variational Bayesian techniques robustly predict the trajectory of the target by empowering the following ability of the robot when target is lost.

Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients with a mean age 25.1 of years were included in this study. In 33 patients a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and in seven patients a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed. A total of 60 patients were treated by a bimaxillary approach. Onyx Ceph (R) was used as cephalometric planning software (Onyx Ceph (R)), followed by mock operations. Postoperative cephalograms were obtained after 3.3 days and compared to preoperative planning cephalograms for sagittal (SNA, SNB, ANB) and vertical (ArGoMe, ML-NSL, NL-NSL) angle measurements. Real and absolute mean deviation were documented. Results: Absolute mean deviation (degrees) between postoperative and planned jaw movement was lower for the sagittal parameters SNA (0.58), SNB (1.15) and ANB (1.05) compared to the vertical parameters NL-NSL (1.47), ML-NSL (1.96) and ArGoMe (3.20). SNA, SNB and ANB showed constant deviations independent from the extent of jaw movement. With regard to the vertical parameters ML-NSL, ArGoMe and NL-NSL the extent of the postoperative rotational jaw movement was not as much as planned, particularly for vertical shifts of more than 4 degrees. Conclusion: By using the 2D Onyx Ceph (R) cephalometric software for orthognathic surgery, the deviations between planned and actual movements are within an acceptable and predictable range.

217873301,2018-09-01T00:00:00,"International audienceModern surface acquisition devices, such as interferometers and confocal microscopes, make it possible to have accurate three-dimensional (3D) numerical representations of real surfaces. The numerical dental surfaces hold details that are related to the microwear that is caused by food processing. As there are numerous surface parameters that describe surface properties and knowing that a lot more can be built, is it possible to identify the ones that can separate taxa based on their diets? Until now, the candidates were chosen from among those provided by metrology software, which often implements International Organization for Standardization (ISO) parameters. Moreover, the way that a parameter is declared as diet-discriminative differs from one researcher to another. The aim of the present work is to propose a framework to broaden the investigation of relevant parameters and subsequently a procedure that is based on statistical tests to highlight the best of them. Many parameters were tested in a previous study. Here, some were dropped and others added to the classical ones. The resulting set is doubled while considering two derived surfaces: the initial one minus a second order and an eighth order polynomial. The resulting surfaces are then sampled—256 samples per surface—making it possible to build new derived parameters that are based on statistics. The studied dental surfaces belong to seven sets of three or more groups with known differences in diet. In almost all cases, the statistical procedure succeeds in identifying the most relevant parameters to reflect the group differences. Surprisingly, the widely used Area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc) parameter—despite some improvements—cannot differentiate the groups as accurately. The present work can be used as a standalone procedure, but it can also be seen as a first step towards machine learning where a lot of training data is necessary, thus making the human intervention prohibitive",'MDPI AG',Gathering and Analyzing Surface Parameters for Diet Identification Purposes,https://core.ac.uk/download/217873301.pdf,,10.3390/technologies6030075,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However,  state-of-the-art  deep  learning methods are known to produce erratic or unsafe predictions when faced with novel inputs. Furthermore, recent ensemble, bootstrap and dropout methods for quantifying neural network uncertainty may not efficiently provide accurate uncertainty estimates when queried  with  inputs  that  are  very  different  from  their  training data.

Motion-blurred images are the result of an averaging process, where instant frames are accumulated over time during the exposure of the sensor. Unfortunately, reversing this process is nontrivial. Firstly, averaging destroys the temporal ordering of the frames. Secondly, the recovery of a single frame is a blind deconvolution task, which is highly ill-posed. We present a deep learning scheme that gradually reconstructs a temporal ordering by sequentially extracting pairs of frames. Our main contribution is to introduce loss functions invariant to the temporal order. This lets a neural network choose during training what frame to output among the possible combinations. We also address the ill-posedness of deblurring by designing a network with a large receptive field and implemented via resampling to achieve a higher computational efficiency.

251215068,2019-08-01T00:00:00,"PURPOSE: The use of neural networks to directly predict three-dimensional dose distributions for automatic planning is becoming popular. However, the existing methods use only patient anatomy as input and assume consistent beam configuration for all patients in the training database. The purpose of this work was to develop a more general model that considers variable beam configurations in addition to patient anatomy to achieve more comprehensive automatic planning with a potentially easier clinical implementation, without the need to train specific models for different beam settings. METHODS: The proposed anatomy and beam (AB) model is based on our newly developed deep learning architecture, and hierarchically densely connected U-Net (HD U-Net), which combines U-Net and DenseNet. The AB model contains 10 input channels: one for beam setup and the other 9 for anatomical information (PTV and organs). The beam setup information is represented by a 3D matrix of the non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. We used a set of images from 129 patients with lung cancer treated with IMRT with heterogeneous beam configurations (4-9 beams of various orientations) for training/validation (100 patients) and testing (29 patients). Mean squared error was used as the loss function. We evaluated the model's accuracy by comparing the mean dose, maximum dose, and other relevant dose-volume metrics for the predicted dose distribution against those of the clinically delivered dose distribution. Dice similarity coefficients were computed to address the spatial correspondence of the isodose volumes between the predicted and clinically delivered doses. The model was also compared with our previous work, the anatomy only (AO) model, which does not consider beam setup information and uses only 9 channels for anatomical information. RESULTS: The AB model outperformed the AO model, especially in the low and medium dose regions. In terms of dose-volume metrics, AB outperformed AO by about 1-2%. The largest improvement was found to be about 5% in lung volume receiving a dose of 5Gy or more (V5 ). The improvement for spinal cord maximum dose was also important, that is, 3.6% for cross-validation and 2.6% for testing. The AB model achieved Dice scores for isodose volumes as much as 10% higher than the AO model in low and medium dose regions and about 2-5% higher in high dose regions. CONCLUSIONS: The AO model, which does not use beam configuration as input, can still predict dose distributions with reasonable accuracy in high dose regions but introduces large errors in low and medium dose regions for IMRT cases with variable beam numbers and orientations. The proposed AB model outperforms the AO model substantially in low and medium dose regions, and slightly in high dose regions, by considering beam setup information through a cumulative non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. This new model represents a major step forward towards predicting 3D dose distributions in real clinical practices, where beam configuration could vary from patient to patient, from planner to planner, and from institution to institution.status: publishe",'Wiley',Three-dimensional dose prediction for lung IMRT patients with deep neural networks: robust learning from heterogeneous beam configurations,,"[{'title': 'Medical Physics', 'identifiers': ['issn:0094-2405', 'issn:2473-4209', '0094-2405', '2473-4209']}]",10.1002/mp.13597,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditionally, gaze tracking approaches to action recognition have relied upon computer vision-based analyses of two-dimensional egocentric camera videos. The objective of this study was to identify useful features that can be extracted from three-dimensional (3D) gaze behavior and used as inputs to machine learning algorithms for human action recognition. We investigated human gaze behavior and gaze-object interactions in 3D during the performance of a bimanual, instrumental activity of daily living: the preparation of a powdered drink. A marker-based motion capture system and binocular eye tracker were used to reconstruct 3D gaze vectors and their intersection with 3D point clouds of objects being manipulated. Statistical analyses of gaze fixation duration and saccade size suggested that some actions (pouring and stirring) may require more visual attention than other actions (reach, pick up, set down, and move). 3D gaze saliency maps, generated with high spatial resolution for six subtasks, appeared to encode action-relevant information. The ""gaze object sequence"" was used to capture information about the identity of objects in concert with the temporal sequence in which the objects were visually regarded. Dynamic time warping barycentric averaging was used to create a population-based set of characteristic gaze object sequences that accounted for intra- and inter-subject variability. The gaze object sequence was used to demonstrate the feasibility of a simple action recognition algorithm that utilized a dynamic time warping Euclidean distance metric. Averaged over the six subtasks, the action recognition algorithm yielded an accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 89.5%, and recall of 89.2%. This level of performance suggests that the gaze object sequence is a promising feature for action recognition whose impact could be enhanced through the use of sophisticated machine learning classifiers and algorithmic improvements for real-time implementation.

268992296,2019-07-01,"Multimedia sensors enable monitoring applications to obtain more accurate and detailed information. However, the development of efficient and lightweight solutions for managing data traffic over wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) has become vital because of the excessive volume of data produced by multimedia sensors. As part of this motivation, this paper proposes a fusion-based WMSN framework that reduces the amount of data to be transmitted over the network by intra-node processing. This framework explores three main issues: 1) the design of a wireless multimedia sensor (WMS) node to detect objects using machine learning techniques; 2) a method for increasing the accuracy while reducing the amount of information transmitted by the WMS nodes to the base station, and; 3) a new cluster-based routing algorithm for the WMSNs that consumes less power than the currently used algorithms. In this context, a WMS node is designed and implemented using commercially available components. In order to reduce the amount of information to be transmitted to the base station and thereby extend the lifetime of a WMSN, a method for detecting and classifying objects on three different layers has been developed. A new energy-efficient cluster-based routing algorithm is developed to transfer the collected information/data to the sink. The proposed framework and the cluster-based routing algorithm are applied to our WMS nodes and tested experimentally.

225251678,,"[[abstract]]In this research, we propose a state-of-the-art 3D finger gesture tracking and recognition method. We use the depth sensors for both hands in real time music playing. In line with the development of 3D depth cameras, we implemented a set of 3D gesture-based instruments, such as Virtual Cello and Virtual Piano, which need precise finger tracking in 3D space. For hands tracking, model-based tracking for left hand and appearance-based tracking for right hand techniques are proposed. To detect finger gestures, our approaches consist number of systematic steps as reducing noise in depth map and geometrical processing for Virtual Cello. For Virtual Piano, we introduce the Neural Network (NN) method to detect special hand gestures. It has Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure with back propagation training. Literature has few examples using touch screen as medium, with fixed-coordinates, and 2D–gestures to control MIDI input. The end users should no longer carry anything on their hands. We use Senz3D and Leap Motion due to a few technical benefits. Senz3D and Leap Motion use a closer distance to hands, thus detailed finger gestures can be precisely identified.

160467102,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Background/Aims: Apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The impact of aTRH and achievement of recommended blood pressure (BP) values on the rate of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss in CKD patients is poorly known. To assess the role of aTRH and time-updated BP control (BPC) on the progression of CKD in patients with T2D and hypertension (HT) in real life clinical practice. Methods: Clinical records from a total of 2,778 diabetic patients with HT and stage 3 CKD (i.e. baseline eGFR values between 30 and 60 ml/min) and regular visits during a four-year follow-up were analyzed. The association between BPC (i.e. 75% of visits with BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) and eGFR loss (i.e. a &gt;30% reduction from baseline) or worsening of albuminuria status over time was assessed. Results: At baseline 33% of patients had aTRH. Over the 4-year follow-up, 20% had a &gt;30% eGFR reduction. Patients with aTRH had an increased risk of eGFR loss &gt;30% (OR 1.31; P&lt;0.007). In patients with aTRH, BPC was associated with a 79% (P=0.029) greater risk of eGFR reduction despite a 58% (P=0.001) lower risk of albuminuria status worsening. In non-aTRH, no association was found between BPC and renal outcome. Conclusion: In patients with stage 3 CKD the presence of aTRH entails a faster loss of eGFR. More effective prevention of aTRH should be implemented as this condition is associated with a burden of risk not modifiable by tight BP reduction",'S.

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells. Hence, the IncuCyte system and its NeuroTrack module provide an appealing platform for efficient in vitro studies of antifungal compounds and immunotherapeu-tic strategies in medical mycology.openWurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P.Wurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P",'American Society for Microbiology',"Live monitoring and analysis of fungal growth, viability, and mycelial morphology using the incucyte neurotrack processing module",https://core.ac.uk/download/233571269.pdf,,10.1128/mBio.00673-19,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the lack of an adequate control mechanism in the United Nations system, which would enable the individuals affected by sanctions at least a quasi-judicial review of the decisions adopted by the Sanctions Committee regarding their names being listed on the so called sanctions list, in reality those individuals are faced with violations of their fundamental human rights (e.g. the right to access to court, the right to a fair trial, the right to an effective remedy). The subject of this paper is the analysis of the Security Council’s sanction regime in the fight against terrorism which was introduced in resolution 1267 (1999). The author further analyzes international jurisprudence concerned with the mentioned violations of human rights in the implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council. Special
emphasis is placed on the institution of Ombudsperson and its implications on the sanctions regime. The author concludes with the assessment of the efficacy of the reforms introduced in the sanctions regime as a step forward to the more transparent and effective fight against terrorism.Der Wendepunkt bei der Anwendung von Sanktionen des UN-Sicherheitsrates von an den Staat gerichteten allgemeinen Sanktionen zu den gezielten (klugen) Sanktionen, die direkt und ausschließlich an einzelne mit Terrorismus verbundenen Personen gerichtet sind, hat außer positiven auch negative Auswirkungen verursacht, welche die Gesetzmäßigkeit und Gerechtigkeit von gezielten Sanktionen in Frage

However this is a new problem since we aim to extract the temporal segments of the video where motion saliency is present. It turns out to be a frame-based classification problem. A frame will be classified as dynamically salient if it contains local motion departing from its context. Temporal motion saliency detection is relevant for applications where one needs to trigger alerts or to monitor dynamic behaviours from videos. It can also be viewed as a prerequisite before computing motion saliency maps. The proposed approach handles situations with a mobile camera. It involves two main stages consisting first in cancelling the global motion due to the camera movement, then in applying a deep learning classification framework. We have investigated two ways of implementing the first stage, based on image warping, and on residual flow respectively. Experiments on real videos demonstrate that we can obtain accurate classification in highly challenging situations",'Elsevier BV',CNN-based temporal detection of motion saliency in videos,,,10.1016/j.patrec.2019.09.016,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

288358137,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Two-dimensional (2D) crystals, for which the shape is described by two linear sizes, are common in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Since the crystal size and shape are directly related to the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the simultaneous size and shape distribution control is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical crystallization engineering. To efficiently achieve simultaneous size and shape control often requires model-based control strategies; however, the increased computational cost of the process simulation and the substantial differences between the simulated and measurable quantities make the implementation of model-based control approaches challenging. This paper addresses the important problem of the real-time simulation of the most likely measurable chord length distribution (CLD) and aspect ratio distribution (ARD) as well as the concentration variations during the crystallization of 2D needle-shaped crystals. This enables the application of focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) and particle vision and microscopy (PVM), two routinely applied probes, as quantitative direct feedback control tools. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based FBRM and PVM soft-sensors are developed, which enable the direct and fast transformation of 2D crystal size distribution (CSD) to CLD and ARD on arbitrary 2D grids. The training data for the ANN are generated by a first principle, geometrical model-based simulation of FBRM and PVM for high aspect ratio crystals, although the ANN approach is applicable for any simulated or experimental training data sets. It is also demonstrated that the in situ imaging-based shape measurement underestimates the real aspect ratio (AR) of crystals, for which a simple correction is proposed. From the model-equation solution perspective, the soft-sensors require full population balance solution. The 2D high-resolution finite volume method is applied to simulate the full 2D CSD, which is an accurate, stable, but computationally expensive technique. The real-time applicability is achieved through various implementation improvements including grid optimization and data-type optimized hybrid central processing unit-graphical processing unit calculations",,Aspect ratio distribution and chord length distribution driven modeling of crystallization of two-dimensional crystals for real-time model-based applications,https://core.ac.uk/download/288358137.pdf,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The new implementation, which is coded in C++ and takes advantage of the parallelization functionalities both on CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units), was validated using different benchmark cases and compared, in terms of numerical output and computational efficiency, with other well-known hydraulic software packages. Depending on the complexity of the specific test case, the new parallel implementation can achieve speedups up to two orders of magnitude when compared with the standard version. The speedup is especially remarkable for the GPU parallelization that uses Nvidia CUDA (compute unified device architecture). The efficiency is as good as the one provided by some of the most popular hydraulic models. We also present the application of Iber+ to model an extreme flash flood that took place in the Spanish Pyrenees in October 2012. The new implementation was used to simulate 24 h of real time in roughly eight minutes of computing time, while the standard version needed more than 15 h.

Composing questions in the examination process to measure students’ achievement in the school teaching and learning process can be difficult and time consuming. To solve this problem, this research proposes Automatic Question Generation (AQG) method to generate Open Domain Indonesian Question by using syntactical approach. Open Domain questions are questions covering many domains of knowledge. The challenge of generating the questions is how to identify the types of declarative sentences that are

potential to be transformed into questions and how to develop the method for generating question

automatically. In realizing the method, this research incorporates four stages, namely: the identification of

declarative sentence for 8 coarse-class and 19 fine-class sentences, the classification of features for coarseclass

sentence and the classification rules for fine-class sentence, the identification of question patterns, and the extraction of sentence’s components as well as the rule generation of questions. The coarse-class classification was carried out based on a machine learning with syntactical features of the sentence, namely:

Part of Speech (POS) Tag, the presence of punctuation, the availability of specific verbs, sequence of words, etc. The fine-class classification was carried out based on a set of rules.

In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations.

System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

302833051,2019-05-08T00:00:00,"Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',All-optical spiking neurosynaptic networks with self-learning capabilities,,"[{'title': 'Nature', 'identifiers': ['issn:0028-0836', '0028-0836']}]",10.1038/s41586-019-1157-8,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
345057677,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"In this work, we present a semantic situation awareness system for multirotor aerial robots, based on 2D LIDAR measurements, targeting the understanding of the environment and assuming to have a precise robot localization as an input of our algorithm. Our proposed situation awareness system calculates a semantic map of the objects of the environment as a list of circles represented by their radius, and the position and the velocity of their center in world coordinates. Our proposed algorithm includes three main parts. First, the LIDAR measurements are preprocessed and an object segmentation clusters the candidate objects present in the environment. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been designed and trained using an artificially generated dataset, computes the radius and the position of the center of individual circles in sensor coordinates.

In addition, sorghum cultivation is economically profitable and it does not contain the proteins that affect celiac patients. In the last years, a variety of ""free gluten"" food products were developed for improving the celiac diet, as well as sorghum beers, which are frequently produced in a home-made manner on a very small scale by individual brewers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a non-alcoholic beverage from sorghum. In this work, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a batch plant for producing malt drink from sorghum at industrial level is proposed. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, which is implemented and solved in GAMS using the CPLEX solver. Through experimental results, design and operation model parameters are obtained in order to develop real-fit formulation. The investment cost is minimized, and a technical-social-economical analysis is presented in order to evaluate the more profitable and sustainable option to produce malt drink from sorghum.

Often, a Keyword Spotting System (KWS) is used to detect specific wake-up words spoken by a user, as a simple user interface, or front-end layer to a larger speech recognition system. Yet, such KWS must be always active, hence imposing strict power and latency constraints. While deep learning algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) demonstrated excellent KWS accuracies, current implementations fail to fit in the tight embedded memory and power budgets. This paper presents Laika: the implementation of a KWS system using an LSTM accelerator designed in 65nm CMOS. For this application, an LSTM model is trained through a speech database and deployed on our custom, yet highly programmable LSTM accelerator. Approximate computing techniques further reduce power consumption, while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.

Currently, annotation is mostly performed by observers with medical background and is incredibly costly and time-consuming, creating a major bottleneck for the above-mentioned technologies. In this paper, we propose a way to eliminate, or at least limit, the human intervention in the annotation process.  Methods - Meaningful information about interaction between objects is inherently available in virtual reality environments. We propose a strategy to convert automatically this information into annotations in order to provide as output individual surgical process models.  Validation - We implemented our approach through a peg-transfer task simulator and compared it to manual annotations. To assess the impact of our contribution, we studied both intra- and inter-observer variability.  Results and conclusion - In average, manual annotations took more than 12 min for 1 min of video to achieve low-level physical activity annotation, whereas automatic annotation is achieved in less than a second for the same video period.

(2D) crystals, for which the shape is described
by two linear sizes, are common in fine chemical and pharmaceutical
industries. Since the crystal size and shape are directly related
to the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the simultaneous
size and shape distribution control is of paramount importance in
pharmaceutical crystallization engineering. To efficiently achieve
simultaneous size and shape control often requires model-based control
strategies; however, the increased computational cost of the process
simulation and the substantial differences between the simulated and
measurable quantities make the implementation of model-based control
approaches challenging. This paper addresses the important problem
of the real-time simulation of the most likely measurable chord length
distribution (CLD) and aspect ratio distribution (ARD) as well as
the concentration variations during the crystallization of 2D needle-shaped
crystals. This enables the application of focused beam reflectance
measurement (FBRM) and particle vision and microscopy (PVM), two routinely
applied probes, as quantitative direct feedback control tools. Artificial
neural network (ANN)-based FBRM and PVM soft-sensors are developed,
which enable the direct and fast transformation of 2D crystal size
distribution (CSD) to CLD and ARD on arbitrary 2D grids. The training
data for the ANN are generated by a first principle, geometrical model-based
simulation of FBRM and PVM for high aspect ratio crystals, although
the ANN approach is applicable for any simulated or experimental training
data sets. It is also demonstrated that the in situ imaging-based
shape measurement underestimates the real aspect ratio (AR) of crystals,
for which a simple correction is proposed. From the model-equation
solution perspective, the soft-sensors require full population balance
solution. The 2D high-resolution finite volume method is applied to
simulate the full 2D CSD, which is an accurate, stable, but computationally
expensive technique. The real-time applicability is achieved through

The use of flying platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, is rapidly growing. In particular, with their inherent attributes such as mobility, flexibility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs admit several key potential applications in wireless systems. On the one hand, UAVs can be used as aerial base stations to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless communications is presented. Moreover, the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly investigated. In particular, the key UAV challenges such as 3D deployment, performance analysis, channel modeling, and energy efficiency are explored along with representative results. Then, open problems and potential research directions pertaining to UAV communications are introduced. Finally, various analytical frameworks and mathematical tools, such as optimization theory, machine learning, stochastic geometry, transport theory, and game theory are described.

395142912,2019-11-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls represent a major public health risk worldwide for the elderly people. A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elderly and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence, and life quality. In this sense, we propose IoTE-Fall system, an intelligent system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments that takes advantages of the Internet of Thing and the ensemble machine learning algorithm. IoTE-Fall system employs a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN wearable device capable of capturing in real time the data of the movements of elderly volunteers. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, in this paper, four machine learning algorithms (classifiers): decision trees, ensemble, logistic regression, and Deepnets are evaluated in terms of AUC ROC, training time and testing time. The acceleration readings are processed and analyzed at the edge of the network using an ensemble-based predictor model that is identified as the most suitable predictor for fall detection. The experiment results from collection data, interoperability services, data processing, data analysis, alert emergency service, and cloud services show that our system achieves accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity above 94%.Research presented in this article has been partially funded by Horizon 2020 European Project grant INTER-IoT no. 687283, ACTIVAGE project under grant agreement no. 732679, the Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Ecuador, and Secretaria de Educacion Superior Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT), Ecuador.Yacchirema, D.; Suárez De Puga, J.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

196184895,2019-02-19T00:00:00,"In the past, methods for hand sign recognition have been successfully tested in Human Robot Interaction (HRI) using traditional methodologies based on static image features and machine learning. However, the recognition of gestures in video sequences is a problem still open, because current detection methods achieve low scores when the background is undefined or in unstructured scenarios. Deep learning techniques are being applied to approach a solution for this problem in recent years. In this paper, we present a study in which we analyse the performance of a 3DCNN architecture for hand gesture recognition in an unstructured scenario. The system yields a score of 73% in both accuracy and F1. The aim of the work is the implementation of a system for commanding robots with gestures recorded by video in real scenarios.This work was funded by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness from the Spanish Government through the DPI2015-68087-R and the pre-doctoral grant BES-2016-078290, by the European Commission and FEDER funds through the project COMMANDIA (SOE2/P1/F0638), action supported by Interreg-V Sudoe",'Scitepress',3DCNN Performance in Hand Gesture Recognition Applied to Robot Arm Interaction,https://core.ac.uk/download/196184895.pdf,,10.5220/0007570208020806,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
200765967,2019-05-20T12:26:52,"This is the author accepted manuscript. The final version is available from Nature Research via the DOI in this record.Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains.

We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain.

However this is a new problem since we aim to extract the temporal segments of the video where motion saliency is present. It turns out to be a frame-based classification problem. A frame will be classified as dynamically salient if it contains local motion departing from its context. Temporal motion saliency detection is relevant for applications where one needs to trigger alerts or to monitor dynamic behaviours from videos. It can also be viewed as a prerequisite before computing motion saliency maps. The proposed approach handles situations with a mobile camera. It involves two main stages consisting first in cancelling the global motion due to the camera movement, then in applying a deep learning classification framework. We have investigated two ways of implementing the first stage, based on image warping, and on residual flow respectively. Experiments on real videos demonstrate that we can obtain accurate classification in highly challenging situations",'Elsevier BV',CNN-based temporal detection of motion saliency in videos,https://core.ac.uk/download/266917895.pdf,,10.1016/j.patrec.2019.09.016,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Machine learning algorithms can be used to perform medical image classification and assist clinicians in diagnosing radiological scans. In this paper, we apply 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) to classify computed tomography (CT) brain scans into normal scans (N) and abnormal scans containing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), acute subdural hemorrhage (ASDH) and brain polytrauma hemorrhage (BPH). The dataset used consists of 399 volumetric CT brain images representing approximately 12,000 images from the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. We used a 3D CNN to perform both 2-class (normal versus a specific abnormal class) and 4-class classification (between normal, SAH, IPH, ASDH). We apply image thresholding at the image pre-processing step, that improves 3D CNN classification accuracy and performance by accentuating the pixel intensities that contribute most to feature discrimination. For 2-class classification, the F1 scores for various pairs of medical diagnoses ranged from 0.706 to 0.902 without thresholding. With thresholding implemented, the F1 scores improved and ranged from 0.919 to 0.952. Our results are comparable to, and in some cases, exceed the results published in other work applying 3D CNN to CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan classification.

ElsevierOne of the major challenges that faces today regulatory risk assessment is to speed up the way of assessing threshold sublethal detrimental effects of existing and new chemical products. Recently advances in imaging allows to monitor in real time the behaviour of individuals under a given stress. Light is a common stress for many different organisms. Fish larvae and many invertebrate species respond to light altering their behaviour. The water flea Daphnia magna as many other zooplanktonic species has a marked diel vertical phototactic swimming behaviour against light due to fish predation. The aim of this study was to develop a high throughput image analysis to study changes in the vertical swimming behaviour to light of D. magna first reproductive adult females exposed to 0.1 and 1 µg/L of four psychiatric drugs: diazepam, fluoxetine, propranolol and carbamazepine during their entire life. Experiments were conducted using a new custom designed vertical oriented four 50 mL chamber device controlled by the Noldus software (Netherlands). Changes in speed, preferred area (bottom vs upper areas) and animal aggregation were analysed using groups of animals under consecutive periods of dark and apical light stimulus of different intensities. Obtained results indicated that light intensity increased the speed but low light intensities allowed to better discriminate individual responses to the studied drugs. The four tested drugs decreased the response of exposed organisms to light: individuals move less, were closer to the bottom and at low light intensities were closer each other. At high light intensities, however, exposed individuals were less aggregated. Propranolol, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were the compounds effecting most the behaviour. Our results indicated that psychiatric drugs at environmental relevant concentrations alter the vertical phototactic behaviour of D. magna individuals and that it is possible to develop appropriate high-throughput image analysis devices to measure those responses.Peer Reviewe",'Elsevier BV',Using a new high-throughput video-tracking platform to assess behavioural changes in Daphnia magna exposed to neuro-active drugs,,"[{'title': 'The Science of The Total Environment', 'identifiers': ['issn:0048-9697', '0048-9697']}]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.187,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, synthetic-learning strategies have been used for the vision-based autonomous following of a noncooperative multirotor. The complete maneuver was learned with synthetic images and high-dimensional low-level continuous robot states, with deep- and reinforcement-learning techniques for object detection and motion control, respectively. A novel motion-control strategy for object following is introduced where the camera gimbal movement is coupled with the multirotor motion during the multirotor following.

It is essential for model assessment to be conducted in real world conditions if such models are to be reliably integrated with computer vision products for plant disease phenotyping. We train a CNN object detection model to identify foliar symptoms of diseases in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We then deploy the model in a mobile app and test its performance on mobile images and video of 720 diseased leaflets in an agricultural field in Tanzania. Within each disease category we test two levels of severity of symptoms-mild and pronounced, to assess the model performance for early detection of symptoms. In both severities we see a decrease in performance for real world images and video as measured with the F-1 score. The F-1 score dropped by 32% for pronounced symptoms in real world images (the closest data to the training data) due to a decrease in model recall.

PSD and directly transduces the light&apos;s projected position on its sensor plane into an analog current and lends itself to fast real-time tracking. A neural network, after proper training, transforms the PSD sensor reading into a 3D position of the target, which is then input to an extended trapezoidal motion planning algorithm. This algorithm implements a continuous motion update strategy in response to an ever-changing sensor information from the moving target, while greatly reducing the tracking delay. This planning method is found to be very useful for sensor-based control such as moving target tracking or weld-seam tracking in which the robot needs to change its motion in real time in response to incoming sensor information. Further, for real-time usage of the neural net, a new architecture called LANN (Locally Activated Neural Network) has been developed based on the concept of CMAC input partitioning and local learning.

Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, BIM can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, BIM is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility Management (FM). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in FM. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of FM operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image Recognition (ImR), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data.

However, because of the unpredictability and dissimilarity of user behavior it is still a big challenge. In this work, we propose to use reinforcement learning, in particular contextual bandits, to solve this problem. The proposed solution tackles the prediction in two stages: (1) detection of movement; (2) prediction of direction. In order to prove its potential for VR services, the method was deployed on an adaptive tile-based VR streaming testbed, for benchmarking against a 3D trajectory extrapolation approach.

On this subject, the research community lacks robust approaches to overcome unavailable real-world extensive data by means of realistic synthetic-information and domain-adaptation techniques. In this work, synthetic-learning strategies have been used for the vision-based autonomous following of a noncooperative multirotor. The complete maneuver was learned with synthetic images and high-dimensional low-level continuous robot states, with deep- and reinforcement-learning techniques for object detection and motion control, respectively. A novel motion-control strategy for object following is introduced where the camera gimbal movement is coupled with the multirotor motion during the multirotor following. Results confirm that our present framework can be used to deploy a vision-based task in real flight using synthetic data.

224840689,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"PURPOSE: The use of neural networks to directly predict three-dimensional dose distributions for automatic planning is becoming popular. However, the existing methods use only patient anatomy as input and assume consistent beam configuration for all patients in the training database. The purpose of this work was to develop a more general model that considers variable beam configurations in addition to patient anatomy to achieve more comprehensive automatic planning with a potentially easier clinical implementation, without the need to train specific models for different beam settings. METHODS: The proposed anatomy and beam (AB) model is based on our newly developed deep learning architecture, and hierarchically densely connected U-Net (HD U-Net), which combines U-Net and DenseNet. The AB model contains 10 input channels: one for beam setup and the other 9 for anatomical information (PTV and organs). The beam setup information is represented by a 3D matrix of the non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. We used a set of images from 129 patients with lung cancer treated with IMRT with heterogeneous beam configurations (4-9 beams of various orientations) for training/validation (100 patients) and testing (29 patients). Mean squared error was used as the loss function. We evaluated the model's accuracy by comparing the mean dose, maximum dose, and other relevant dose-volume metrics for the predicted dose distribution against those of the clinically delivered dose distribution. Dice similarity coefficients were computed to address the spatial correspondence of the isodose volumes between the predicted and clinically delivered doses. The model was also compared with our previous work, the anatomy only (AO) model, which does not consider beam setup information and uses only 9 channels for anatomical information. RESULTS: The AB model outperformed the AO model, especially in the low and medium dose regions. In terms of dose-volume metrics, AB outperformed AO by about 1-2%. The largest improvement was found to be about 5% in lung volume receiving a dose of 5Gy or more (V5 ). The improvement for spinal cord maximum dose was also important, that is, 3.6% for cross-validation and 2.6% for testing. The AB model achieved Dice scores for isodose volumes as much as 10% higher than the AO model in low and medium dose regions and about 2-5% higher in high dose regions. CONCLUSIONS: The AO model, which does not use beam configuration as input, can still predict dose distributions with reasonable accuracy in high dose regions but introduces large errors in low and medium dose regions for IMRT cases with variable beam numbers and orientations. The proposed AB model outperforms the AO model substantially in low and medium dose regions, and slightly in high dose regions, by considering beam setup information through a cumulative non-modulated beam's eye view ray-tracing dose distribution. This new model represents a major step forward towards predicting 3D dose distributions in real clinical practices, where beam configuration could vary from patient to patient, from planner to planner, and from institution to institution",'Wiley',Three-dimensional dose prediction for lung IMRT patients with deep neural networks: robust learning from heterogeneous beam configurations,,,10.1002/mp.13597,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological and complicated diseases affecting the central nervous system. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is widely used for tracking PD symptom progression. Motor- and Total-UPDRS are two important clinical scales of PD. The aim of this study is to predict UPDRS scores through analyzing the speech signal properties which is important in PD diagnosis.

We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge. As proven by previous hardware emulation tools, there is also a potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine early in the development cycle. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by predictive software running on a desktop computer. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL Safety Critical API. First, we create nonparametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames per second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated.

In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals).

186351804,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Urban planning is central to flood risk prevention. Flood-sensitive urban planning pursues two goals: reducing flood exposure and vulnerability [1]; but also addressing the influence of urban characteristics on flood flow severity (flow depths and velocities) [2]. Focusing on the latter, we present here a unique software which automatically optimizes the geometry of urban layouts to enhance flood resilience [3]. The optimized parameters describe the arrangement of the road network, the blocks, the parcels, and the buildings. The proposed approach is particularly innovative since, so far, such automatic urban design tools were developed only for totally different objectives (e.g. optimizing sun exposure or distance to parks); but not in the context of flood risk management.
Our automatic urban design system consists of three components: (i) a procedural urban model, (ii) a surrogate for a hydraulic model and (iii) an optimization engine.
•	Starting from a set of input parameters pi (typical road length, width, curvature …) the procedural urban model generates urban layouts which mimic fairly realistically real-world urban patterns [3].
•	To achieve interactive feedback (i.e. getting the results within a few seconds), the system uses a neural network (NN) to approximate the relationship between urban layout and flood flow characteristics. The NN was trained using a relatively fast 2D porosity-based hydraulic model [4], which in turn was calibrated against a detailed shallow-water model [2].
•	A Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization is used to adjust iteratively the procedural model parameters pi so as to yield the desired urban layout.
The system was tested for optimizing the layout of an urban district of 1 km by 1 km subject to river flooding. The system runs about one minute to find the optimal urban layout. The system tends to improve the flow conveyance through the urban area by increasing the voids in-between the buildings (e.g., increase road width) and by promoting a more “fragmented” urban pattern (e.g., decrease road length). The optimization reduces the flood water depths in the district by up to 20 to 25%.
Several real-world examples showcase the operationality of the system for improving flood resilience through flood-sensitive urban design [3]. In practice, such an interactive digital tool can valuably assist urban planners and architects to assess the implications of various design decisions on flooding and end up with improved flood-sensitive urban layouts. The approach should be further developed to accommodate more diverse flooding scenarios (e.g. pluvial floods, coastal floods, etc.).

However this is a new problem since we aim to extract the temporal segments of the video where motion saliency is present. It turns out to be a frame-based classification problem. A frame will be classified as dynamically salient if it contains local motion departing from its context. Temporal motion saliency detection is relevant for applications where one needs to trigger alerts or to monitor dynamic behaviours from videos. It can also be viewed as a prerequisite before computing motion saliency maps. The proposed approach handles situations with a mobile camera. It involves two main stages consisting first in cancelling the global motion due to the camera movement, then in applying a deep learning classification framework. We have investigated two ways of implementing the first stage, based on image warping, and on residual flow respectively.

For education, three-dimensional 3D models are used, which are more visual for students and simplify their studies. In entertainment, AR has found a place for itself in various social networks in the form of masks (Snapchat), games (Pokemon GO) and others. In medicine, in addition to training, AR is used to visualize the internal organs of patients.

As a recurrent unit structure, we test both Long Short-Term Memory and a Gated Recurrent Unit. We compare the proposed neural network with a WaveNet-style deep neural network, which has been suggested previously for tube ampliﬁer modelling. The neural networks are trained with several minutes of guitar and bass recordings, which have been passed through the devices to be modelled. A real-time audio plugin implementing the proposed networks has been developed in the JUCE framework. It is shown that the recurrent neural networks achieve similar accuracy to the WaveNet model, while requiring signiﬁcantly less processing power to run. The Long Short-Term Memory recurrent unit is also found to outperform the Gated Recurrent Unit overall. The proposed neural network is an important step forward in computationally efﬁcient yet accurate emulation of tube ampliﬁers anddistortion pedals.Peer reviewe",,Real-time black-box modelling with recurrent neural networks,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['2414-6382', 'issn:2413-6689', '2413-6689', 'issn:2414-6382']}]",,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The goal of this paper is to set up a fast, cheap and reliable molecular approach for qualitative detection of six neurotropic pathogens. A method based on PCR has been designed and implemented to guarantee the qualitative DNA detection of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSVI/II), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), rubella virus (RUBV) and Toxoplasma gondii in the cerebrospinal fluid, where otherwise they are barely detectable. Each PCR assay was tested using dilutions of positive controls, which demonstrated a sensitivity allowing to detect up to 102 copies/ml in PCR and 10 copies/ml in real-time PCR for each pathogen. Once been set up, the protocol was applied to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid from 100 patients with suspected infectious diseases of the central nervous system and 50 patients without any infection. The method allowed to identify 17 positive cerebrospinal fluid with polymerase chain reaction and 22 with real-time PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Therefore, application of RT PCR allows a fast and sensitive evaluation of neurotropic DNA pathogens in the course of diagnostic routine within neurological units.PubMed ID:28854791noneFerese R; Scorzolini L; Campopiano R; Albano V; Griguoli A M; Giardina E; Scala S; Ryskalin L; D'Alessio C; Zampatti S; Fantozzi R; Storto M; Fornai F; Gambardella SFerese, R; Scorzolini, L; Campopiano, R; Albano, V; Griguoli, A M; Giardina, E; Scala, S; Ryskalin, L; D'Alessio, C; Zampatti, S; Fantozzi, R; Storto, M; Fornai, F; Gambardella, ","'AEPress, s.r.o.'",PCR-based approach for qualitative molecular analysis of six neurotropic pathogens,,,10.4149/av_2017_305,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

ElsevierOne of the major challenges that faces today regulatory risk assessment is to speed up the way of assessing threshold sublethal detrimental effects of existing and new chemical products. Recently advances in imaging allows to monitor in real time the behaviour of individuals under a given stress. Light is a common stress for many different organisms. Fish larvae and many invertebrate species respond to light altering their behaviour. The water flea Daphnia magna as many other zooplanktonic species has a marked diel vertical phototactic swimming behaviour against light due to fish predation. The aim of this study was to develop a high throughput image analysis to study changes in the vertical swimming behaviour to light of D. magna first reproductive adult females exposed to 0.1 and 1 µg/L of four psychiatric drugs: diazepam, fluoxetine, propranolol and carbamazepine during their entire life. Experiments were conducted using a new custom designed vertical oriented four 50 mL chamber device controlled by the Noldus software (Netherlands). Changes in speed, preferred area (bottom vs upper areas) and animal aggregation were analysed using groups of animals under consecutive periods of dark and apical light stimulus of different intensities. Obtained results indicated that light intensity increased the speed but low light intensities allowed to better discriminate individual responses to the studied drugs. The four tested drugs decreased the response of exposed organisms to light: individuals move less, were closer to the bottom and at low light intensities were closer each other. At high light intensities, however, exposed individuals were less aggregated. Propranolol, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were the compounds effecting most the behaviour. Our results indicated that psychiatric drugs at environmental relevant concentrations alter the vertical phototactic behaviour of D. magna individuals and that it is possible to develop appropriate high-throughput image analysis devices to measure those responses.Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft",'Elsevier BV',Using a new high-throughput video-tracking platform to assess behavioural changes in Daphnia magna exposed to neuro-active drugs,https://core.ac.uk/download/294829072.pdf,"[{'title': 'The Science of The Total Environment', 'identifiers': ['issn:0048-9697', '0048-9697']}]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.187,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Real Logic is a framework where learning from numerical data and logical reasoning are integrated using first order logic syntax. The symbols of the signature of Real Logic are interpreted in the data-space, i.e, on the domain of real numbers. The integration of learning and reasoning obtained in Real Logic allows us to formalize learning as approximate satisfiability in the presence of logical constraints, and to perform inference on symbolic and numerical data. After introducing a refined version of the formalism, we describe its implementation into Logic Tensor Networks which uses deep learning within Google's Tensorflow.

417852328,2017-06-01T00:00:00,"A valid model of the air surveillance system performance is highly valued when making decisions related to the optimal control of the system. We formulate a model for a multi-radar tracker system by combining a radar performance model with a tracker performance model. A tracker as a complex software system is hard to model mathematically and physically. Our novel approach is to utilize machine learning to create a tracker model based on measurement data from which the input and target output for the model are calculated. The measured data comprises the time series of 3D coordinates of cooperative aircraft flights, the corresponding target detection recordings from multiple radars, and the related multi-radar track recordings. The collected data is used to calculate performance measures for the radars and the tracker at specific locations in the air space. We apply genetic programming to learning such rules from radar performance measures that explain tracker performance. The easily interpretable rules are intended to reveal the real behavior of the system providing comprehension for its control and further development. The learned rules allow predicting tracker performance level for the system control in all radar geometries, modes, and conditions at any location. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of our approach to learning a tracker model and compare our rule learner with two tree classifiers, another rule learner, a neural network, and an instance-based classifier using the real air surveillance data.

235261716,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore.

This increases the knowledge of what is happening in the soundscape, and this information encourages any monitoring system to take decisions depending on the measured events. Our research in this field includes, on one hand, smart city applications, which aim is to develop a low cost sensor network for real time noise mapping in the cities, and on the other hand, ambient assisted living applications through audio event recognition at home. This requires acoustic signal processing for event recognition, which is a challenging problem applying feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods. Furthermore, when the techniques come closer to implementation, a complete study of the most suitable platform is needed, taking into account computational complexity of the algorithms and commercial platforms price. In this work, the comparative study of several platforms serving to implement this sensing application is detailed. An FPGA platform is chosen as the optimum proposal considering the application requirements and taking into account time restrictions of the signal processing algorithms.

144867413,2017-10-16,"Fast and accurate object detection is a desire of many vision-guided robotics based systems. Agriculture is an area where detection accuracy is often sacrificed for speed, especially in the pursuit of real time results. Pastoral landscapes are especially challenging with varying levels of complexity, as competing objects are rarely textually smooth or visibly different from surroundings. This study presents a machine learning algorithm designed for object detection called the Multiple Expert Colour Extreme Learning Machine (MEC-ELM). The MEC-ELM is a multiple expert implementation of a Colour Feature Extreme Learning Machine (CF-ELM). The CF-ELM is itself a modification of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with a partially connected hidden layer and a fully connected output layer, taking 3 inputs. The inputs can be utilised by multiple colour systems, including, RGB, Y'UV and HSV. Colour inputs were chosen, as colour is not sensitive to adjustments in scale, size and location and provides information not available in the standard grey-scale ELM. In the MEC-ELM algorithm, feature extraction and classification techniques were implemented simultaneously making a fully functional object detection algorithm. The algorithm was tested on weed detection and cattle detection from a video feed, delivering 0.89 (cattle) to 0.98 (weeds) accuracy in tuning and a precision of 0.61 to 0.95 in testing, with classification times between 0.5s to 1s per frame.

78397771,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive periodontitis is associated with the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a leukotoxin (Ltx)-producing periodontal pathogen. Ltx has the ability to lyse white blood cells including neutrophils. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at investigating the interactions between neutrophils and Ltx with regard to the chemotactic properties of Ltx and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). METHODS: Neutrophils from healthy blood donors were isolated and incubated for 30 min and 3 h with increasing concentrations of Ltx (1, 10, and 100 ng/mL) as well as with A. actinomycetemcomitans strains (NCTC 9710 and HK 1651) producing different levels of Ltx. Formation of NETs and cell lysis were assessed by microscopy, fluorescence-based assays, and measurement of released lactate dehydrogenase. Neutrophil migration in response to different Ltx gradients was monitored by real-time video microscopy, and image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. RESULTS: Although Ltx (10 and 100 ng/mL) and the leukotoxic A. actinomycetemcomitans strain HK 1651 lysed some neutrophils, other cells were still capable of performing NETosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Low doses of Ltx and the weakly leukotoxic strain NCTC 9710 did not lead to neutrophil lysis, but did induce some NETosis. Furthermore, all three concentrations of Ltx enhanced random neutrophil movement; however, low directional accuracy was observed compared with the positive control (fMLP). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Ltx acts both as a neutrophil activator and also causes cell death. In addition, Ltx directly induces NETosis in neutrophils prior to cell lysis. In future studies, the underlying pathways involved in Ltx-meditated neutrophil activation and NETosis need to be investigated further.Virulence mechanisms of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxi",'Co-Action Publishing',Effects of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin on neutrophil migration and extracellular trap formation.,10.3402/jom.v8.33070,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fast 2d cine MRI sequences are expected to increase the precision of radiation delivery by facilitating tumour delineation during treatment. This study compares four auto-contouring algorithms for the task of delineating the primary tumour in six locally advanced (LA) lung cancer patients.Twenty-two cine MRI sequences were acquired using either a balanced steady-state free precession or a spoiled gradient echo imaging technique. Contours derived by the auto-contouring algorithms were compared against manual reference contours. A selection of eight image data sets was also used to assess the inter-observer delineation uncertainty.Algorithmically derived contours agreed well with the manual reference contours (median Dice similarity index: ⩾0.91). Multi-template matching and deformable image registration performed significantly better than feature-driven registration and the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). Neither MRI sequence nor image orientation was a conclusive predictor for algorithmic performance. Motion significantly degraded the performance of the PCNN.

A real-time image-guided technique can be used to monitor such lung tumor motion for accurate dose delivery, but the system latency up to several hundred milliseconds for repositioning the radiation beam also affects the accuracy. In order to compensate the latency, neural network prediction technique with real-time retraining can be used. We have investigated real-time prediction of 3D time series of lung tumor motion on a classical linear model, perceptron model, and on a class of higher-order neural network model that has more attractive attributes regarding its optimization convergence and computational efficiency. The implemented static feed-forward neural architectures are compared when using gradient descent adaptation and primarily the Levenberg-Marquardt batch algorithm as the ones of the most common and most comprehensible learning algorithms. The proposed technique resulted in fast real-time retraining, so the total computational time on a PC platform was equal to or even less than the real treatment time.

160467102,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Background/Aims: Apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The impact of aTRH and achievement of recommended blood pressure (BP) values on the rate of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss in CKD patients is poorly known. To assess the role of aTRH and time-updated BP control (BPC) on the progression of CKD in patients with T2D and hypertension (HT) in real life clinical practice. Methods: Clinical records from a total of 2,778 diabetic patients with HT and stage 3 CKD (i.e. baseline eGFR values between 30 and 60 ml/min) and regular visits during a four-year follow-up were analyzed. The association between BPC (i.e. 75% of visits with BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) and eGFR loss (i.e. a &gt;30% reduction from baseline) or worsening of albuminuria status over time was assessed. Results: At baseline 33% of patients had aTRH. Over the 4-year follow-up, 20% had a &gt;30% eGFR reduction. Patients with aTRH had an increased risk of eGFR loss &gt;30% (OR 1.31; P&lt;0.007). In patients with aTRH, BPC was associated with a 79% (P=0.029) greater risk of eGFR reduction despite a 58% (P=0.001) lower risk of albuminuria status worsening. In non-aTRH, no association was found between BPC and renal outcome. Conclusion: In patients with stage 3 CKD the presence of aTRH entails a faster loss of eGFR.

From the recorded samples, several audio features are extracted and a machine learning method is used to find the features that best described performance quality according to musician’s annotations.

132714466,2017-09-01T00:00:00,"Bulk body motion may randomly occur during PET acquisitions introducing blurring, attenuation emission mismatches and, in dynamic PET, discontinuities in the measured time activity curves between consecutive frames. Meanwhile, dynamic PET scans are longer, thus increasing the probability of bulk motion. In this study, we propose a streamlined 3D PET motion-compensated image reconstruction (3D-MCIR) framework, capable of robustly deconvolving intra-frame motion from a static or dynamic 3D sinogram. The presented 3D-MCIR methods need not partition the data into multiple gates, such as 4D MCIR algorithms, or access list-mode (LM) data, such as LM MCIR methods, both associated with increased computation or memory resources. The proposed algorithms can support compensation for any periodic and non-periodic motion, such as cardio-respiratory or bulk motion, the latter including rolling, twisting or drifting. Inspired from the widely adopted point-spread function (PSF) deconvolution 3D PET reconstruction techniques, here we introduce an image-based 3D generalized motion deconvolution method within the standard 3D maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction framework. In particular, we initially integrate a motion blurring kernel, accounting for every tracked motion within a frame, as an additional MLEM modeling component in the image space (integrated 3D-MCIR). Subsequently, we replaced the integrated model component with a nested iterative Richardson-Lucy (RL) image-based deconvolution method to accelerate the MLEM algorithm convergence rate (RL-3D-MCIR). The final method was evaluated with realistic simulations of whole-body dynamic PET data employing the XCAT phantom and real human bulk motion profiles, the latter estimated from volunteer dynamic MRI scans. In addition, metabolic uptake rate K-i parametric images were generated with the standard Patlak method. Our results demonstrate significant improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and noise bias performance in both dynamic and parametric images.

335619155,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The Audio-to-Score framework consists of two separate stages: pre- processing and alignment. The alignment is commonly solved through offline Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which is a method to find the path over the distortion matrix with the minimum cost to determine the relation between the performance and the musical score times. In this work we propose a par- allel online DTW solution based on a client-server architecture. The current version of the application has been implemented for multi-core architectures (x86, x64 and ARM), thus covering either powerful systems or mobile devices. An extensive experimentation has been conducted in order to validate the software. The experiments also show that our framework allows to achieve a good score alignment within the real-time window by using parallel computing techniques.This work has been partially supported by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER under Projects TEC2012-38142-C04-01, TEC2012-38142-C04-03, TEC2012-38142-C04-04, TEC2015-67387-C4-1-R, TEC2015-67387-C4-3-R, TEC2015-67387-C4-4-R, the European Union FEDER (CAPAP-H5 network TIN2014-53522-REDT), and the Generalitat Valenciana under Grant PROMETEOII/2014/003.Alonso-Jordá, P.; Cortina, R.; Rodríguez-Serrano, F.; Vera-Candeas, P.; Alonso-González, M.; Ranilla, J.

applications, but no single analysis pipeline can be
used in all cases. We review all of the major steps in
RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design,
quality control, read alignment, quantification of gene
and transcript levels, visualization, differential gene
expression, alternative splicing, functional analysis,
gene fusion detection and eQTL mapping. We
highlight the challenges associated with each step.
We discuss the analysis of small RNAs and the
integration of RNA-seq with other functional
genomics techniques. Finally, we discuss the outlook
for novel technologies that are changing the state of
the art in transcriptomics.The authors would like to thank Michael Love and Harold Pimentel for

275635798,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wellness state is affected by the habitability state of the domestic environment. Monitoring it can help to discover the causes of a low wellness levels aiding people in the improvement of their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a system to monitor the wellness state of people utilizing Likert¿s scale to determine the state of the user through an emoticon-based human¿computer interaction. The system is intended for domestic environments and measures the habitability conditions of the dwelling (such as temperature, humidity, luminosity and noise) employing sensors. An algorithm is designed in order to establish how to measure those conditions and to calculate the statistics that allows tracking their progress. The obtained information is presented to the user to compare his/her wellness state with the habitability conditions. Measures in a real domestic environment were performed in order to determine the configuration of our system. The energy efficiency of the algorithm provides an improvement between 99.36 and 99.62% in the energy consumption depending on the selected parameters.This work has been partially supported by the “Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación”, through the “Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008–2011” and by the “Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte”, through the grand “Ayudas para contratos predoctorales de Formación del Profesorado Universitario FPU14/02953”.García-García, L.; Parra-Boronat, L.; Romero Martínez, JO.; Lloret, J.

One is linked to the most ordinary materiality, the other to the immaterial whose consequences in the so-called ""real"" world remain to be discovered. The one is obviously of artistic nature, the other takes the opposite side of this demonstration to, undoubtedly, affirm an art of side as one speaks about a ""step of side"" and questions the aesthetic dimension of a making without will to make art. One was the result of a crisis of painting where I wondered what I could do interesting in this field after graduating from the Beaux-Arts and the other, of a discovery, that of free software and the principles that govern them via the legal formalization of licenses that state the rights.The first practice, I gave it the name of ""Vitagraphy"", which means ""traces of life"" and the second one is a play on words invented to qualify free software, the ""copyleft"" and which was going to be the main thread of the Free Art License of which I am at the initiative and co-editor.Je vais faire ici état de deux pratiques qui apparemment n'ont pas de rapport entre elles, sauf l'interrogation qu'elles peuvent provoquer concernant le travail de l'auteur et la qualité de l'œuvre.

288358137,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Two-dimensional (2D) crystals, for which the shape is described by two linear sizes, are common in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Since the crystal size and shape are directly related to the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the simultaneous size and shape distribution control is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical crystallization engineering. To efficiently achieve simultaneous size and shape control often requires model-based control strategies; however, the increased computational cost of the process simulation and the substantial differences between the simulated and measurable quantities make the implementation of model-based control approaches challenging. This paper addresses the important problem of the real-time simulation of the most likely measurable chord length distribution (CLD) and aspect ratio distribution (ARD) as well as the concentration variations during the crystallization of 2D needle-shaped crystals. This enables the application of focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) and particle vision and microscopy (PVM), two routinely applied probes, as quantitative direct feedback control tools. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based FBRM and PVM soft-sensors are developed, which enable the direct and fast transformation of 2D crystal size distribution (CSD) to CLD and ARD on arbitrary 2D grids. The training data for the ANN are generated by a first principle, geometrical model-based simulation of FBRM and PVM for high aspect ratio crystals, although the ANN approach is applicable for any simulated or experimental training data sets. It is also demonstrated that the in situ imaging-based shape measurement underestimates the real aspect ratio (AR) of crystals, for which a simple correction is proposed. From the model-equation solution perspective, the soft-sensors require full population balance solution. The 2D high-resolution finite volume method is applied to simulate the full 2D CSD, which is an accurate, stable, but computationally expensive technique. The real-time applicability is achieved through various implementation improvements including grid optimization and data-type optimized hybrid central processing unit-graphical processing unit calculations",,Aspect ratio distribution and chord length distribution driven modeling of crystallization of two-dimensional crystals for real-time model-based applications,,https://core.ac.uk/download/288358137.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
111082602,2017-12-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy guidance based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently becoming a clinical reality. Fast 2d cine MRI sequences are expected to increase the precision of radiation delivery by facilitating tumour delineation during treatment. This study compares four auto-contouring algorithms for the task of delineating the primary tumour in six locally advanced (LA) lung cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two cine MRI sequences were acquired using either a balanced steady-state free precession or a spoiled gradient echo imaging technique. Contours derived by the auto-contouring algorithms were compared against manual reference contours. A selection of eight image data sets was also used to assess the inter-observer delineation uncertainty. RESULTS: Algorithmically derived contours agreed well with the manual reference contours (median Dice similarity index: ⩾0.91). Multi-template matching and deformable image registration performed significantly better than feature-driven registration and the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). Neither MRI sequence nor image orientation was a conclusive predictor for algorithmic performance. Motion significantly degraded the performance of the PCNN. The inter-observer variability was of the same order of magnitude as the algorithmic performance. CONCLUSION: Auto-contouring of tumours on cine MRI is feasible in LA lung cancer patients. Despite large variations in implementation complexity, the different algorithms all have relatively similar performance",,Tumour auto-contouring on 2d cine MRI for locally advanced lung cancer: A comparative study,,https://core.ac.uk/download/111082602.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
379236211,2017-11-01T00:00:00,"Accurately detecting and counting sparse bacterial samples has many applications in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical processing industries, in medical diagnostics, and for life detection by robotic missions to other planets and moons of the solar system. Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL).

It is a revolutionary concept with far reaching implications, and it is opening up new applications and shaping the future of entire industries. It is applied in self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles in agriculture, digital dermascopes that help specialists make more accurate diagnoses, among many other unique and cutting-edge applications. The design of such systems gives rise to new challenges for embedded Software developers. Embedded vision applications are characterized by stringent performance constraints to guarantee real-time behaviours and, at the same time, energy constraints to save battery on the mobile platforms. In this paper, we address such challenges by proposing an overall view of the problem and by analysing current solutions. We present our last results on embedded vision design automation over two main aspects: the adoption of the model-based paradigm for the embedded vision rapid prototyping, and the application of heterogeneous programming languages to improve the system performance.

The new implementation, which is coded in C++ and takes advantage of the parallelization functionalities both on CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units), was validated using different benchmark cases and compared, in terms of numerical output and computational efficiency, with other well-known hydraulic software packages. Depending on the complexity of the specific test case, the new parallel implementation can achieve speedups up to two orders of magnitude when compared with the standard version. The speedup is especially remarkable for the GPU parallelization that uses Nvidia CUDA (compute unified device architecture). The efficiency is as good as the one provided by some of the most popular hydraulic models. We also present the application of Iber+ to model an extreme flash flood that took place in the Spanish Pyrenees in October 2012. The new implementation was used to simulate 24 h of real time in roughly eight minutes of computing time, while the standard version needed more than 15 h. This huge improvement in computational efficiency opens up the possibility of using the code for real-time forecasting of flood events in early-warning systems, in order to help decision making under hazardous events that need a fast intervention to deploy countermeasures.Water JPI—WaterWorks Programme, project Improving

Composing questions in the examination process to measure students’ achievement in the school teaching and learning process can be difficult and time consuming. To solve this problem, this research proposes Automatic Question Generation (AQG) method to generate Open Domain Indonesian Question by using syntactical approach. Open Domain questions are questions covering many domains of knowledge. The challenge of generating the questions is how to identify the types of declarative sentences that are

potential to be transformed into questions and how to develop the method for generating question

automatically. In realizing the method, this research incorporates four stages, namely: the identification of

declarative sentence for 8 coarse-class and 19 fine-class sentences, the classification of features for coarseclass

sentence and the classification rules for fine-class sentence, the identification of question patterns, and the extraction of sentence’s components as well as the rule generation of questions. The coarse-class classification was carried out based on a machine learning with syntactical features of the sentence, namely:

Part of Speech (POS) Tag, the presence of punctuation, the availability of specific verbs, sequence of words, etc. The fine-class classification was carried out based on a set of rules. According to the implementation and experiment, the findings show that the accuracy of coarse-class classification reaches

83.26% by using the SMO classifier and the accuracy of proposed fine-class classification reaches 92%. The generated questions are categorized into three types, namely: TRUE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and FALSE. The accuracy of generated TRUE and UNDERSTANDABLE questions reaches 88.66%. Thus, the

Concept of Automated Vehicle in the era of the fourth industrial revolution is transforming from the `vehicle` that had its focal point in the hardware to the `portable computer` that has its focus in the software that processes broad range of digital information. The phenomenon in one aspect is innovation through scientific technology. However on the other hand, it is raising humanistic, philosophical and legal questions about how human life will change according to the technological and industrial transition. Age of `Artificial Intelligence` and `Posthuman` emerging through the development of technology is creating new concept of human and bringing forward the issue of new danger that is occurring when reason and physical abilities thought as the essence of `human` is being substituted by scientific technology and computer. The advocates of automated vehicle assert that it provides more safety and convenience to human. Such argument cannot be completely be false, and I wish to reach the same conclusion eventually. However, as other process of introducing new technology like nuclear energy tell us, to consider whether automated vehicle is more convenient and better than the previous vehicle system and whether there are no new danger that new technology is bringing about or overlooked elements of danger is severely important. Therefore, if certain danger is expected, technological prevention should be devised as a first step, and for the sections where technology and industry is not self-regulating, it is legislations and policies` role to lead and force to a human-friendly direction. Automated vehicle that is being discussed nowadays can be neutral itself and seem to be no more than a convenient device. However, since each automated vehicle is activated by entering massive amount of digital information and since it collects, stores, and distributes a welter of personal information when connected to Internet of Things(IoT), whole new danger from the previous era is created in terms of personal information and privacy. The ironic reality of surveillance society since the modern times that has assured freedom of an individual on the one hand and has reinforced utilitarian society control on the grounds of fully protecting one`s right and expanding welfare on the other lies beneath this near future. Especially, personal information is more being exposed and distributed and collection and surveillance of digital information is becoming easier in the information age. Automated vehicle system cannot be free from such exposure and danger of violating since it is operated with geolocation, video, and communication information as well. Moreover, since violation of personal information can lead to violation of privacy and human dignity, and damage the basic order of liberal democracy, arranging the frame of public regulation relating to personal information protection by researching U.S. and European Union legislation and seems more than necessary. Being awake is what sovereign needs in the digital era. Likewise, to secure right to personal information, we should remember to turn the monitoring lamp on in advance not only as an individual, but also as a group in order to obtain convenience and prevent danger of new era of automated vehicle.��� ��������� ��������������� ������������������������������ ���������������(HY-2014������)",������������������������,Public Law Perspectives on Personal Information Protection in the Era of Automated Vehicle,,,"[{'title': 'Korean Journal of Law and Society', 'identifiers': ['1227-0954', 'issn:1227-0954']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It involves the injection of stabilizing materials into liquefiable saturated sand. In this study, a pilot-scale facility (243cm by 366cm in plan×122cm deep) was used to inject a dilute colloidal silica stabilizer into liquefiable sand specimens. The grout advancement was monitored in real time using electrical conductivity cells embedded in the specimens. Injection rates ranging from 65 to 9000ml/min/well were used to investigate the optimal rate of grout delivery. In tests with low injection rates, the delivery performance was low due to sinking, while at higher injection rates, sinking was less noticeable. After the treatment, the degree of grout penetration was evaluated by excavating the model. The in situ unconfined compressive strength was measured using a pocket penetrometer, and soil blocks were excavated for additional unconfined compressive testing. Moreover, the 3-D flood simulator, UTCHEM, was utilized to simulate the experimental results and to predict the injection rates for adequate stabilizer delivery. The results of the strength testing demonstrated that as little as 1% by weight of the colloidal silica provides a significant improvement in strength after a month of curing.

A U-Net type of convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to classify muscle tissue, and partitioned into a semantic measurement kernel based on LV length and ventricular orientation. Dense tissue motion was predicted using stacked U-Net architectures with image warping of intermediate flow, designed to tackle variable displacements. Training was performed on a mixture of real and synthetic data. The resulting segmentation and motion estimates was fused in a Kalman filter and used as basis for measuring global longitudinal strain. For reference, 2D ultrasound images from 21 subjects were acquired using a GE Vivid system. Data was analyzed by two specialists using a semi-automatic tool for longitudinal function estimates in a commercial system, and further compared to output of the proposed method.

Among others, the safe, re-targetable and precise landing is a mandatory requirement which entails a strong level of on board autonomy to make the maneuver timely, effective and robust, no matter of the Earth-planet distance, which may significantly affect the communication chain delays, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the safe touchdown success. Moreover, planetary surface morphology is often roughly characterized before being in the natural object proximity. Therefore while the landing site is precisely identified according to its scientific and commercial benefits, it turns out to be largely affected by uncertainty on its surrounding morphology and hazardousness, an awareness that is needed to smoothly drive the lander to its target. It is straightforward that an autonomous landing system capable of safe pinpoint landings would improve in situ exploration missions' flexibility and performance. Several building blocks constitute an autonomous landing system, among which one of the most critical is hazard detector. This system works on data fused from the on board Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) sensors, being those typically optical sensors: LIDARs allow directly reconstructing the 3D terrain maps, being heavy and expensive sensors; cameras, either in mono or stereo configuration, adopt simple image processing techniques to recognize hazards but they typically struggle in non-sharp terrain features, such as smooth slopes, recognition.

This is a simple and accurate method to reconstruct objects from point clouds obtained from multiple overlapping views using low-cost sensors. In contrast to other methods that may need several stages that include downsampling, noise filtering and many other tasks, the NG automatically obtains the 3D model of the scanned objects. To demonstrate the validity of our proposal we tested our method with several models and performed a study of the neural network parameterization computing the quality of representation and also comparing results with other neural methods like growing neural gas and Kohonen maps or classical methods like Voxel Grid. We also reconstructed models acquired by low cost sensors that can be used in virtual and augmented reality environments for redesign or manipulation purposes. Since the NG algorithm has a strong computational cost we propose its acceleration. We have redesigned and implemented the NG learning algorithm to fit it onto Graphics Processing Units using CUDA.

299434479,2015,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

In this work, the regression problem for multivariate systems is solved by implementing an efficient probabilistic incremental algorithm. It allows learning high-dimensional redundant non-linear maps by the cumulative acquisition of data from input-output systems. The proposed model is aimed at solving prediction and inference problems. The implementation introduced in this work allows learning from data batches without the need of keeping them in memory afterwards. The learning architecture is built using Incremental Gaussian Mixture Models. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm and general geometric properties of Gaussian distributions are used to train the models. Our current implementation can produce accurate results fitting models in real multivariate systems. Results are shown from testing the algorithm for both situations, one where the incremental learning is demonstrated and the second where the performance to solve the regression problem is evaluated on a toy example.Peer Reviewe",'IOS Press',Multivariate Regression with Incremental Learning of Gaussian Mixture Models,10.3233/978-1-61499-806-8-196,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Safety applications as well as inherent VANET characteristics make data dissemination an essential service and a challenging task. We are developing a decentralized efficient solution for broadcast data dissemination through two game-theoretical mechanisms. Besides, VANETs can also include autonomous vehicles (AVs). AVs might represent a revolutionary new paradigm that can be a reality in our cities in the next few years. AVs do not need a driver to work; instead, they should copy a proper human behavior to adapt the driving according to the current circumstances, such as speed limit, pedestrian crossing street or wheather conditions. We will develop an AV software module including artificial intelligence (AI) techniques so that AVs can interact with the dynamic scenario throughout time. Finally, we also will include electrical vehicles (EV) in the VANET, so that special services such as finding and reserving an EV charging station place will be welcome. In addition, we are developing a multimetric geographic routing protocol for VANETs to transmit H.265 video (traffic accident, traffic state, commercial….) over VANETsPeer Reviewe",'Universitat Politecnica de Valencia',Multimedia communications in vehicular adhoc networks for several applications in the smart cities,10.4995/JITEL2017.2017.6584,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
160311734,2018-07-23T00:00:00Z,"Two-dimensional
(2D) crystals, for which the shape is described
by two linear sizes, are common in fine chemical and pharmaceutical
industries. Since the crystal size and shape are directly related
to the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the simultaneous
size and shape distribution control is of paramount importance in
pharmaceutical crystallization engineering. To efficiently achieve
simultaneous size and shape control often requires model-based control
strategies; however, the increased computational cost of the process
simulation and the substantial differences between the simulated and
measurable quantities make the implementation of model-based control
approaches challenging. This paper addresses the important problem
of the real-time simulation of the most likely measurable chord length
distribution (CLD) and aspect ratio distribution (ARD) as well as
the concentration variations during the crystallization of 2D needle-shaped
crystals. This enables the application of focused beam reflectance
measurement (FBRM) and particle vision and microscopy (PVM), two routinely
applied probes, as quantitative direct feedback control tools. Artificial
neural network (ANN)-based FBRM and PVM soft-sensors are developed,
which enable the direct and fast transformation of 2D crystal size
distribution (CSD) to CLD and ARD on arbitrary 2D grids. The training
data for the ANN are generated by a first principle, geometrical model-based
simulation of FBRM and PVM for high aspect ratio crystals, although
the ANN approach is applicable for any simulated or experimental training
data sets. It is also demonstrated that the in situ imaging-based
shape measurement underestimates the real aspect ratio (AR) of crystals,
for which a simple correction is proposed. From the model-equation
solution perspective, the soft-sensors require full population balance
solution. The 2D high-resolution finite volume method is applied to
simulate the full 2D CSD, which is an accurate, stable, but computationally
expensive technique. The real-time applicability is achieved through
various implementation improvements including grid optimization and
data-type optimized hybrid central processing unit–graphical
processing unit calculations",,"Aspect Ratio Distribution and Chord Length Distribution

invasive open-system core-flooding experiment and compared the results
of the pre- and postflooded states of an experimental sandstone core
sample from an ongoing field trial for carbon dioxide geosequestration.
For the experiment, a rock core sample of 80 mL volume was taken from
the 629 m Stuttgart Formation storage domain of a saline sandstone
aquifer at the CCS research pilot plant Ketzin, Germany. Supercritical
carbon dioxide and synthetical brine were injected under in situ reservoir
p/T-conditions at an average flow rate of 0.1 mL/min for 256 h. X-ray
computed microtomographic imaging was carried out before and after
the core-flooding experiment at a spatial voxel resolution of 27 μm.
No significant changes in microstructure were found at the tomographic
imaging resolution including porosity and pore size distribution,
except of an increase of depositional heterogeneous distribution of
clay minerals in the pores. The digitized rock data were used as direct
real microstructure input to the GeoDict software package, to simulate
Navier–Stokes flow by a lattice Boltzmann equation solver.
This procedure yielded 3D pressure and flow velocity fields, and revealed
that the migration of clay particles decreased the permeability tensor

Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures, robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their tasks. In this situation, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require the robot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode, that is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In addition, most of the RL methods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking robots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a solution (e.g., hours of learning). In this paper, we introduce a novel learning algorithm called "" Reset-free Trial-and-Error "" (RTE) that (1) breaks the complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics simulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover from damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into account. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated six-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in several ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.) and whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena. Our experiments show that the robots can recover most of their locomotion abilities in an environment with obstacles, and without any human intervention",'Elsevier BV',Reset-free Trial-and-Error Learning for Robot Damage Recovery,10.1016/j.robot.2017.11.010,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The CFUST distribution provides a flexible family to model non-normal data, with parameters for capturing skewness and heavy-tails in the data. It formally encompasses the normal, t, and skew normal distributions as special and/or limiting cases. A few other versions of the skew t-distributions are also nested within the CFUST distribution. In this paper, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is described for computing the ML estimates of the parameters of the FM-CFUST model, and different strategies for initializing the algorithm are discussed and illustrated. The methodology is implemented in the EMMIXcskew package, and examples are presented using two real datasets. The EMMIXcskew package contains functions to fit the FM-CFUST model, including procedures for generating different initial values.

79528985,2016-10-01T00:00:00,"OBJECTIVE: Root canal irrigation is an important adjunct to control microbial infection. This study aimed primarily to develop a transparent root canal model to study in situ Enterococcus faecalis biofilm removal rate and remaining attached biofilm using passive or active irrigation solution for 90s. The change in available chlorine and pH of the outflow irrigant were assessed. METHODS: A total of forty root canal models (n=10 per group) were manufactured using 3D printing. Each model consisted of two longitudinal halves of an 18mm length simulated root canal with size 30 and taper 0.06. E. faecalis biofilms were grown on the apical 3mm of the models for 10days in Brain Heart Infusion broth. Biofilms were stained using crystal violet for visualization. The model halves were reassembled, attached to an apparatus and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Following 60s of 9mL of 2.5% NaOCl irrigation using syringe and needle, the irrigant was either left stagnant in the canal or activated using gutta-percha, sonic and ultrasonic methods for 30s. Images were then captured every second using an external camera. The residual biofilm percentages were measured using image analysis software. The data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and generalized linear mixed model. RESULTS: The highest level of biofilm removal was with ultrasonic agitation (90.13%) followed by sonic (88.72%), gutta-percha (80.59%), and passive irrigation group (control) (43.67%) respectively. All agitation groups reduced the available chlorine and pH of NaOCl more than that in the passive irrigation group. SIGNIFICANCE: The 3D printing method provided a novel model to create a root canal simulation for studying and understanding a real-time biofilm removal under microscopy. Ultrasonic agitation of NaOCl left the least amount of residual biofilm in comparison to sonic and gutta-percha agitation methods",,A novel experimental approach to investigate the effect of different agitation methods using sodium hypochlorite as an irrigant on the rate of bacterial biofilm removal from the wall of a simulated root canal model,,https://core.ac.uk/download/79528985.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is high demand for tracking running performance and progress for amateurs and professionals alike. The parameters velocity and distance are thereby of main interest. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of four algorithms, which calculate the stride velocity and stride length during running using data of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed in the midsole of a running shoe. The four algorithms are based on stride time, foot acceleration, foot trajectory estimation, and deep learning, respectively. They are compared using two studies: a laboratory-based study comprising 2377 strides from 27 subjects with 3D motion tracking as a reference and a field study comprising 12 subjects performing a 3.2-km run in a real-world setup. The results show that the foot trajectory estimation algorithm performs best, achieving a mean error of 0.032 ± 0.274 m/s for the velocity estimation and 0.022 ± 0.157 m for the stride length. An interesting alternative for systems with a low energy budget is the acceleration-based approach.

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2). Video detection of cells at 105, 104, 103, and 100 cells/mL is demonstrated in real time using un-reconstructed holograms.

The network is capable of reconstructing a full scene from a single depth image by creating a 3D representation of it and automatically filling holes and inserting hidden elements. We exploit the fact that our neural network is capable of generalizing object shapes by inferring similarities in geometry. Our fully convolutional architecture enables the network to be unconstrained by a fixed 3D shape, and so it is capable of successfully reconstructing arbitrary scene sizes. Our algorithm was evaluated on a real word dataset of tabletop scenes acquired using a Kinect and processed using KinectFusion software in order to obtain ground truth for network training and evaluation. Extensive measurements show that our deep neural network architecture outperforms the previous state of the art both in terms of precision and recall for the scene reconstruction task. The network has been broadly profiled in terms of memory footprint, number of floating point operations, inference time and power consumption in CPU, GPU and embedded devices.

43491761,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro.

Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures, robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their tasks. In this situation, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require the robot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode, that is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In addition, most of the RL methods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking robots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a solution (e.g., hours of learning). In this paper, we introduce a novel learning algorithm called "" Reset-free Trial-and-Error "" (RTE) that (1) breaks the complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics simulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover from damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into account. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated six-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in several ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.) and whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena.

275626014,2017-04-01T00:00:00,"Progress in biomechanical modelling of human soft tissue is the basis for the development of new clinical applications capable of improving the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases (e.g. cancer), as well as the surgical planning and guidance of some interventions. The finite element method (FEM) is one of the most popular techniques used to predict the deformation of the human soft tissue due to its high accuracy. However, FEM has an associated high computational cost, which makes it difficult its integration in real-time computer-aided surgery systems. An alternative for simulating the mechanical behaviour of human organs in real time comes from the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, which are much faster than FEM. This paper assesses the feasibility of ML methods for modelling the biomechanical behaviour of the human liver during the breathing process, which is crucial for guiding surgeons during interventions where it is critical to track this deformation (e.g. some specific kind of biopsies) or for the accurate application of radiotherapy dose to liver tumours. For this purpose, different ML regression models were investigated, including three tree-based methods (decision trees, random forests and extremely randomised trees) and other two simpler regression techniques (dummy model and linear regression). In order to build and validate the ML models, a labelled data set was constructed from modelling the deformation of eight ex-vivo human livers using FEM. The best prediction performance was obtained using extremely randomised trees, with a mean error of 0.07 mm and all the samples with an error under 1 mm. The achieved results lay the foundation for the future development of some real-time software capable of simulating the human liver deformation during the breathing process during clinical interventions.This work has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) through research projects TIN2014-52033-R and DPI2013-40859-R, both also supported by European FEDER funds.

A vast amount of systems aiming to enhance the learning process of a musical instrument are being developed in the recent years. However, most of the systems focus on the assessment of pitch and onset accuracy, and very few pay attention to tone quality. This is particularly true in violin music education, where although a consensus exist on what is a good or a bad tone quality, there is not a formal definition due to its subjectivity. We present a machine learning approach for the automatic assessment of violin tone quality. We depart from our previous work on the preliminary modelling of several dimensions involving tone quality.

Hearing loss, a partial or total inability to hear, is one of the most commonly reported disabilities. A hearing test can be carried out by an audiologist to assess a patient’s auditory system. However, the procedure requires an appointment, which can result in delays and practitioner fees. In addition, there are often challenges associated with the unavailability of equipment and qualified practitioners, particularly in remote areas. This paper presents a novel idea that automatically identifies any hearing impairment based on a cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition approach. The proposed system uses an adaptive filter bank with weighted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for feature extraction. The adaptive filter bank implementation is inspired by the principle of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio that is aware of its environment and adapts to statistical variations in the input stimuli by learning from the environment. Comparative performance evaluation demonstrates the potential of our automated hearing test method to achieve comparable results to the clinical ground truth, established by the expert audiologist’s tests. The overall absolute error of the proposed model when compared with the expert audiologist test is less than 4.9 dB and 4.4 dB for the pure tone and speech audiometry tests, respectively. The overall accuracy achieved is 96.67% with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The proposed method potentially offers a second opinion to audiologists, and serves as a cost-effective pre-screening test to predict hearing loss at an early stage. In future work, authors intend to explore the application of advanced deep learning and optimization approaches to further enhance the performance of the automated testing prototype considering imperfect datasets with real-world background noise.Published versio",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition for automated hearing loss testing,10.1007/s12559-018-9607-4,https://core.ac.uk/download/286356367.pdf,"[{'title': 'Cognitive Computation', 'identifiers': ['issn:1866-9964', '1866-9956', '1866-9964', 'issn:1866-9956']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
162017749,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Fabrication of three-dimensional structures has gained increasing importance in the bone tissue engineering (BTE) field. Mechanical properties and permeability are two important requirement for BTE scaffolds. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds are highly dependent on the processing parameters. Layer thickness, delay time between spreading each powder layer, and printing orientation are the major factors that determine the porosity and compression strength of the 3D printed scaffold. In this study, the aggregated artificial neural network (AANN) was used to investigate the simultaneous effects of layer thickness, delay time between spreading each layer, and print orientation of porous structures on the compressive strength and porosity of scaffolds. Two optimization methods were applied to obtain the optimal 3D parameter settings for printing tiny porous structures as a real BTE problem.

In this paper, we present a novel and practical system for taxi service analytics and visualization. By utilizing both real time and historical taxi data, the system conducts the estimation on region based passenger wait time for taxi, where recurrent neural network (RNN) and deep learning algorithms are used to build a predictive model. The built RNN-based predictive model achieves 73.3% overall accuracy, which is significantly higher than other classic models. Meanwhile, the system conducts the analytics on the taxi pickup hotspots and trip distributions. The experimental results show that around 97% trips are accurately identified and more than 200 hotspots in the city are successfully detected. Moreover, a novel three dimensional (3D) visualization together with the informative user interface is designed and implemented to ease the information access, and to help system users to understand the characteristics and gain insights of the taxi service",'IOS Press',"An intelligent system for taxi service : analysis, prediction and visualization",10.3233/AIC-170747,,"[{'title': 'AI Communications', 'identifiers': ['0921-7126', 'issn:0921-7126']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
296224748,2017-06,"Over the last decade, toxic events along the Mediterranean coast associated with exceptional harmful blooms of the dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata have increased in frequency and distribution, causing not only the death of marine organisms and human health problems, but also economic loss on the tourism and aquaculture industries. In order to reduce the burden of routine algal counting, an innovative automated, low-cost, opto-electronic system called OvMeter was developed. It is able to speed up the monitoring process and therefore it enables early warning of incipient harmful algal blooms. An ad-hoc software tool provides automated cell recognition, counting and real-time calculation of the final algal concentration. The core of dinoflagellate recognition relies on a localization step which takes advantage of the synergistic exploitation of 2D bright-field and quantitative phase microscopy images, and a classification phase performed by a machine learning algorithm based on Boosted Trees approach. The architectural design of the OvMeter device is presented here, together with a performance evaluation on sea samples",Springer,OvMeter: an automated 3D-integrated opto-electronic system for Ostreopsis cf. ovata bloom monitoring,10.1007/s10811-017-1069-7,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

228470486,2018-01-11T00:00:00,"The paper is text-based artwork, which is representing the initial conceptualization or contemplative phase of the media art and contemporary art performance and installation.The objective of the long term art project is to further examine the potential of engagement of the advanced technology within the context of artistic research and contemporary art practice, with the specific postulate that the potential product of the artwork is expected to be imperceptible.
The artistic research is referring to the philosophical and metaphysics idea that the alleged real reality cannot be perceived or defined via some concept. The question is, if it is so, than, is the art or the artist capable to successfully illustrate the undetectable real reality, even with the most advanced technological instruments employed.
The text-based contemporary artwork is partly referring to another segment, which can be also observed within the context of the contemporary art – text based computer adventure games. More specifically, the method implemented for establishing the artwork’s concept uses some aspects similar to those used in early text-based computer games.There are several stages in which the long-term artwork will progress.
The initial form is designed in such a manner which would confirm that this segment of artwork not only does serve as a fundament for the other parts to unfold, but is also autonomous and is already completed in terms of contemporary art. This stand is applicable to all the consecutive stages – each segment is both independent and contextual.The following stages would include the interactivity between the author, art audience, but also with the devices applied for the producing the artwork, like advanced technology instruments e.g. augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) devices, then interactive 3D technology, artificial intelligence (AI), plus the interactivity with the no-reality (reality in spiritual and philosophical contexts)",International Ambient Media Assocation (iAMEA),"AI, You're Fired!

275634114,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay communications networks have emerged as a new paradigm for implementing distributed services in microgrids due to their potential benefits: they are robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, and they can route messages even with a large number of nodes which are frequently entering or leaving from the network. However, current P2P systems have been mainly developed for file sharing or cycle sharing applications where the processes of searching and managing resources are not optimized. Locality algorithms have gained a lot of attention due to their potential to provide an optimized path to groups with similar interests for routing messages in order to get better network performance. This paper develops a fully functional decentralized communication architecture with a new P2P locality algorithm and a specific protocol for monitoring and control of microgrids. Experimental results show that the proposed locality algorithm reduces the number of lookup messages and the lookup delay time. Moreover, the proposed communication architecture heavily depends of the lookup used algorithm as well as the placement of the communication layers within the architecture. Experimental results will show that the proposed techniques meet the network requirements of smart microgrids even with a large number of nodes on stream.This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant ENE2015-64087-C2-2R.

287744239,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Eyes blinking and its movement can portray many reasons of the body and health state. Eyes can blink intentionally and sometimes randomly even in sleeping mode. Thus, the aim of this paper is to discover and observe the relationship between the frequency of eye blink and the level of eye muscle stress. The eye track data is fed directly into the electroencephalogram (EEG) record for parameter classification and identification. The EEG signal might have an artifact that has been analyzed and converted the observation into the mathematical library and repository software (HPC). The artificial neural network (ANN) is integrated with EEG digital data by the derivation of the mathematical modelling. The function of ANN is to train a large sparse digital data for future prediction of eye condition associated with the stress level. In order to validate the model and simulation, the numerical analysis and performance evaluation are compared to the real data set of eye therapy industry, IC Herbz Sdn Bhd.

The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

METHODS: We created a real-time training module, which can provide a standardized step by step guidance to robotic distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy procedures, ARMES. The short video clips of 20 key steps in the standardized procedure for robotic gastrectomy were created and integrated with TilePro™ software to delivery on da Vinci Surgical Systems (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA).

RESULTS: We successfully performed the robotic distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for patient with gastric cancer employing this new teaching method without any transfer errors or system failures. Using this technique, the total operative time was 197 min and blood loss was 50 mL and there were no intra- or post-operative complications.

Despite all efforts to develop sustainable monitoring systems, there is still a lack of low cost, continuous and real time devices that demonstrate potential for large-scale implementation in wide water distribution networks. The following work presents a study of a low-cost, optofluidic sensor, based on Trypthopan Intrinsic Fluorescence. The fluorospectrometry analysis performed (before sensor development) supports the existence of a measurable fluorescence output signal originating from the tryptophan contained within pathogenic bacteria. The sensor was mounted using a rapid prototyping technique (3D printing), and the integrated optical system was achieved with low-cost optical components. The sensor performance was evaluated with spiked laboratory samples containing E. coli and Legionella, in both continuous and non-continuous flow situations. Results have shown a linear relationship between the signal measured and pathogen concentration, with limits of detection at 1.4 × 103 CFU/mL. The time delay between contamination and detection of the bacteria was practically null. Therefore, this study supports the potential application of tryptophan for monitoring drinking water against water pathogens. View Full-Text

289704177,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This article presents a new deep learning approach for cardiac arrhythmia (17 classes) detection based on long-duration electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis. Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s.

275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

275646691,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Computer clusters are widely used platforms to execute different computational workloads. Indeed, the advent of virtualization and Cloud computing has paved the way to deploy virtual elastic clusters on top of Cloud infrastructures, which are typically backed by physical computing clusters. In turn, the advances in Green computing have fostered the ability to dynamically power on the nodes of physical clusters as required. Therefore, this paper introduces an open-source framework to deploy elastic virtual clusters running on elastic physical clusters where the computing capabilities of the virtual clusters are dynamically changed to satisfy both the user application's computing requirements and to minimise the amount of energy consumed by the underlying physical cluster that supports an on-premises Cloud. For that, we integrate: i) an elasticity manager both at the infrastructure level (power management) and at the virtual infrastructure level (horizontal elasticity); ii) an automatic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation agent that reduces the amount of powered on physical nodes using live migration and iii) a vertical elasticity manager to dynamically and transparently change the memory allocated to VMs, thus fostering enhanced consolidation. A case study based on real datasets executed on a production infrastructure is used to validate the proposed solution. The results show that a multi-elastic virtualized datacenter provides users with the ability to deploy customized scalable computing clusters while reducing its energy footprint.The results of this work have been partially supported by ATMOSPHERE (Adaptive, Trustworthy, Manageable, Orchestrated, Secure, Privacy-assuring Hybrid, Ecosystem for Resilient Cloud Computing), funded by the European Commission under the Cooperation Programme, Horizon 2020 grant agreement No 777154.Alfonso Laguna, CD.; Caballer Fernández, M.; Calatrava Arroyo, A.; Moltó, G.; Blanquer Espert, I.

\ud
First, we work with raw environmental audio, contaminated by noise and artefacts and containing calls that vary greatly in volume depending on the animal’s proximity to the microphone. \ud
\ud
Second, initial experimentation suggested that no single recognizer could dealwith the enormous variety of calls. Therefore, we developed a toolbox of generic recognizers to extract invariant features for each call type. Third, many species are cryptic and offer little data with which to train a recognizer.\ud
\ud
Many popular machine learning methods require large volumes of training and validation data and considerable time and expertise to prepare. Consequently we adopt bootstrap techniques that can be initiated with little data and refined subsequently. In this paper, we describe our recognition tools and present results for real ecological problems",Taylor & Francis,A toolbox for animal call recognition,10.1080/09524622.2011.648753,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Abstract



The first prototype of a photo-detection unit of the future KM3NeT neutrino telescope has been deployed in the deep waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This digital optical module has a novel design with a very large photocathode area segmented by the use of 31 three inch photomultiplier tubes. It has been integrated in the ANTARES detector for in-situ testing and validation. This paper reports on the first months of data taking and rate measurements. The analysis results highlight the capabilities of the new module design in terms of background suppression and signal recognition. The directionality of the optical module enables the recognition of multiple Cherenkov photons from the same40 K decay and the localisation of bioluminescent activity in the neighbourhood. The single unit can cleanly identify atmospheric muons and provide sensitivity to the muon arrival direction",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Deep sea tests of a prototype of the KM3NeT digital optical module,10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-3056-3,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
200047717,2011-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceIn this paper, we propose to create a rich database of syn- thetic time series of 3D echocardiography (US) images using simulations of a cardiac electromechanical model, in order to study the relationship between electrical disorders and kinematic patterns visible in medical images. From a real 4D sequence, a software pipeline is applied to create several synthetic sequences by combining various steps including motion tracking and segmentation. We use here this synthetic database to train a machine learning algorithm which estimates the depolarization times of each cardiac segment from invariant kinematic descriptors such as local displacements or strains. First experiments on the inverse electro- kinematic learning are demonstrated on the synthetic 3D US database and are evaluated on clinical 3D US sequences from two patients with Left Bundle Branch Block",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Synthetic Echocardiographic Image Sequences for Cardiac Inverse Electro-Kinematic Learning,10.1007/978-3-642-23623-5_63,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479953016,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The Tiber Valley Project aims to create a series of digital applications for 3D reconstructing, visualization and real time browsing of the ancient and current Tiber Valley landscape (particularly for the Villa dei Volusii and Lucus Feroniae areas), in four different historical phases. In this perspective, the first problem to face is the need for a valid methodology for ancient landscape ecosystem reconstruction, before dealing with monuments and building. On the basis of an intense multi-disciplinary discussion and the previous VH Lab experience in this field, in this article we are presenting a scheme for a standardized reconstruction procedure, where the landscape is built using all available sources and elevation data obtained by a photogrammetry process on historical pictures. Ecosystem areas are then calculated through GIS elaboration in GRASS-GIS environment, through a procedure which may be shared for any situation of historical landscape reconstruction, allowing the matching and the mathematical processing of geographical data aimed to the definition of different ecological areas (both in terms of natural vegetation and cultivated lands). Maps are then created to be imported in procedural landscape generation engines: the last part of the paper focuses on the lack of effective open source software in this field, and a possible proposal implementation in this sense1. Il progetto "" Valle del Tevere "" Il presente lavoro illustra la sperimentazione di una metodologia per la ricostruzione del paesaggio storico, con particolare riguardo agli aspetti di definizione delle diverse presenze vegetazionali e antropiche del territorio in determinate epoche del passato. Il caso di studio è rappresentato dal lavoro che l'Istituto per le Tecnologie Applicate ai Beni Culturali (ITABC) del CNR sta svolgendo nell'ambito del Programma "" Arcus "" , finalizzato alla creazione di un sistema integrato di conoscenza, valorizzazione e comunicazione del paesaggio culturale della Valle del Tevere (contesti archeologici, storico-arti-stici, naturalistici, antropici), in particolare dell'area compresa tra il Monte Soratte e Fiano Romano, in direzione N-S, e il tracciato della via Flaminia antica e Palombara Sabina, in direzione E-O. Il progetto prevede una variegata serie di prodotti finali, quali: – un'installazione di realtà virtuale ludico-educativa, caratterizzata da un sistema di natural interaction (interazione attraverso i movimenti del corpo), localizzata all'interno di un museo di Roma, quale porta privilegiata di accesso e promozione del territorio della Valle del Tevere; – una guida multimediale alla Villa dei Volusii e al sito di Lucus Feroniae, da fruire sia su mobile che presso il Museo di Lucus Feroniae; – una guida alla Riserva del Tevere-Farfa, per smartphone o tablet, da fruire durante la visita all'area naturalistica; – un'installazione multimediale-filmica dedicata alla Riserva naturale del Teve-re-Farfa e destinata alle scuole, da fruire nel Museo del Fiume di Nazzano; – un sito web sul paesaggio culturale, basato su un sistema informativo geo-grafico in 3D e dedicato al pubblico di turisti, studiosi, operatori, scuole. Il lavoro comporta una ricostruzione fotorealistica del paesaggio natu-rale e antropico rispetto alle seguenti fasi cronologiche: – fase preistorica (ricostruzione della storia geologica dell'area, formazione della Valle del Tevere e dell'alveo fluviale, tra 3 milioni di anni fa e 12.000 anni fa); – fase pre-romana (focalizzata sull'Età del Ferro e sul periodo Orientaliz-zante); – fase romana (focalizzata, in particolare, sul periodo augusteo); – fase medievale (focalizzata, in particolare, sul XII secolo); – fase contemporanea",All'Insegna del giglio,"Verso una metodologia condivisa per l'analisi del paesaggio antico: il Progetto ""Valle del Tevere""",,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1120-6861', '1120-6861']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
323317300,2011-04-08T00:00:00,"[EN] This paper proposes a methodology for the recognition of surgical maneuvers in laparoscopic surgical interventions. The aim is to create an interface between the surgeon and a surgical robotic assistant for two arms of minimally invasive surgery procedures. The proposed interface receives information about the positioning of surgical tools of the surgeon using 3D sensors and the recognition system facilitates the current maneuver is completed. Therefore, the recognition system maneuvers that supports this interface requires a library of models of maneuvers to work. The models chosen to represent the surgical maneuvers are Hidden Markov Models. To validate the proposed methodology, we have developed a series of in-vitro experiments.[ES] Este trabajo propone una metodología para el reconocimiento de maniobras quirúrgicas en intervenciones de cirugía laparoscópica.

427084953,2013-09-13T00:00:00,"This  paper  demonstrates  a  new  alternative  way  in  estimating seismically thin-bed (below-tuning) thickness. Initial thickness is built by bandpass filtering the amplitude display of a zero-phase seismic. The filter removes the  non  minimum  and  or  non  maximum  and  left  the  maximum  and  or  the minimum of seismic amplitude. The unresolved below-tuning thickness is then corrected  by  zero-INTENS-difference  (z-i-d)  attribute.  INTENS  is  integrated energy  spectra,  an  attribute  which  can  be  derived  from  spectral  analysis.  z-i-d attribute is zero difference of INTENS between the seismic and its synthetic. The method  generates  INTENS  difference  profile  by  subtracting  seismic  INTENS and its synthetic INTENS iteratively. The iteration is controlled by dipole space shifting from  distance to closer or  vice  versa.  The true thickness is derived  by locating z-i-d which laid in INTENS different profile. It has found that, for free noise  true  seismic  and  perfect-wavelet  (a  wavelet  which  only  approximately similar  with  wavelet  which  constructing  the  true  seismic)  synthetic  seismic,  in INTENS  different  profile,  the  z-i-d  location  always  corresponds  to  true  dipole space or thickness. The method could resolve all thickness of a wedge-modeled seismic with three different dominant frequencies. When the synthetic seismic is constructed with imperfect wavelet, slightly different analysis is needed to locate z-i-d  attribute  and  the  result  is  not  as  perfect  as  when  perfect  wavelet constructing synthetic seismic. A quiet similar result is got when the method is implemented  for  noisy  wedge-modeled  seismic.  Bad  thickness  estimation  is resulted  for  20%  noise  seismic.  The  method  algorithm  is  extended  for  similar dipole polarity model and multilayer model to bring the method to real seismic data  nearer.  The  extension  is  done  by  estimating  thickness  of  every  layer  of  a stacked-wedge-modeled  seismic. The algorithm then generalized for estimating layers  thickness  with  several  thickness  combinations.  The  method  was  able  to delineate shallow channel of Stratton Field by providing good pseudo-acousticimpedance (pseudo AI) map",'The Institute for Research and Community Services (LPPM) ITB',Combination of Minimum-Maximum (m-m) Attribute and Zero-INTENS-Difference (z-i-d) Attribute for Estimating Seismically Thin-Bed Thickness,10.5614/itbj.eng.sci.2011.43.2.1,https://core.ac.uk/download/427084953.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Organizational mechanisms can be introduced into a Multi-Agent System with the aim of influencing the behavior of agents populating it to achieve their goals in a proper way. In this paper, we propose to model organizational mechanisms by means of artifacts, which are non-proactive entities used by agents. Artifacts were presented within the Agents & Artifacts conceptual framework, and that present good advantages for coordinating agents' environments. We put forward a formal model that defines how organizational mechanisms can be designed by using artifacts theory. We validate the approach by presenting a case study focused on a real health care domain problem. Additionally, the Artifacts for Organizational Mechanisms are compared with some different proposed artifacts. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.This work is supported by TIN2009-13839-C03 and PROMETEO/2008/051 projects of the Spanish government, CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 under grant CSD2007-00022, and the COST Action IC0801.Esparcia García, S.; Argente Villaplana, E.; Centeno, R.; Hermoso, R.

To obviate this issue, we propose the use of widely available hardware with a strong supply chain: a cellphone with a hands-free kit. In particular, we focus on the use of the audio channel to determine heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in order to provide a first level screening system for infection. This article presents preliminary work performed on a gold standard database and a cellphone platform. Results indicate that HR and HRV can be accurately assessed from acoustic recordings of heart sounds using only a cellphone and hands-free kit. Heart sound analysis software, which can run on a standard cellphone in real time, has been developed that detects S1 heart sounds with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a positive predictivity of 88.4%. Evaluation of data recorded from cellphones demonstrates that the low-frequency response (<100 Hz) is key to the success of heart sound analysis on cellphones.

Taking advantage of the multidisciplinary structure of the research team, contributions have been proposed in the fields of image processing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cognitive psychology and ethology. In image processing, we have contributed to predictive models of the gaze fixations in a driving task, namely, looking for road signs, proposing a computational model of top-down visual attention. In artificial intelligence, a simple computational model of visual attention was proposed and implemented in an agent-based microscopic traffic simulation model. In virtual reality, the blink frequency was proposed in order to assess the relevance of driving simulators in terms of the driver's mental workload. In cognitive psychology, the visual conspicuity of powered two wheels was assessed on a driving simulator, leading to recommendations about their lighting system design; another contribution gave evidence that oculomotor patterns can reveal crossing decisions at crossroads. In cognitive ethology, a joint work is in progress with the CEREMA in order to study oculomotor patterns at crossroads in a field test, thanks to a dedicated vehicle.Cet article présente un ensemble de recherches récentes et en cours dans le domaine de l’attention visuelle, menées au laboratoire LEPSIS de l’IFSTTAR.

148440389,2007-01-01T00:00:00,"One primary goal in rescue robotics is to deploy a team of robots for coordinated victim search after a disaster. This requires robots to perform subtasks, such as victim detection, in real-time. Human detection by computationally cheap techniques, such as color thresholding, turn out to produce a large number of false-positives. Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can be utilized to combine the local evidence of multiple weak classifiers in order to improve the detection rate. However, inference in MRFs is computational expensive. In this paper we present a novel approach for the genetic optimizing of the building process of MRF models. The genetic algorithm determines offline relevant neighborhood relations with respect to the data, which are then utilized for generating efficient MRF models from video streams during runtime. Experimental results clearly show that compared to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier, the optimized MRF models significantly reduce the false-positive rate. Furthermore, the optimized models turned out to be up to five times faster then the non-optimized ones at nearly the same detection rate.Artificial Intelligence & Integrated Computer System",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Genetic MRF Model Optimization for Real-Time Victim Detection in Search and Rescue,10.1109/IROS.2007.4399006,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The dynamics of the GCF is based on the estimation of the final state related to each alternative via a net of concepts and some evolution functions that define how the initial state will evolve given a certain alternative. The GCF scores the alternatives computing their expected utility and so, it requires a probability value associated to each possible final state. The estimated values of the criteria that characterize a state are bounded using fuzzy sets, which provide an easy method for assigning probability values. The GCF considers that it could be necessary to carry out simultaneously more than one alternative to mitigate a fire emergency.[ES] Este trabajo propone un Sistema Computacional de Ayuda a la Decisión, el Gestor de Crisis de Fuego (GCF), diseñado para ayudar a una persona a tomar decisiones en tiempo real en situaciones de emergencia, concretamente, en caso de incendio en un edificio.

A real-time cellular neural network (CNN) emulator (RTCNNP-v2) is used for the realization of the image processing algorithms, whose regular, flexible and reconfigurable infrastructure simplifies the prototyping process. For future work, the post-processing part of the CASA system is proposed to be implemented on the same FPGA device as software, using either a soft or hard processor core.

This quantity is much smaller than the number of the parameters in the network and it does not depend on the number of input variables. In this paper, we present numerical studies on both real and simulated data sets assuring the validity of e.d.f. in a general framework. Results confirm that e.d.f. performs more reliably than the total number W of adaptive parameters - which are usually assumed equal to the degrees of freedom of the model in common statistical softwares - for analyzing and comparing neural models. Numerical studies also point out that e.d.f. works well in estimating the error variance and constructing approximate confidence intervals. We then propose a comparison among some model selection criteria and results show that for neural networks GCV performs slightly better.

The analysis of the Compañía de Jesús facade has tried to cope this duality using the power of reverse modeling and texturing, the latter is really important due to the function of the photographic images into accurate description of materials and colours, as well as in the creation of 3D models using UV mapping tools, which are a very advanced field of the computer graphic software.Nell’ ambito delle ricerche scientifiche sui beni culturali le tecniche di modellazione 3D applicate ai dati provenienti da campagne di rilevamento scanner laser stanno assumendo sempre più importanza.

11276235,2011-01-01T00:00:00,"Various micro-devices have been used to assess single cell mechanical properties. Here, we designed and implemented a novel, mechanically actuated, two dimensional cell culture system that enables a measure of cell stiffness based on quantitative functional imaging of cell-substrate interaction. Based on parametric finite element design analysis, we fabricated a soft (5 kPa) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cell substrate coated with collagen-I and fluorescent micro-beads, thus providing a favorable terrain for cell adhesion and for substrate deformation quantification, respectively. We employed a real-time tracking system that analyzes high magnification images of living cells under stretch, and compensates for gross substrate motions by dynamic adjustment of the microscope stage. Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to quantify substrate deformation beneath and surrounding the cell, leading to an estimate of cell stiffness based upon the ability of the cell to resist the applied substrate deformation. Sensitivity of the system was tested using chemical treatments to both ""soften"" and ""stiffen"" the cell cytoskeleton with either 0.5 μg/ml Cytochalasin-D or 3% Glutaraldehyde, respectively. Results indicate that untreated osteosarcoma cells (SAOS-2) exhibit a 1.5 ± 0.7% difference in strain from an applied target substrate strain of 8%. Compared to untreated cells, those treated with Cyochalasin-D passively followed the substrate (0.5 ± 0.5%, p < 0.001), whereas Glutaraldehyde enhanced cellular stiffness and the ability to resist the substrate deformation (2.9 ± 1.6%, p < 0.001). Nano-indentation testing showed differences in cell stiffness based on culture treatment, consistent with DIC findings.

Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments. In this paper, a first implementation of the decision making system and the learning process is implemented on a social robot showing an improvement in robot's performance.

This article presents a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) to assist in the vegetation classification in a vision-based landing site detection system for an unmanned aircraft. We propose a heterogeneous computing architecture and an OpenCL implementation of a PCNN feature generator. Its performance is compared across OpenCL kernels designed for CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms. This comparison examines the compute times required for network convergence under a variety of images to determine the plausibility for real-time feature detection.

Its solution defines the sequence of collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation-aid systems or auto-steering for agricultural vehicles and machines, is able to provide accurate data to make a reliable bale collecting planning. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approach to address the BCP pursuing resource optimization such as minimizing non-productive time, fuel consumption, or distance travelled. The algorithmic route generation provides the basis for a navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a set of instances similar to those found in real situations. In particular, comparative results show an average improving of a 16% from those obtained by previous heuristics.This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government (research project AGL2010-15334).Gracia Calandin, CP.; Diezma Iglesias, B.; Barreiro Elorza, P.

203190541,2011-08-31,"AbstractObjective(s)Patient-specific simulated rehearsal (PsR) is a technological advance within the domain of endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation. It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p=0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p=0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p=0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p=0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p=0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p=0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p=0.49) and NOTSS (p>0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.ConclusionsPart- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention.

36204612,2007-01-01T00:00:00,"One primary goal in rescue robotics is to deploy a team of robots for coordinated victim search after a disaster. This requires robots to perform subtasks, such as victim detection, in real-time. Human detection by computationally cheap techniques, such as color thresholding, turn out to produce a large number of false-positives. Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can be utilized to combine the local evidence of multiple weak classifiers in order to improve the detection rate. However, inference in MRFs is computational expensive. In this paper we present a novel approach for the genetic optimizing of the building process of MRF models. The genetic algorithm determines offline relevant neighborhood relations with respect to the data, which are then utilized for generating efficient MRF models from video streams during runtime.

Agents provide suitable flexibility to give support to implied heterogeneity in cyber-physical systems. Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Control (QoC) parameters are commonly utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the communications and the control loop. Agents can use the quality measures to take a wide range of decisions, like suitable placement on the control node or to change the workload to save energy. This article describes the architecture of a multi agent system that provides support to QoS and QoC parameters to optimize de system. The architecture uses a Publish-Subscriber model, based on Data Distribution Service (DDS) to send the control messages. Due to the nature of the Publish-Subscribe model, the architecture is suitable to implement event-based control (EBC) systems. The architecture has been called FSACtrlThe architecture described in this article is a part of the coordinated project SIDIRELI: Distributed Systems with Limited Resources.

226191101,2008-01-01,"In this article we propose an effective method for a user-dependant voice command (small vocabulary) recognition system based on the combination of genetic algorithms and the Fisher's Linear Discriminant Ratio (FLDR). A genetic algorithm here is used to search in the frequency domain of the voice for those sub-bands whose energy is discriminant enough so as to distinguish between at least two different classes, and at the same time, being able to appropriately agglomerate the different utterances of one word of the vocabulary in a compact class. Once the sub-bands have been evolutionary selected, its energy is represented in feature vectors; in this way, very few samples of each voice command are required to build each words' model; moreover, this is a convenient method for feature selection. Real time implementation was done in a DSP TMS320LF2407 using elliptic bandpass filters -one per sub-band- with floating point representation. Encouraging results were obtained.

286729123,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"Simulating large-scale models of biological motion perception is challenging, due to the required memory to store the network structure and the computational power needed to quickly solve the neuronal dynamics. A low-cost yet high-performance approach to simulating large-scale neural network models in real-time is to leverage the parallel processing capability of graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on this approach, we present a two-stage model of visual area MT that we believe to be the first large-scale spiking network to demonstrate pattern direction selectivity. In this model, component-direction- selective (CDS) cells in MT linearly combine inputs from V1 cells that have spatiotemporal receptive fields according to the motion energy model of Simoncelli and Heeger. Pattern-direction-selective (PDS) cells in MT are constructed by pooling over MT CDS cells with a wide range of preferred directions. Responses of our model neurons are comparable to electrophysiological results for grating and plaid stimuli as well as speed tuning. The behavioral response of the network in a motion discrimination task is in agreement with psychophysical data. Moreover, our implementation outperforms a previous implementation of the motion energy model by orders of magnitude in terms of computational speed and memory usage. The full network, which comprises 153,216 neurons and approximately 40 million synapses, processes 20 frames per second of a 40∈×∈40 input video in real-time using a single off-the-shelf GPU. To promote the use of this algorithm among neuroscientists and computer vision researchers, the source code for the simulator, the network, and analysis scripts are publicly available. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York","eScholarship, University of California",Efficient spiking neural network model of pattern motion selectivity in visual cortex,,https://core.ac.uk/download/286729123.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This work presents an application driven digital hardware exploration where we implement realtime, isolated digit speech recognition using a Liquid State Machine (a recurrent neural network of spiking neurons where only the output layer is trained). First we test two existing hardware architectures, but they appear to be too fast and thus area consuming for this application. Then we present a scalable, serialised architecture that allows a very compact implementation of spiking neural networks that is still fast enough for real-time processing.

210554287,2008-01-01T08:00:00,"Multi-agent teaming is a key research field of multi-agent systems. BDI (Belief, Desire, and Intension) architecture has been widely used to solve complex problems. The theory of joint behavior has been widely used to solve the team level optimisation problems. Due to the inherent complexity of real-time and dynamic environments, it is often extremely complex and difficult to formally specify the joint behavior of the team a priori. This paper presents a role-based BDI framework to facilitate cooperation and coordination problems. This BDI framework is extended and based on the commercial agent software development environment known as JACK Teams. A real-time 2D simulation environment known as soccerbots has been used to investigate the difficulties of multi-agent teaming.

275594362,2013-06-01T00:00:00,"Thanks to the built in intelligence (deployment of new intelligent devices and sensors in places where historically they were not present), the Smart Grid and Microgrid paradigms are able to take advantage from aggregated load forecasting, which opens the door for the implementation of new algorithms to seize this information for optimization and advanced planning. Therefore, accuracy in load forecasts will potentially have a big impact on key operation factors for the future Smart Grid/Microgrid-based energy network like user satisfaction and resource saving, and new methods to achieve an efficient prediction in future energy landscapes (very different from the centralized, big area networks studied so far). This paper proposes different improved models to forecast next day's aggregated load using artificial neural networks, taking into account the variables that are most relevant. In particular, seven models based on the multilayer perceptron will be proposed, progressively adding input variables after analyzing the influence of climate factors on aggregated load.

275591397,2011-01-01T00:00:00,"In this paper we present a new algorithm for solving polynomial
equations based on the Taylor series of the inverse function of a polynomial,
fP(y). The foundations of the computing of such series have been previously
developed by the authors in some recent papers, proceeding as follows: given
a polynomial function y = P(x) = a0 + a1x +···+ amxm, with ai ∈ R, 0 ≤ i ≤
m, and a real number u so that P 
(u)  = 0, we have got an analytic function
fP(y) that satisfies x = fP(P(x)) around x = u. Besides, we also introduce a
new proof (completely different) of the theorems involves in the construction
of fP(y), which provide a better radius of convergence of its Taylor series,
and a more general perspective that could allow its application to other kinds
of equations, not only polynomials. Finally, we illustrate with some examples
how fP(y) could be used for solving polynomial systems. This question has
been already treated by the authors in preceding works in a very complex
and hard way, that we want to overcome by using the introduced algorithm in
this paper.Moreno Flores, J.; Saiz Martinez, A. (2011). Inverse functions of polynomials and its applications to initialize the search of solutions of polynomials and polynomial systems.

53020779,2006-02-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThis paper describes an objective measurement method designed to assess the perceived quality for digital videos. The proposed approach can be used either in the context of a reduced reference quality assessment or in the more challenging situation where no reference is available. In that way, it can be deployed in a QoS monitoring strategy in order to control the end-user perceived quality. The originality of the approach relies on the very limited computation resources which are involved, such a system could be integrated quite easily in a real time application. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that allows a continuous time scoring of the video. Experiments conducted on different MPEG-2 videos, with bit rates ranging from 2 to 6 Mbits/s, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. More specifically, a linear correlation criterion, between objective and subjective scoring, ranging from 0.90 up to 0.95 has been obtained on a set of typical TV videos in the case of a reduced reference assessment. Without any reference to the original video, the correlation criteria remains quite satisfying since it still lies between 0.85 and 0.90, which is quite high with respect to the difficulty of the task, and equivalent and more in some cases than the traditional PSNR, which is a full reference measurement",'Oxford University Press (OUP)',No reference and reduced reference video quality metrics for end to end QoS monitoring,10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.2.289,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

78067765,2014-11-01T00:00:00,"We present a new method for planning footstep placements for a robot walking on uneven terrain with obstacles, using a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware.

31676248,2007-07-01T00:00:00,"International audienceTightening European standards on fuel consumption and pollutant emissions reduction lead to a sophistication of engine concepts and associated control. Since few years, downsizing (reduction of the engine displacement) appears as a major way to achieve those requirements for spark ignition engines. Efficientperformance and drivability can be then achieved with a direct injection downsized engine with turbocharging and Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT). One of the major issues of the torque-oriented control is in-cylinder mass observation and control. To have an efficient torque response, the in-cylinder trapped mass, adjusted by the throttle and the waste gate, must be controlled with accuracy according to performance and drivability requirements. Depending on admission and exhaust pressures, the twin VCT will allow to control in-cylinder burned gases rate to reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, and air scavenging to improve transient speed response. Another major issue is in-cylinder trapped mass and air scavenging prediction for AFR control. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to achieve those engine control issues. The first challenge is to design accurate observers for non-measurable variables (in-cylinder burned gases and trapped air mass). The method is based on a complex high frequency 0D engine model, which has been validated on a large range of engine operating points and transient operations based on test bed results. Then, this model permits to design and learn open-loop nonlinear static observers of in-cylinder masses (based on neural network). The static and dynamic behavior of high frequency 0D engine model allows to achieve design of dynamic and closed-loop in-cylinder mass observation and prediction, multivariable and non-linear control of air path according to in-cylinder mass trajectory (trapped air mass & recirculated gases rate). Then, the complete engine control can be developed and validated on simulation and on a real time Software-In-the-Loop platform based on high frequency 0D engine model, before a complete validation and calibration on test bed. Finally, the complete torque-oriented engine control has been integrated on vehicle. From 0D engine model, a complete vehicle model has been set on real-time platform in order to validate engine control integration and design vehicle layout. The major issue is then supervision of engine control set points (torque, AFR, efficiency) according to engine states (start, idle, driver request, cut-off) and warm-up strategies",'EDP Sciences',Engine Control of a Downsized Spark Ignited Engine : from Simulation to Vehicle,10.2516/ogst:2007057,https://core.ac.uk/download/31676248.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

196689363,2011-11-01T00:00:00,"Autonomy is a prime issue on robotics field and it is closely related to decision making. Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments. In this paper, a first implementation of the decision making system and the learning process is implemented on a social robot showing an improvement in robot's performance.

82797003,2007-10-23,"ObjectivesWe tested a newly developed 4-dimensional (4D) right ventricular (RV) analysis method for computing RV volumes for both 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) images.BackgroundAsymmetry and the anatomical complexity of the RV make accurate determination of RV shape and volume difficult.MethodsThirty patients, 14 with grossly normal cardiac anatomy and 16 with major congenital heart disease, were studied at the same visit with both 3D echocardiography (echo) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for RV size and function. Ultrasound images were acquired on a Philips 7500 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts) with a matrix-array transducer (real-time 3D echo) with full volume sweeps from apical and subcostal views. Sagittal, 4-chamber, and coronal views were derived for contour detection (all 12 to 24 slices). The MR images were acquired with a 3-T MRI magnet with segmented cine-loop gradient echo sequences in short- and rotated long-axis views to cover the RV inflow, body, and outflow tract. The RV volumes were analyzed with the new software applicable to 3D echo MR images.ResultsNew software aided delineation of the RV free wall, tricuspid valve, RV outflow tract, and apex on 3D echo volumes. Although there was a slightly higher variability measuring right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and volumes obtained by US compared with MRI, both imaging methods showed closely correlated results. The RVEF was measured with 4% variability for US and 5% variability for MRI with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.91. The RV end-diastolic volume was measured at 70.97 ± 15.0 ml with 3D US and at 70.06 ± 14.8 ml with MRI (r = 0.99), end-systolic volume measured 39.8 ± 10.4 ml with 3D US and 39.1 ± 10.2 ml with MRI (r = 0.98).ConclusionsThe new RV analysis software allowed validation of the accuracy of 4D echo RV volume data compared with MRI",American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Materials and Methods: 50 lesions previously detected at mammography or conventional US were evaluated by means of CEUS and MRI. Contrast-enhanced examinations were performed with a dedicated equipment (Esatune, Esaote, Genoa, Italy), before and after injection of 4.8 ml of Sonovue (Bracco, Milan, Italy). MRI was conducted with a 1.5 T equipment (Siemens Vision Plus, Erlangen, Germany) with bilateral dedicated superficial coil, on T2w STIR and 3D Flash T1w before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes after the administration of contrast agent (Gd-DTPA, 1.5 ml/ Kg). Wash-in and wash out curves were assessed for both procedures. A specific sonographic quan-, tification software (Qontrast, Bracco, Milan, Italy), based off pixel by pixel signal intensity over time, was used to obtain contrast-enhanced sonographic perfusion maps for each lesion. Mc Nemar test was then calculated. Results: 24 invasive ductal carcinomas, 18 fibroadenomas, 4 fibro-cystic dysplasias, 1 mucin ous carcinoma, 1 invasive ducto-lobularcarcinoma, 1 intraductal florid papillomatosis and 1 phylloides tumour were diagnosed. Contrastenhanced sonographic patterns correlated well with those provided by MRI. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of US were: 69.2%, 66.7%, and 68%, respectively. According to the different contrast enhancement patterns and the resulting perfusion maps, all the malignant lesions and 9 out of 12 benign lesions were correctly diagnosed, thus resulting in 87.5% of specificity and 100% of sensitivity. Regarding the specificity, there is no difference between US and CEUS with McNemar (p=0.18). Regarding sensitivity, the difference between contrast-enhanced US and US is significant as calculated with McNemar test (p=0.013). The three lesions which were incorrectly classified as malignant were two hypervascularised fibroadenomas in young women and a phylloides tumour.

15035381,2007-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: The accuracy, reproducibility, and test-retest reliability of 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography (3DE) with 3D reconstruction (3DR) and real-time (RT) imaging (RT 3DE) exceed that of 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE). However, image quality with RT 3DE is inferior to 2DE and we sought to determine whether this justified ongoing use of 3DR. Methods: Unselected patients (n = 30, 22 men, age 66 ± 7 years) presenting to the echocardiography laboratory for left ventricular (LV) evaluation were studied with 2DE and RT 3DE; 3DR images were obtained using external localization. The 3D measurements and reconstructions were obtained offline. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained using true free induction, steady state precession during breath hold and 3D volumes and ejection fraction (EF) were measured using 3D software. A separate cohort of 20 patients (13 men, age 60 ± 12 years) was measured for test-retest variation. Results: All echocardiographic measures underestimated LV volumes and EF compared with MRI, but this was least with RT 3DE. End-diastolic volume by MRI (168 ± 54 mL) was underestimated by RT 3DE (-15 ± 31, P = .02), 3DR (-26 ± 33, P < .01), and 2DE (-57 ± 40, P < .01). Similarly, end-systolic volume by MRI (86 ± 50 mL) was underestimated by RT 3DE (-15 ± 31, P = .02), 3DR (-26 ± 33, P < .01), and 2DE (-57 ± 40, P < .01). However, EF measurements were similar with each method. Test-retest variation was less and interobserver and intraobserver correlations were better with RT 3DE for volumes and EF, compared with 3DR and 2DE.

196680311,2007-10-01T00:00:00,"One of the main obstacles in applying AI planning techniques to real problems is the difficulty to model the domains. Usually, this requires that people that have developed the planning system carry out the modeling phase since the representation depends very much on a deep knowledge of the internal working of the planning tools. On some domains such as business process reengineering (BPR), there has already been work on the definition of languages that allow non-experts entering knowledge on processes into the tools. We propose here the use of one of such BPR languages to enter knowledge on the organisation processes to be used by planning tools. Then, planning tools can be used to semi-automatically generate business process models.
As instances of this domain, we will use the workflow modeling tool SHAMASH, where we have exploded its object oriented structure to
introduce the knowledge through its user-friendly interface and, using a translator transform it into predicate logic terms. After this conversion,
real models can be automatically generated using a planner that integrates planning and scheduling, IPSS.

Obiettivi del contributo e teorie di riferimento



Obiettivo di questo paper è ragionare sul ruolo che i social media esercitano - in accordo con i contenuti mediali tradizionali - nella definizione del senso di appartenenza sociale e partecipazione culturale dei soggetti alla vita quotidiana.



In particolare, oggetto del nostro lavoro sono le pratiche partecipative messe in campo dagli utenti dei social media a ridosso di Vieni via con me, un programma televisivo andato in onda sulla Rai nel mese di novembre 2010, per 4 puntate. 

Il prodotto si è configurato come vero e proprio media event (Dayan e Katz, 1992), per diverse ragioni:

In primo luogo, ha dato vita ad una vastissima copertura mediale, sia attraverso mezzi tradizionali che social media, che si è sviluppata precedentemente e successivamente alla messa in onda, in relazione  alla valenza politica dei contenuti proposti (letti in chiave ideologico-oppositiva al Governo) e rispetto alla scelta dei conduttori e degli ospiti del programma (uno dei quali è il noto scrittore Roberto Saviano, autore di Gomorra, un libro denuncia sulla camorra, apertamente schierato in senso anti-Berlusconiano).

Un altro aspetto degno di nota è senza dubbio il risultato in termini di dati di ascolto registrati durante le 4 puntate: il sistema di rilevazione metrico Auditel (people meter) ha segnalato medie di share nel prime time pari al 25,48%, 30%, 21,21% 31,60% 29,17% , e un ascolto medio intorno ai 9 milioni; pur in una fase di costante contrazione degli ascolti della tv generalista (free e/o servizio pubblico), il programma  si è posizionato al 7 posto tra i più visti in Italia nel 2010 e ha riportato davanti agli schermi tv pubblici giovani, ormai orientati verso altre forme di consumo culturale. 

Infine, per la prima volta in maniera significativa in Italia, è emerso, a ridosso di un programma certamente non di intrattenimento o di fiction, un fenomeno consistente di fruizione on line e just in time del prodotto (Baym), attraverso social media che ne hanno rilanciato contenuti e commenti, coltivando un senso di appartenenza e di comunità e una ritualità performativa innovativa tra le audience.



Nell’ambito di una più ampia riflessione sul rapporto tra utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie, proiezioni identitarie e articolazione delle relazioni sociali (si vedano, tra gli altri, Boase e Wellman 2006, Buckingham 2008, Castells 2001, Castells et al., 2006, Wellman 2004), il presente lavoro fa riferimento, in modo specifico, all’ampio dibattito sviluppato intorno ai concetti di cultura convergente, culture partecipative, user generated content (si vedano in primo luogo Jenkins 2006 e Jenkins et al. 2009; Burgess e Green, 2009), recuperando parte della letteratura sul fandom e, in particolare, sulle produzioni dei fan (si vedano tra gli altri Jenkins 2006, Hills 2002). Faremo inoltre riferimento alla più recente letteratura sulle nuove pratiche di fruizione televisiva, che vedono una crescente integrazione tra la programmazione broadcast e forme di appropriazione dei contenuti da parte delle audience che prevedono un crescente uso dei social media – e di Twitter1 in particolare (Gripsrud, 2010; Kackman et al, 2011; Rappaport, 2011). Attraverso il commento e la rielaborazione in tempo reale dei contenuti broadcast, le audience connesse costituiscono specifiche comunità immaginate (Anderson, 1983) legate a specifici contenuti mediali. Il programma è stato recepito come un'occasione di riflessione politica, con forti connotazioni anti governative, al punto che la sua stessa fruizione è stata interpretata, da molti degli spettatori attivi sui social media, come un momento di civic engagement (sul tema della nuova sfera pubblica si vedano Castells 2008 e 2009; sul rapporto tra social media e civic engagement si veda Johnson et al, 2011).



Obiettivi di ricerca



1.Valutare l’impatto del prodotto a livello sociale e culturale, cercando di individuare le ragioni di un successo non solo televisivo (e fuori dai canoni televisivi) e rintracciando le connessioni tra l’engagement nei confronti del programma tv e l’eventuale civic engagement (Silverstone, 1999) dei soggetti verso la sfera politica e pubblica.

2.Individuare le ritualità del consumo del contenuto mediale e la costruzione grassroot dell’evento, indagando e descrivendo le connessioni esistenti tra il momento squisitamente televisivo e le pratiche discorsive e produttive delle audience, così come si sono concretizzate attraverso differenti piattaforme di comunicazione on line.

3.Cogliere i tratti e le pratiche di una participatory culture (Jenkins et al., 2009) e individuare i segni della costruzione di una comunità immaginata (Anderson, 1983) tra i pubblici dell’evento.

4.Leggere il ruolo dei social network sites in Italia come preparatori ad una nuova forma di partecipazione politica (in linea con quanto emerso recentemente in Nord Africa o a ridosso delle elezioni amministrative di maggio 2011) 



Metodologia utilizzata



Dal punto di vista della metodologia di ricerca, è stato scelto un approccio blended, etnografico e netnografico (Hine, 2000; Markham & Baym, 2009; Kozinets, 2010):



1.Interviste in profondità (30) ai pubblici del programma, selezionati sulla base dei dati di ascolto registrati dal people meter (Auditel) sulle motivazioni del successo del prodotto, sul vissuto sociale e culturale dell’intervistato, il contesto e le pratiche della sua fruizione televisiva, l’approccio al programma, la percezione e il giudizio del prodotto o di alcune sue parti, l’eventuale utilizzo di Internet e dei social media prima, durante o dopo la visione, la valenza politica del consumo culturale.

2.Analisi quanti-qualitativa dei Tweet registrati in rete in relazione al programma #Vieni via con me# (26.000), per cronologia (just in time o pre-post visione), tipologia di contenuti e aree semantiche di riferimento. 

3.Analisi quanti-qualitativa dei video caricati su Youtube in relazione al programma, in termini di cronologia (just in time o post visione), tipologia dei video (cut and paste, o new editing), visualizzazioni e commenti.



Principali risultati della ricerca



La ricerca ha prodotto interessanti esiti in termini di individuazione di:

nuove modalità ibride di fruizione dei contenuti video attraverso diverse piattaforme 

Costruzioni di comunità e rituali on line in relazione a contenuti mediali off line

The product is configured as a real media event (Dayan and Katz, 1992), for several reasons: First, it has created a huge media coverage, both through traditional means and social media, which has been previously developed and after the broadcast, in relation to the political significance of the proposed contents (beds in key ideological and oppositional to the government) and with respect to the choice of conductors and guest of the program (one of which is the well-known writer Roberto Saviano, author of Gomorrah, a book report on the Camorra, openly deployed in an anti-Berlusconi). Another noteworthy aspect is undoubtedly the result in terms of audience figures recorded during the 4 episodes: the detection system metric Auditel (people meter) reported average audience share in prime time equal to 25.48%, 30%, 21,21% 31,60% 29,17%, and an average audience of around 9 million, while in a state of constant contraction of the plays of generalist TV (free and / or public service), the program was ranked seventh place among the most viewed in Italy in 2010 and brought in front of the tv screens young audiences, now oriented towards other forms of cultural consumption. Finally, for the first time significantly in Italy, it was found, next to a program certainly not entertainment or fiction, a phenomenon consisting of fruition online and just in time of the product (Baym), through social media that relaunched content and comments, cultivating a sense of belonging and community rituals and performative innovative audience.Nell between the 'context of a wider reflection on the relationship between use of new technologies, projections of identity and articulation of social relations (see, among others, Boase and Wellman 2006 Buckingham in 2008, Castells 2001, Castells et al., 2006 Wellman 2004), this paper refers, specifically, the broad debate developed around the concepts of convergence culture, participatory cultures , user generated content (see first Jenkins 2006 Jenkins et al., 200",,"Vieni via con me.

15507450,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"Introduction

Several scheduling algorithms have been developed for constraint satisfaction in real-time systems. Optimality is difficult

to reach, and the problem becomes NP-hard when a large set of constraints must be satisfied. To solve this type of

problem, approximate methods are used, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Neural networks have demonstrated

their efficiency in optimization problems. They converge in a reasonable time if the number of neurons and connections

between neurons can be limited. Another limitation concerns the need to regularly re-initialize the

network when it converges towards a stable state which does not belong to the set of valid solutions. On the other hand,

embedded applications are usually implemented on complex System-on-Chip (SoC) which are built around

heterogeneous processing units. On such platform, task instantiation on execution resources is realized by using the

scheduling service of an OS. As each task can be defined for several targets, this service must decide, on-line, on which

resource the task should be instantiated.

In this work, we propose an on-line scheduling based on a neural network for heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC)

architectures with a limited number of neurons...Les technologies de conception de circuits intégrés permettent aujourd’hui de concevoir des systèmes

complets et complexes sur une seule et même puce. On parle alors de systèmes sur puce, ou encore de

System-on-Chip (SoC). Ces systèmes ont en charge l’exécution d’applications complexes, composées de

nombreuses tâches, le tout étant orchestré par un système d’exploitation dont l’un des rôles principaux

consiste à ordonnancer les tâches et à les allouer aux ressources de calcul.

L’une des particularités de ces architectures concerne l’hétérogénéité des cibles d’exécution qui rend le

problème de l’ordonnancement particulièrement délicat et complexe. Notons de plus que le critère temps réel

des applications s’exécutant sur ce type de plate forme nécessite l’étude de solutions d’ordonnancement

efficaces, notamment en terme de temps de calcul.

Dans ce papier, nous présentons nos travaux de modélisation du problème de l’ordonnancement pour

architectures multi-processeurs hétérogènes par utilisation de réseaux de neurones. Des travaux précédents

ont montré qu’une structure de réseaux de neurones suivant le modèle de Hopfield peut être définie pour

ordonnancer des tâches sur une architecture homogène. Une extension à ces travaux a montré qu’il était

possible de prendre en compte l’hétérogénéité de l’architecture mais au prix d’un grand nombre de neurones

supplémentaires. De plus, ces solutions posent un problème de convergence important qui se traduit par un

temps de convergence assez long et le besoin de ré-initialiser le réseau de neurones lorsque celui-ci se

stabilise dans un état qui n’est pas une solution valide.

Pour contrer ces principaux inconvénients, nous proposons une nouvelle structure basée sur la mise en place

de neurones inhibiteurs. Ces neurones particuliers permettent de limiter le nombre de neurones nécessaires à

la modélisation et permettent surtout de se passer de ré-initialisations pour atteindre la convergence.

Nous illustrons l’apport de notre proposition en comparant les solutions classiques à base de réseaux de

neurones de Hopfield avec notre proposition. Nous montrons que le nombre de neurones est assez largement

réduit et surtout qu’il n’est plus nécessaire de ré-initialiser le réseau pour assurer sa convergence, ce qui

laisse envisager une implémentation efficace de ce type de structure","GRETSI, Saint Martin d'Hères, France",Real-Time Scheduling on Heterogeneous SoC Architectures Using A Neural Network,,https://core.ac.uk/download/15507450.pdf,"[{'title': 'Traitement du signal', 'identifiers': ['0765-0019', 'issn:0765-0019']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Taking advantage of the multidisciplinary structure of the research team, contributions have been proposed in the fields of image processing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cognitive psychology and ethology. In image processing, we have contributed to predictive models of the gaze fixations in a driving task, namely, looking for road signs, proposing a computational model of top-down visual attention. In artificial intelligence, a simple computational model of visual attention was proposed and implemented in an agent-based microscopic traffic simulation model. In virtual reality, the blink frequency was proposed in order to assess the relevance of driving simulators in terms of the driver's mental workload. In cognitive psychology, the visual conspicuity of powered two wheels was assessed on a driving simulator, leading to recommendations about their lighting system design; another contribution gave evidence that oculomotor patterns can reveal crossing decisions at crossroads. In cognitive ethology, a joint work is in progress with the CEREMA in order to study oculomotor patterns at crossroads in a field test, thanks to a dedicated vehicle.Cet article présente un ensemble de recherches récentes et en cours dans le domaine de l’attention visuelle, menées au laboratoire LEPSIS de l’IFSTTAR.

32325828,2015-07-01T00:00:00,"In this work, we propose the use of the neural gas (NG), a neural network that uses an unsupervised Competitive Hebbian Learning (CHL) rule, to develop a reverse engineering process. This is a simple and accurate method to reconstruct objects from point clouds obtained from multiple overlapping views using low-cost sensors. In contrast to other methods that may need several stages that include downsampling, noise filtering and many other tasks, the NG automatically obtains the 3D model of the scanned objects. To demonstrate the validity of our proposal we tested our method with several models and performed a study of the neural network parameterization computing the quality of representation and also comparing results with other neural methods like growing neural gas and Kohonen maps or classical methods like Voxel Grid. We also reconstructed models acquired by low cost sensors that can be used in virtual and augmented reality environments for redesign or manipulation purposes. Since the NG algorithm has a strong computational cost we propose its acceleration. We have redesigned and implemented the NG learning algorithm to fit it onto Graphics Processing Units using CUDA. A speed-up of 180× faster is obtained compared to the sequential CPU version.This work was partially funded by the Spanish Government DPI2013-40534-R grant",'Elsevier BV',3D model reconstruction using neural gas accelerated on GPU,10.1016/j.asoc.2015.03.042,https://core.ac.uk/download/32325828.pdf,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The aim of the study was to detect if right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction assessed by real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) could predict patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with greater functional impairment in response to cardiopulmonary exercise.

METHODS AND RESULTS:

Seventy chronic heart failure patients with DCM (55.5 ± 9.1 years; 48 males; 30 ischemic; New York Heart Association Class III: 48) underwent both left ventricular (LV) and RV analysis by RT3DE. Postprocessing software provided data of RT3DE systolic dyssynchrony index of 16 LV segments (systolic dyssynchrony index [SDI]) and of both LV and RV ejection fraction. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed in a subgroup of 40 DCM patients to confirm RT3DE measurements. All the patients underwent also bicycle cardiopulmonary exercise test with evaluation of oxygen consumption (VO2) peak% (percentage of the predicted value), VE/VCO2 slope, and circulatory power (CP). Mean LV ejection fraction was 29.8 ± 4.6%. RT3DE LV SDI index was 8.4.4 ± 4.2, and RV ejection fraction was 51.3 ± 4.6%. By cardiopulmonary test, mean VO2 peak was 15.2 ± 4.4 mL·kg·min, and mean CP was 2.1 ± 0.8. By univariable analyses, significant correlations were detectable between SDI index and VO2 peak% (r = -0.56; P < .0001) and peak CP (r = -0.48; P < .0005). Also RV ejection fraction directly correlated with VO2 peak% (r = 0.58; P < .0001) and inversely with VE/VCO2 slope (r = -0.44; P < .001). By multivariable analysis, SDI index (β coefficient = -0.46; P < .001) and 3D RV ejection fraction (β coefficient = 0.42; P < .001) emerged as the only independent determinants of VO2 peak% during cardiopulmonary test.

CONCLUSIONS:

Increased LV electromechanical dyssynchrony and impaired RV function in DCM patients are independently associated with worse ability to perform aerobic exercise",,Right ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular dyssynchrony by 3D echo correlate with functional impairment in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
43491761,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

226069866,2010,"Introduzione. Il gene dell’Interleuchina 6 (IL-6) nell’uomo è localizzato sul braccio corto del cromosoma 7 (7p21) e ha un polimorfismo G→C in posizione –174 del promotore. La presenza di una sequenza di AT altamente ripetute in corrispondenza della 3’“flanking region” del gene dell’IL-6 dà luogo al polimorfismo delle “variable number of tandem repeats” (VNTR). La presenza dell’allele C (640 bp) nella regione VNTR è stata associata con una ridotta attività dell’IL-6. È stato anche riportato che il polimorfismo G→C in posizione –174 del promotore è associato con una ridotta espressione genica e con ridotti livelli plasmatici di IL-6. Precedenti studi condotti su popolazioni anziane hanno messo in evidenza che i soggetti geneticamente predisposti a produrre elevati livelli di IL-6, ad esempio maschi omozigoti per l’allele G del promotore, hanno una ridotta capacità di raggiungere l’estrema longevità.

Scopo dello studio. Scopo dello studio è stato valutare la presenza di un’associazione fra i polimorfismi della regione VNTR dell’IL-6 e l’estrema longevità, in una popolazione di centenari pugliesi, e valutare la possibile interazione fra gli alleli della regione VNTR e gli alleli dell’Apolipoproteina E (APOE).

Materiali e metodi. Sono stati studiati 155 soggetti pugliesi, di cui 61 centenari (13 maschi e 48 femmine, età media 100 ± 2 anni). Il gruppo di controllo di 94 soggetti (32 maschi e 62 femmine, età media 52 ± 18 anni) era costituito da volontari sani osservati fra il giugno 2007 e aprile 2008. A tutti i soggetti sono stati prelevati 2 cc circa di sangue da cui è stato estratto il DNA per l’analisi del genotipo dell’APOE e dei genotipi della regione VNTR dell’IL-6. L’analisi del polimorfismo della regione VNTR è stata eseguita mediante PCR e successiva elettroforesi su gel di agarosio 3%. L’analisi del polimorfismo dell’APOE è stata eseguita mediante Real-Time PCR – Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) system – e successiva analisi delle curve di melting. È stata eseguita un’analisi mediante test del χ2 per valutare la presenza di eventuali differenze fra le frequenze alleliche della regione VNTR nei centenari rispetto ai controlli. Per l’analisi dei dati è stato usato il software statistico STATA SE versione 8.0. Risultati. È stata rilevata una sovra-rappresentazione statisticamente significativa dell’allele B (680bp) della regione VNTR nei soggetti di controllo rispetto ai centenari (allele B vs allele C, allele D e allele A Pearson χ2 = 6.31, Bonferroni p < 0.05; Odds Ratio: 0.56, IC 95%: 0.35–0.88, Bonferroni p-value < 0.05); Non sono state rilevate differenze statisticamente significative per la distribuzione degli alleli A (760bp), C (640bp) e D (760bp) fra centenari e controlli (allele D vs allele C, allele B e allele A Pearson χ2 = 0.59, Bonferroni p = 1.76; allele C vs allele D, allele B e allele A Pearson χ2 = 4.8, Bonferroni p = 0.11; allele A vs allele C, allele B e allele D Pearson χ2 = 0.1, Bonferroni p = 3.03). A causa dell’esiguità del campione, non è stato possibile calcolare l’odds ratio per valutare un’eventuale associazione, nei centenari, fra gli alleli del VNTR, e gli alleli dell’APOE. Conclusioni. Il nostro studio ha messo per la prima volta in evidenza come i polimorfismi della regione VNTR dell’IL-6 possano giocare un ruolo nella longevità. Infatti, precedenti studi condotti per verificare il ruolo del gene

dell’IL6 gene nella longevità nell’uomo, hanno interessato esclusivamente il polimorfismo IL6 -174 G/C del promotore. I risultati del nostro studio suggeriscono che la presenza dell’allele B della regione VNTR dell’IL6 allele B potrebbe determinare un incremento dell’espressione del gene dell’IL6, magari aumentandone la produzione di mRNA, e quindi i livelli sierici dell’IL-6. Mentre precedenti studi hanno dimostrato come la presenza dell’allele C

della regione VNTR dell’IL-6 può essere associate con livelli sierici di IL6 più bassi, il che può essere vantaggioso nel raggiungimento dell’età avanzata, non ci sono attualmente studi di associazione genotipo-fenotipo che possono dimostrare un effetto della presenza dell’allele B del VNTR sui livelli sierici

di IL6. I risultati del nostro studio vanno comunque interpretati con cautela. Si tratta infatti di un analisi di tipo trasversale su di un numero esiguo di

centenari, il che ha costituito un limite per la potenza statistica dello studio, non consentendo di raggiungere conclusioni definitive. Inoltre, non è stato

possibile valutare la possibile interazione fra gli alleli della regione VNTR e gli alleli dell’Apolipoproteina E (APOE) a causa dell’esiguità del campione,

e del numero assai basso di soggetti portatori dell’allele ε4- ad ε2- nei centenari e nei controlli. Infine, non è stata valutata una possibile associazione

fra gli alleli della regione VNTR dell’IL6 e i livelli sierici di IL6, per definire una spiegazione biologica del ruolo svantaggioso della presenza dell’allele B

della regione VNTR nel raggiungimento dell’estrema longevità. Solo studi di tipo longitudinale specificamente disegnati per verificare il ruolo degli alleli

della regione VNTR dell’IL6 sulla longevità potranno fornire evidenze più significative per un ulteriore comprensione del ruolo di questi polimorfismi

53832591,2010,"It is known that one of the most critical issues for the implementation of a fully automatic processing dedicated to the detection of oil spills from SAR imagery is the extraction of the oil spill candidate. In fact, the segmentation of the image is the first of three necessary steps, the other two being the characterization of the extracted black spot by using a set of features and the classification between oil spill and look-alike. In this paper we investigate an unsupervised neural network approach for automatically extracting oil spill candidates from ERS and ENVISAT SAR images. The technique is based on the use of Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks (PCNN) which is a relatively novel technique based on models of the visual cortex of small mammals. When applied to image processing, it yields a series of binary pulsed signals, each associated to one pixel or to a cluster. In literature, interesting results have been already reported by several authors in applications of this model to image segmentation, including, in few cases, the use of satellite data. The architecture of PCNN is rather simpler than most other neural network implementations. PCNN do not have multiple layers and receive input directly from the original image, forming a resulting “pulse” image. The network consists of multiple nodes coupled together with their neighbors within a definite distance, forming a grid (2D-vector). The PCNN neuron has two input compartments: linking and feeding. The feeding compartment receives both an external and a local stimulus, whereas the linking compartment only receives a local stimulus. When the internal activity becomes larger than an internal threshold, the neuron fires and the threshold sharply increases. Afterward, it begins to decay until once again the internal activity becomes larger. This process gives rise to the pulsing nature of PCNN, forming a wave signature which is invariant to rotation, scale, shift or skew of an object within the image. This study discusses the use of PCNN technique in a fully automatic chain for oil spill detection from SAR images. The objects segmented by the PCNN are successively processed by a more standard Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, which provides the classification response between real oil spill and look-alike. The performance yielded by the PCNN-MLP chain is evaluated and critically discussed for a set of ERS-SAR and ENVISAT ASAR images. The application of the methodology to the very-high resolution SAR images taken by COSMO-Skymed and TerraSAR-X satellites will be also considered",,Pulse coupled neural networks for automatic oil spill detection from satellite SAR images,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p=0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p=0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p=0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p=0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p=0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p=0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p=0.49) and NOTSS (p>0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.ConclusionsPart- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention. This finding makes a patient-specific rehearsal more efficient and may increase the feasibility of implementation of this technology into medical practice",European Society for Vascular Surgery.

We present a description of an interface, referred to as a Homunculus, which allows an experimenter to explore complex systems through immersive virtual reality technology. We describe an initial application under development where the Encephalon, a biologically motivated neural architecture, is used to control a robotics system. Encephalon modules are represented in the Homunculus as 3¬D icons. Information flow between modules of the neural network is represented as graphical animations.

234909889,2014,"State-of-the-art aeronautic Low Pressure gas Turbines (LPTs) are already

characterized by high quality standards, thus they offer very narrow margins of

improvement. Typical design process starts with a Concept Design (CD) phase,

defined using mean-line 1D and other low-order tools, and evolves through a

Preliminary Design (PD) phase, which allows the geometric definition in

details. In this framework, multidisciplinary optimization is the only way to

properly handle the complicated peculiarities of the design. The authors

present different strategies and algorithms that have been implemented

exploiting the PD phase as a real-like design benchmark to illustrate results.

The purpose of this work is to describe the optimization techniques, their

settings and how to implement them effectively in a multidisciplinary

environment. Starting from a basic gradient method and a semi-random second

order method, the authors have introduced an Artificial Bee Colony-like

optimizer, a multi-objective Genetic Diversity Evolutionary Algorithm [1] and a

multi-objective response surface approach based on Artificial Neural Network,

parallelizing and customizing them for the gas turbine study. Moreover, speedup

and improvement arrangements are embedded in different hybrid strategies with

the aim at finding the best solutions for different kind of problems that arise

201948697,2007-10-23,"ObjectivesWe tested a newly developed 4-dimensional (4D) right ventricular (RV) analysis method for computing RV volumes for both 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) images.BackgroundAsymmetry and the anatomical complexity of the RV make accurate determination of RV shape and volume difficult.MethodsThirty patients, 14 with grossly normal cardiac anatomy and 16 with major congenital heart disease, were studied at the same visit with both 3D echocardiography (echo) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for RV size and function. Ultrasound images were acquired on a Philips 7500 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts) with a matrix-array transducer (real-time 3D echo) with full volume sweeps from apical and subcostal views. Sagittal, 4-chamber, and coronal views were derived for contour detection (all 12 to 24 slices). The MR images were acquired with a 3-T MRI magnet with segmented cine-loop gradient echo sequences in short- and rotated long-axis views to cover the RV inflow, body, and outflow tract. The RV volumes were analyzed with the new software applicable to 3D echo MR images.ResultsNew software aided delineation of the RV free wall, tricuspid valve, RV outflow tract, and apex on 3D echo volumes. Although there was a slightly higher variability measuring right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and volumes obtained by US compared with MRI, both imaging methods showed closely correlated results. The RVEF was measured with 4% variability for US and 5% variability for MRI with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.91. The RV end-diastolic volume was measured at 70.97 ± 15.0 ml with 3D US and at 70.06 ± 14.8 ml with MRI (r = 0.99), end-systolic volume measured 39.8 ± 10.4 ml with 3D US and 39.1 ± 10.2 ml with MRI (r = 0.98).ConclusionsThe new RV analysis software allowed validation of the accuracy of 4D echo RV volume data compared with MRI",American College of Cardiology Foundation.

A number of measures have been applied in order to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities in roads, i.e., implementation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based on image processing. In this paper, a real time speed supervisor based on road sign recognition that can work both in urban and non-urban environments is presented. The system is able to recognize 135 road signs, belonging to the danger, yield, prohibition obligation and indication types, and sends warning messages to the driver upon the combination of two pieces of information: the current speed of the car and the road sign symbol. The core of this paper is the comparison between the two main methods which have been traditionally used for detection and recognition of road signs: template matching (TM) and neural networks (NN). The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches will be shown and commented. Additionally we will show how the use of well-known algorithms to avoid illumination issues reduces the amount of images needed to train a neural network.The work reported in this article has been partly funded by the Spanish Government by the grants

58785997,2007-10-01T00:00:00,"One of the main obstacles in applying AI planning techniques to real problems is the difficulty to model the domains. Usually, this requires that people that have developed the planning system carry out the modeling phase since the representation depends very much on a deep knowledge of the internal working of the planning tools. On some domains such as business process reengineering (BPR), there has already been work on the definition of languages that allow non-experts entering knowledge on processes into the tools. We propose here the use of one of such BPR languages to enter knowledge on the organisation processes to be used by planning tools. Then, planning tools can be used to semi-automatically generate business process models.
As instances of this domain, we will use the workflow modeling tool SHAMASH, where we have exploded its object oriented structure to
introduce the knowledge through its user-friendly interface and, using a translator transform it into predicate logic terms. After this conversion,
real models can be automatically generated using a planner that integrates planning and scheduling, IPSS.

77020831,2015-04-21T00:00:00,"Cascade support vector machines (SVMs) are optimized to efficiently handle problems, where the majority of the data belong to one of the two classes, such as image object classification, and hence can provide speedups over monolithic (single) SVM classifiers. However, SVM classification is a computationally demanding task and existing hardware architectures for SVMs only consider monolithic classifiers. This paper proposes the acceleration of cascade SVMs through a hybrid processing hardware architecture optimized for the cascade SVM classification flow, accompanied by a method to reduce the required hardware resources for its implementation, and a method to improve the classification speed utilizing cascade information to further discard data samples. The proposed SVM cascade architecture is implemented on a Spartan-6 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform and evaluated for object detection on 800 × 600 (Super Video Graphics Array) resolution images. The proposed architecture, boosted by a neural network that processes cascade information, achieves a real-time processing rate of 40 frames/s for the benchmark face detection application. Furthermore, the hardware-reduction method results in the utilization of 25% less FPGA custom-logic resources and 20% peak power reduction compared with a baseline implementation",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Embedded Hardware-Efficient Real-Time Classification With Cascade Support Vector Machines,10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2428738,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', 'identifiers': ['2162-2388', 'issn:2162-2388']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

156944177,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"MOTIVATION: Detecting positive selection in genomic regions is a recurrent topic in natural population genetic studies. However, there is little consistency among the regions detected in several genome-wide scans using different tests and/or populations. Furthermore, few methods address the challenge of classifying selective events according to specific features such as age, intensity or state (completeness). RESULTS: We have developed a machine-learning classification framework that exploits the combined ability of some selection tests to uncover different polymorphism features expected under the hard sweep model, while controlling for population-specific demography. As a result, we achieve high sensitivity toward hard selective sweeps while adding insights about their completeness (whether a selected variant is fixed or not) and age of onset. Our method also determines the relevance of the individual methods implemented so far to detect positive selection under specific selective scenarios. We calibrated and applied the method to three reference human populations from The 1000 Genome Project to generate a genome-wide classification map of hard selective sweeps. This study improves detection of selective sweep by overcoming the classical selection versus no-selection classification strategy, and offers an explanation to the lack of consistency observed among selection tests when applied to real data. Very few signals were observed in the African population studied, while our method presents higher sensitivity in this population demography.

213404357,2014-03-14T20:12:19,"We developed a composite machine-learning based algorithm, called ANGLOR, to predict real-value protein backbone torsion angles from amino acid sequences. The input features of ANGLOR include sequence profiles, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. In a large-scale benchmarking test, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the phi/psi prediction is 28°/46°, which is ~10% lower than that generated by software in literature. The prediction is statistically different from a random predictor (or a purely secondary-structure-based predictor) with p-value <1.0×10−300 (or <1.0×10−148) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. For some residues (ILE, LEU, PRO and VAL) and especially the residues in helix and buried regions, the MAE of phi angles is much smaller (10–20°) than that in other environments. Thus, although the average accuracy of the ANGLOR prediction is still low, the portion of the accurately predicted dihedral angles may be useful in assisting protein fold recognition and ab initio 3D structure modeling.Funding: The project is supported in part by the Alfred P.

31282417,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThe prediction of Autoignition (AI) delay is an essential prerequisite to account for abnormal combustions (e.g. knock or super knock) that can appear in Internal Combustion (IC) engines. In this paper, a simple model called Ignition to Propagation Reduced Scheme (IPRS) is proposed to add AI predictions in reduced chemical schemes, which are classically used to compute in-cylinder combustion in the context of Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The IPRS principle is to use a single two-reaction reduced scheme and adapt the pre-exponential factor of the fuel oxidation reaction as a function of the temperature: one value is used at low temperatures to correctly predict AI delays and an other one can be used at higher temperatures, where heat release occurs, to keep the flame propagation properties of the chemical scheme. After a first section that introduces the model, Perfectly Stirred Reactors and 1D flames simulations are used to verify that: (1) the modification of the pre-exponential constant of the Arrhenius law at low temperature does not alter the propagation properties of the reduced scheme and (2) this modification is sufficient to accurately predict AI delays. In a following section this model is implemented in a 3D LES solver to compute AI in a simplified IC engine for which results with complex chemistries are available and may be used as a reference for comparison. In the last section this model is applied to a highly downsized engine to illustrate its ability to predict AI in real engine configurations",'Elsevier BV',A methodology based on reduced schemes to compute autoignition and propagation in internal combustion engines,10.1016/j.proci.2014.06.053,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
288530118,2010,"It is known that one of the most critical issues for the implementation of a fully automatic processing dedicated to the detection of oil spills from SAR imagery is the extraction of the oil spill candidate. In fact, the segmentation of the image is the first of three necessary steps, the other two being the characterization of the extracted black spot by using a set of features and the classification between oil spill and look-alike. In this paper we investigate an unsupervised neural network approach for automatically extracting oil spill candidates from ERS and ENVISAT SAR images. The technique is based on the use of Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks (PCNN) which is a relatively novel technique based on models of the visual cortex of small mammals. When applied to image processing, it yields a series of binary pulsed signals, each associated to one pixel or to a cluster. In literature, interesting results have been already reported by several authors in applications of this model to image segmentation, including, in few cases, the use of satellite data. The architecture of PCNN is rather simpler than most other neural network implementations. PCNN do not have multiple layers and receive input directly from the original image, forming a resulting “pulse” image. The network consists of multiple nodes coupled together with their neighbors within a definite distance, forming a grid (2D-vector). The PCNN neuron has two input compartments: linking and feeding. The feeding compartment receives both an external and a local stimulus, whereas the linking compartment only receives a local stimulus. When the internal activity becomes larger than an internal threshold, the neuron fires and the threshold sharply increases. Afterward, it begins to decay until once again the internal activity becomes larger. This process gives rise to the pulsing nature of PCNN, forming a wave signature which is invariant to rotation, scale, shift or skew of an object within the image. This study discusses the use of PCNN technique in a fully automatic chain for oil spill detection from SAR images. The objects segmented by the PCNN are successively processed by a more standard Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, which provides the classification response between real oil spill and look-alike. The performance yielded by the PCNN-MLP chain is evaluated and critically discussed for a set of ERS-SAR and ENVISAT ASAR images. The application of the methodology to the very-high resolution SAR images taken by COSMO-Skymed and TerraSAR-X satellites will be also considered",,Pulse coupled neural networks for automatic oil spill detection from satellite SAR images,,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Un forte sdegno investiva inoltre una classe politica percepita come altamente corrotta in un Paese in crisi (nel 2009 \u2013 c\u2019erano stati ben 730 processi pendenti a carico di amministratori pubblici, con il primato del PSOE con 264 casi di corruzione aperti, seguito dai 200 casi del PP).

Il paper si interrogher\ue0 sulle modalit\ue0 del processo di istituzionalizzazione del movimento spagnolo, sul suo percorso di trasformazione organizzativa (con un particolare focus sui processi decisionali adottati) e programmatica, sull\u2019evoluzione delle priorit\ue0 politiche, sulla formulazione dei discorsi rivolti all\u2019elettorato e sul tipo di comunicazione adottata, sugli elementi distintivi che ne mantengono l\u2019identit\ue0 anche dopo la problematica scelta delle alleanze, sulle analogie e le differenze rispetto al tradizionale discorso culturale della sinistra. Si tenter\ue0 infine di comparare quanto sta accadendo in Spagna con un pi\uf9 generale processo di cambiamento che sta investendo movimenti e partiti negli altri Paesi europei.The elements that outraged the members of the 15M movement were connected to the austerity policy, to the record of unemployment, to the increase of uncertainty among young people with temporary works, to the restructuring measures and reduction of the welfare state (implemented by the Government Zapatero on ECB and IMF pressure, and supported by the Popular Party). A strong indignation also invested a political class perceived as highly corrupt in a country in crisis (in 2009 - there were 730 pending trials against public officials, with the primacy of the PSOE with 264 corruption cases opened, followed by 200 cases of PP). Already in June 2011, there was the Europeanization of protest and a changing in the social and  generational base of the movement. The reported problems are exacerbated by the Rajoy government. They blame the lack of credibility of the political class, subservient to the policies imposed by the decision-making centers of international capitalism that make similar the majority and the opposition choices. Claiming the right of operating different choices, Podemos propose new models aspiring to stop the degradation process of representative democracy through the introduction of forms of participatory and deliberative democracy, against the bipartisanship the major parties accused of having ""kidnapped democracy"".

The paper will question the process of institutionalization of the Spanish movement, studying its organizational transformation path (with a particular focus on the adopted decision-making processes), its policy priorities, its communication, its distinctive characteristics that maintain the identity. The paper analyzes the problem of choosing alliances and the similarities and differences comparing to the traditional discourses of the left wing parties.

275613405,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"The inclusion of embedded sensors into a networked system provides useful
information for many applications. A Distributed Control System (DCS) is one of the
clearest examples where processing and communications are constrained by the client s
requirements and the capacity of the system. An embedded sensor with advanced
processing and communications capabilities supplies high level information, abstracting
from the data acquisition process and objects recognition mechanisms. The implementation
of an embedded sensor/actuator as a Smart Resource permits clients to access sensor
information through distributed network services. Smart resources can offer sensor services
as well as computing, communications and peripheral access by implementing a self-aware
based adaptation mechanism which adapts the execution profile to the context. On the
other hand, information integrity must be ensured when computing processes are
dynamically adapted. Therefore, the processing must be adapted to perform tasks in a
certain lapse of time but always ensuring a minimum process quality. In the same way,
communications must try to reduce the data traffic without excluding relevant information.
The main objective of the paper is to present a dynamic configuration mechanism to adapt
the sensor processing and communication to the client s requirements in the DCS. This
paper describes an implementation of a smart resource based on a Red, Green, Blue, and

326993009,2009-11-26T00:00:00,"Recent research into the acquisition of spoken language has stressed the importance of learning through embodied linguistic interaction with caregivers rather than through passive observation. However the necessity of interaction makes experimental work into the simulation of infant speech acquisition difficult because of the technical complexity of building real-time embodied systems. In this paper we present KLAIR: a software toolkit for building simulations of spoken language acquisition through interactions with a virtual infant. The main part of KLAIR is a sensori-motor server that supplies a client machine learning application with a virtual infant on screen that can see, hear and speak. By encapsulating the real-time complexities of audio and video processing within a server that will run on a modern PC, we hope that KLAIR will encourage and facilitate more experimental research into spoken language acquisition through interaction.

53069361,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"Актуальность исследования обусловлена необходимостью разработки программных средств слежения за объектами в реальном масштабе времени. Цель работы: Создание алгоритма слежения за объектом в кадре в реальном масштабе времени. Методы исследования: Параллельная реализация сигмоидальной нейронной сети на графическом процессоре, замеры временных характеристик параллельного алгоритма и его оптимизация. Результаты: Предложена реализация на графическом процессоре (GPU) нейросетевого алгоритма слежения за объектом, спецификой которого является использование при обучении нейронной сети задачника, устанавливающего однозначное соответствие обрабатываемого кадра в видеопотоке координатам центра объекта в кадре. Благодаря использованию GPU удается решить задачу слежения в реальном масштабе времени (25 кадров в секунду) при размерах обрабатываемого кадра до 1280?960. Алгоритм основан на использовании многослойного персептрона и имеет ряд параметров, которые определены экспериментально. Одним из таких параметров является число нейронов скрытого слоя. В связи с реализацией алгоритма на GPU рассмотрены числа нейронов, кратные 16. В экспериментах установлено, что 16 и 32 нейрона не могут обеспечить даже малой степени запоминания образов, 48 нейронов справлялись с обучением только на малых обучающих выборках, 64 нейрона обеспечили хорошую степень запоминания образов и скорость работы. Дальнейшее увеличение числа нейронов приводит только к уменьшению скорости работы нейронной сети и ее обучения. Также заслуживает внимания частота, с которой нужно брать кадры из видеозаписи, чтобы эффективно обучить нейронную сеть. Экспериментально установлено, что на частоте выборки одного кадра из десяти сумма максимальных отклонений по обеим координатам равна 50 при размерах объекта 300?300; дальнейшее увеличение частоты кадров лишь замедляет процесс обучения, не давая существенного выигрыша в качестве. Получены ускорения процесса слежения в 10 раз по сравнению с центральным процессором персонального компьютера. Процесс обучения нейронной сети ускорился в среднем только в 2 раза. Это обусловлено необходимостью транспонирования матриц весов при реализации обучения нейронной сети на GPU. Для реализации параллельного алгоритма использована программно-аппаратная архитектура CUDA, позволяющая производить вычисления с использованием графических процессоров NVIDIA, поддерживающих технологию GPGPU (произвольных вычислений на видеокартах). Для предварительной обработки изображений и вывода информации использовалась библиотека компьютерного зрения OpenCV.The urgency of the discussed issue is caused by the need to provide software for tracking objects in real time. The main aim of the study: to create an object-tracking algorithm in the frame in real time. The methods used in the study: parallel implementation of the sigmoid neural network on the GPU, measuring the temporal characteristics of the parallel algorithm and its optimization. The results: The authors have proposed implementation of a neural network algorithm on graphic processor (GPU) for tracking an object in a video frame. The specific character of the algorithm is the use of a training set which establish correspondence between the video frame and the object center coordinates in this frame when training a neural network. Owing to GPU application the tracking problem can be solved in real time (25 frames per second) at the processed frame sizes up to 1280?960. The algorithm is based on the use of multilayer perceptron and has a number of parameters, which are determined experimentally. One of such parameters is the number of the hidden layer neurons. Due to the algorithm implementation on GPU the authors considered the number of neurons multiple 16. It was determined experimentally that 16 and 32 neurons cannot provide even a small degree of memorizing images, 48 neurons cope with learning only small training samples, and 64 neurons provided a good degree of memorizing images and speed. Further increase in the number of neurons results only in reducing speed of the neural network functioning and its training. The frequency which is required for taking pictures from a video to train effectively a neural network is worth noticing as well. It is found out experimentally that at a sampling rate of one frame of ten, the sum of the maximum deviations in coordinates is 50, when the object size is 300?300; further increase of the frame rate slows down the process of training without significant gain in quality. The authors obtained the tracking accelerating by 10 times in comparison with the CPU of a personal computer. The neural network training is accelerated only 2 times on average. This is caused by the need to transpose the weight matrices when implementing the neural network training on the GPU. To implement the parallel algorithm, the hardware and software architecture CUDA is used. It allows computation on graphics processors NVIDIA, supporting GPGPU technology (general purpose computations on GPU). For preliminary image processing and data output the computer vision library OpenCV is used",Томский политехнический университет,Neural network parallel algorithm for real-time object tracking,,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1684-8519', '1684-8519']}]",core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
159325307,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"—In this paper, we present an alternative approach to neuromorphic systems based on multi-level resistive memory (RRAM) synapses and deterministic learning rules. We demonstrate an original methodology to use conductive-bridge RAM (CBRAM) devices as, easy to program and low-power, binary synapses with stochastic learning rules. New circuit architecture, programming strategy and probabilistic STDP learning rule for two different CBRAM configurations 'with-selector (1T-1R)' and 'without-selector (1R)' are proposed. We show two methods (intrinsic and extrinsic) for implementing probabilistic STDP rules. Fully unsupervised learning with binary synapses is illustrated with the help of two example applications: (i) real-time auditory pattern extraction (inspired from a 64-channel silicon cochlea emulator) and (ii) visual pattern extraction (inspired from the processing inside visual cortex). High accuracy (audio pattern sensitivity>2, video detection rate>95%) and low synaptic-power dissipation (audio 0.55µW, video 74.2µW) are shown. The ro-bustness and impact of synaptic parameter variability on system performance is also analyzed",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Bio-inspired stochastic computing using binary CBRAM synapses,10.1109/TED.2013.2263000,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
323091063,2013-04-07T00:00:00,"[ES] Los sistemas con conmutación de modos se definen como aquéllos que pueden exhibir diferente comportamiento dinámico en función del estado en que se encuentran. Pueden por tanto ser descritos por un conjunto finito de subsistemas dinámicos y una lógica que rige la conmutación entre ellos. Una alternativa para su control es la arquitectura multi-controlador con supervisión ya que permite utilizar controladores de modo diferentes y alcanzar así múltiples objetivos de control. Pero la conmutación de controladores suele tener como consecuencia la aparición de saltos o transitorios derivados que pueden ser inaceptables. Este tipo de sistemas y problemática son frecuentes en diferentes áreas de aplicación industrial, en donde la tecnología de control más utilizada es el Controlador Lógico Programable (PLC). Es por ello que el objetivo de este trabajo es presentar un método de diseño e implementación de un mecanismo de transferencia sin salto (BT) en una arquitectura multi-modo y multi-bucle para sistemas con conmutación de modos, en PLC y en conformidad con el estándar IEC 61131-3. La estrategia BT se basa en que controladores de modos candidatos a conmutar realicen un seguimiento a los controladores activos, siendo la detección del estado de operación actual y de los posibles estados siguientes, clave en la definición de la forma de ejecución de los algoritmos de control que componen la arquitectura. Se presentan también los pasos del diseño de la arquitectura completa así como resultados experimentales que validan la arquitectura.[EN] Switched mode systems are defined as those represented by a finite set of linear subsystems and a set of logic rules orchestrating the switching among them. A set of dynamic subsystems together with a logical system that orchestrates the switching among them could be used in order to describe it. An alternative to control them is a supervisory multi-mode controller architecture that allows to meeting multiple control objectives. But switching can consequently derived in bumps or undesirable transient responses. This type of problem is commonly encountered in several industrial application fields, where the Programmable Logic Controller (PLCs) is the most used technology. This paper describes a methodology for the design and the implementation of Bumpless Transfer (BT) mechanisms within multi-rate control architecture for switched mode systems, to be implemented in PLC following the IEC 61131-3 standard. The BT strategy is based on to make controllers which are candidate to switch track to active controllers. By detecting the system state and the feasible next states, the supervisor decides the way in which the different controllers of the architecture execute. The steps to design the complete architecture are presented and experimental results that validate the architecture are shown.MCYT y FEDER a través de los proyectos DPI2012-37806-C02-01, UPV/EHU GIU 10/20 y UFI11/28.Iriondo, N.; Estévez, E.; Priego, R.; Marcos, M.

18540517,2013-05-01T00:00:00,"The current challenge in automatic brain tumor classification based on MRS is the improvement of the robustness of the classification models that explicitly account for the probable breach of the independent and identically distributed conditions in the MRS data points. To contribute to this purpose, a new algorithm for the extraction of discriminant MRS features of brain tumors based on a functional approach is presented. Functional data analysis based on region segmentation (RSFDA) is based on the functional data analysis formalism using nonuniformly distributed B splines according to spectral regions that are highly correlated. An exhaustive characterization of the method is presented in this work using controlled and real scenarios. The performance of RSFDA was compared with other widely used feature extraction methods. In all simulated conditions, RSFDA was proven to be stable with respect to the number of variables selected and with respect to the classification performance against noise and baseline artifacts. Furthermore, with real multicenter datasets classification, RSFDA and peak integration (PI) obtained better performance than the other feature extraction methods used for comparison. Other advantages of the method proposed are its usefulness in selecting the optimal number of features for classification and its simplified functional representation of the spectra, which contributes to highlight the discriminative regions of the MR spectrum for each classification task. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The authors gratefully acknowledge former INTERPRET and eTUMOUR European project partners.

The use of standards in the implementation of an intelligent distributed system is always advantageous. This paper presents a middleware that provides support to a multi-agent system. Middleware is based on the standard Data Distribution Services (DDS), proposed by Object Management Group (OGM). Middleware organizes information by tree based ontology and provides a set of quality of service policies that agents can use to increase efficiency. DDS provides a set of quality of service policy. Joining quality of service policy and the ontology allows getting many advantages, among others the possibility of to conceal some details of the communications system to agents, the correct location of the agents in the distributed system, or the monitoring agents in terms of quality of service. For modeling the middleware architecture it has used UML class diagrams. As an example it has presented the implementation of a mobile robot navigation system through agents that model behaviors.The MAS architecture described in this article is a part of the coordinated project SIDIRELI: Distributed Systems with Limited Resources.

58795057,2011-11-01T00:00:00,"Autonomy is a prime issue on robotics field and it is closely related to decision making. Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments. In this paper, a first implementation of the decision making system and the learning process is implemented on a social robot showing an improvement in robot's performance. The quality of its performance will be determined by observing the evolution of the robot's wellbeing.The funds provided by the Spanish Government through the project called “Peer

61623368,[[issued]]2009-10-14T09:37:41Z,"[[abstract]]© 1999 Elsevier - When a speech recognition system is deployed in the real world, environmental interference will make noisy speech signals and reference models mismatched and cause serious degradation in recognition accuracy. To deal with the effect of environmental mismatch, a family of signal limiters has been successfully applied to a template-based DTW recognizer to reduce the variability of speech features in noisy conditions. Though simulation results indicate that heavily smoothing can effectively reduce the variability of speech features in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it would also cause the loss of information in speech features. Therefore, we suggest that the smoothing factor of a signal limiter should be related to SNR and adapted on a frame by frame basis. In this paper, an adaptive signal limiter (ASL) is proposed to smooth the instantaneous and dynamic spectral features of reference models and test speech. By smoothing spectral features, the smoothed covariance matrices of reference models can be obtained by means of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. A speech recognition task for multispeaker isolated Mandarin digits has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the adaptive signal limiter can achieve significant improvement in noisy conditions and is more robust than the hard limiter over a wider range of SNR values.[[department]]電機工程學",Elsevier,Smoothing hidden Markov models by using an adaptive signal limiter for noisy speech recognition,10.1016/S0167-6393(99)00011-4,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this perspective, the first problem to face is the need for a valid methodology for ancient landscape ecosystem reconstruction, before dealing with monuments and building. On the basis of an intense multi-disciplinary discussion and the previous VH Lab experience in this field, in this article we are presenting a scheme for a standardized reconstruction procedure, where the landscape is built using all available sources and elevation data obtained by a photogrammetry process on historical pictures. Ecosystem areas are then calculated through GIS elaboration in GRASS-GIS environment, through a procedure which may be shared for any situation of historical landscape reconstruction, allowing the matching and the mathematical processing of geographical data aimed to the definition of different ecological areas (both in terms of natural vegetation and cultivated lands). Maps are then created to be imported in procedural landscape generation engines: the last part of the paper focuses on the lack of effective open source software in this field, and a possible proposal implementation in this sense1.

In this field, we have been working on a wearable mobility aid aimed at detecting in real-time obstacles in front of a visually impaired. Our approach relies on a custom RGBD camera, with FPGA on-board processing, worn as traditional eyeglasses and effective point-cloud processing implemented on a compact and lightweight embedded computer. This latter device also provides feedback to the user by means of an haptic interface as well as audio messages. In this paper we address crosswalk recognition that, as pointed out by several visually impaired users involved in the evaluation of our system, is a crucial requirement in the design of an effective mobility aid. Specifically, we propose a reliable methodology to detect and categorize crosswalks by leveraging on point-cloud processing and deep-learning techniques.

225416598,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) sizing in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial for follow-up and outcome. Recently, the automated quantification of LA using the novel three-beat averaging real-time three dimensional echocardiography (3BA-RT3DE) is introduced. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of 3BA-RT3DE in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

METHODS: Thirty-one patients with AF (62.8 ± 11.7 years, 67.7 % male) were prospectively recruited to have two dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and 3BA-RT3DE (SC 2000, ACUSON, USA). The maximal left atrial (LA) volume was measured by the conventional prolate-ellipse (PE) and area-length (AL) method using three-beat averaging 2D transthoracic echocardiography and automated software analysis (eSie volume analysis, Siemens Medical Solution, Mountain view, USA); measurements were compared with those obtained by computed tomography (CT).

RESULTS: Maximal LA volume by 3BA-RT3DE was feasible for all patients. LA volume was 68.4 ± 28.2 by PE-2DE, 89.2 ± 33.1 by AL-2DE, 100.6 ± 31.8 by 3BA-RT3DE, and 131.2 ± 42.2 mL by CT. LA volume from PE-2DE (R(2) = 0.48, p < 0.001, ICC = 0.64, p < 0.001), AL-2DE (R(2) = 0.47, p < 0.001, ICC = 0.67, p < 0.001), and 3BA-RT3DE (R(2) = 0.50, p = 0.001, ICC = 0.65, p < 0.001) showed significant correlations with CT. However, 3BA-RT3DE demonstrated a small degree of underestimation (30.5 mL) of LA volume compared to 2DE-based measurements. Good-quality images from 3BA-RT3DE (n = 16) showed a significantly tighter correlation with images from CT scanning (R(2) = 0.60, p = 0.0004, ICC = 0.76, p < 0.001) compared to those of fair quality.

CONCLUSION: Automated quantification of LA volume using 3BA-RT3DE is feasible and accurate in patients with AF.

162408305,2007-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper focuses on the results of different consumer surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006 with regard to consumers ' perceptions and reactions concerning AI in Vietnam, (mainly in Hanoi). The main results observed are as follows: - A high proportion of consumers consider AI to be a food-related risk. However, over time, there has been a slight shift from a fear of consuming poultry to a fear of preparing it (slaughtering it). - AI has had a profound effect on poultry consumption, even outside peak crisis times, more in terms of the quantity consumed (approximately a third less in 2006) than in terms of the number of consumers (6% less). - Blood and internal organs are considered particularly risky, while eggs are viewed as being safer. Poultry from industrial farms is considered to be more risky than poultry from small farms. - Purchasing practices have also been affected by AI: in Hanoi, consumers declare that they prefer to buy poultry directly from producers that they know, or from supermarkets in the case of the wealthiest consumers. A high proportion still buy live poultry from market traders, but more consumers now ask sellers to slaughter it for them. With a view to lessening market shocks in the wake of the crisis while maintaining the priority of consumer safety, a number of measures should nevertheless be implemented: Risk communication should not over-emphasize AI as a food-related risk. - Reliable safe distribution channels should be promoted (with reliable quality signs and controls) in order to encourage safe production and poultry consumption. Otherwise, a market recovery will only benefit supermarkets and large-scale farmers capable of supplying supermarkets. - As numerous live birds are still slaughtered in urban market places, facilities should be provided for safe slaughter. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the provision of a real ""cold chain"" with a view to promoting the sale of slaughtered poultry.

275626576,2015-02-01T00:00:00,"The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-014-1307-6.Control architectures based on Emotions are becoming promising solutions for the implementation of future robotic agents. The basic controllers of the architecture are the emotional processes that decide which behaviors of the robot must activate to fulfill the objectives. The number of emotional processes increases (hundreds of millions/s) with the complexity level of the application, reducing the processing capacity of the main processor to solve complex problems (millions of decisions in a given instant). However, the potential parallelism of the emotional processes permits their execution in parallel on FPGAs or Multicores, thus enabling slack computing in the main processor to tackle more complex dynamic problems. In this paper, an emotional architecture for mobile robotic agents is presented. The workload of the emotional processes is evaluated. Then, the main processor is extended with FPGA co-processors through Ethernet link. The FPGAs will be in charge of the execution of the emotional processes in parallel. Different Stratix FPGAs are compared to analyze their suitability to cope with the proposed mobile robotic agent applications. The applications are set up taking into account different environmental conditions, robot dynamics and emotional states. Moreover, the applications are run also on Multicore processors to compare their performance in relation to the FPGAs. Experimental results show that Stratix IV FPGA increases the performance in about one order of magnitude over the main processor and solves all the considered problems. Quad-Core increases the performance in 3.64 times, allowing to tackle about 89 % of the considered problems. Quad-Core has a lower cost than a Stratix IV, so more adequate solution but not for the most complex application. Stratix III could be applied to solve problems with around the double of the requirements that the main processor could support. Finally, a Dual-Core provides slightly better performance than stratix III and it is relatively cheaper.This work was supported in part under Spanish Grant PAID/2012/325 of ""Programa de Apoyo a la Investigacion y Desarrollo.

Accelerometers have been used in movement recognition systems, but rarely to assess expressive qualities of movement. We present a prototype of wearable system for the real-time detection and classification of movement quality using acceleration data. The system applies Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) to recognize Laban Effort qualities from acceleration input using a Machine Learning software that generates classifications in real time. Existing LMA-recognition systems rely on motion capture data and video data, and can only be deployed in controlled settings. Our single- accelerometer system is portable and can be used under a wide range of environmental conditions. We evaluate the performance of the system, present two applications using the system in the digital arts and discuss future directions",'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',Designing For Movement: Evaluating Computational Models using LMA Effort Qualities,10.1145/2556288.2557251,,,core,multimedia,'multimedia' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
226063288,2015,"In lab-on-chip for food analysis, dealing with large samples with complex composition (i.e. the matrix) and target analytes potentially in very low concentrations is one of major issues that needs to be tackled. In order to increase the analytical accuracy of a method, it is often required to process the sample before quantification of the chemical specie under examination. In milk case, the presence of fat, proteins and many other components in a complex phase equilibrium poses particular challenges for analysis. Caseins, in particular, are known as blocking agent for surfaces, and therefore may interact with sensor surfaces. Many methods are available for microfluidic processing [1], but they are usually developed for small samples (often blood). Scaling up processing rate to deal with 1-100ml samples in minutes is not practical in most cases. In milk, casein is usually found in micelles the size of about 50-300nm [2], formed by hydrophobic caseins complexed by calcium ions and enclosed by partially hydrophilic k-casein. Since isoelectric point of casein is 4.6, at milk pH there is an intrinsic negative charge, which can be used to separate it from the sample. Other options include size and density separation in microfluidic structure as for instance acoustic separation.

In this paper, we present the development of a high-throughput electrophoretic separation system for milk proteins allowing the separation of casein at flow rates in the range of mls/min, by exploiting the intrinsic charge of casein at milk pH (i.e. 6.6). The device is intended as a step for sample preparation to increase the accuracy of detection of contaminants in milk samples. Design, estimated performances and implementation of the device for the experimental evaluation of the approach are reported. We preliminary focused on BSA, lactoglobulins and caseins as model molecules. An electrophoretic mobility of -1.39µm cm V-1 s-1 was measured for casein in conditions as close as possible to real sample (typical ionic strength of milk 0.08M, pH 6.6). The range of flow rate suitable for separation can be estimated by the velocity of electrophoretic drag and flow velocity. Modelling of device provided the evaluation of optimal working conditions and design (potential and flow rate); with a maximum applied potential of 1.4V, the expected fractionation of proteins between the two outlets is reported in Fig. 1, where 0.5 is equivalent to no separation.

The device was implemented with platinum electrodes lithographed on silica glass wafers with semi-transparent grid pattern for inspection. In order to increase the throughput, we designed a separation chamber with large cross section (Fig. 2), where electrodes are facing on top and bottom walls of a chamber with width 4mm and channel height 510µm. Electrodes are 28 mm long. Electric field applied drags charged particle toward the upper or lower walls depending on charge. The fluidic chamber was fabricated by 3D printing in PVC and assembled using two shells machined to house the electrode chips (Fig. 3).

78071095,2015-06-01T00:00:00,"We present a wearable system that uses ambient electromagnetic interference (EMI) as a signature to identify electronic devices and support proxemic interaction. We designed a low cost tool, called EMI Spy, and a software environment for rapid deployment and evaluation of ambient EMI-based interactive infrastructure. EMI Spy captures electromagnetic interference and delivers the signal to a user's mobile device or PC through either the device's wired audio input or wirelessly using Bluetooth. The wireless version can be worn on the wrist, communicating with the user;s mobile device in their pocket. Users are able to train the system in less than 1 second to uniquely identify displays in a 2-m radius around them, as well as to detect pointing at a distance and touching gestures on the displays in real-time. The combination of a low cost EMI logger and an open source machine learning tool kit allows developers to quickly prototype proxemic, touch-to-connect, and gestural interaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of mobile, EMI-based device and gesture recognition with preliminary user studies in 3 scenarios, achieving 96% classification accuracy at close range for 6 digital signage displays distributed throughout a building, and 90% accuracy in classifying pointing gestures at neighboring desktop LCD displays. We were able to distinguish 1- and 2-finger touching with perfect accuracy and show indications of a way to determine power consumption of a device via touch. Our system is particularly well-suited to temporary use in a public space, where the sensors could be distributed to support a popup interactive environment anywhere with electronic devices.

275591294,2012-01-01T00:00:00,"Polynomial constraint solving plays a prominent role in several areas of hardware and software analysis and verification, e.g.; termination proving, program invariant generation and hybrid system verification, to name a few. In this paper we propose a new method for solving non-linear constraints based on encoding the problem into an SMT problem considering only linear arithmetic. Unlike other existing methods, our method focuses on proving satisfiability of the constraints rather than on proving unsatisfiability, which is more relevant in several applications as we illustrate with several examples. Nevertheless, we also present new techniques based on the analysis of unsatisfiable cores that allow one to efficiently prove unsatisfiability too for a broad class of problems. The power of our approach is demonstrated by means of extensive experiments comparing our prototype with state-of-the-art tools on benchmarks taken both from the academic and the industrial world. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.This work has been partially supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MEC/MICINN, under grants TIN 2007-68093-C02-01 and TIN 2007-68093-C02-02.Borralleras, C.; Lucas Alba, S.; Oliveras ., A.; Rodriguez-Carbonell, E.; Rubio ., A.

203467222,2015-02-28,"AbstractPassive site stabilization is a developing technology for the in situ mitigation of the risk of liquefaction without surface disruption. It involves the injection of stabilizing materials into liquefiable saturated sand. In this study, a pilot-scale facility (243cm by 366cm in plan×122cm deep) was used to inject a dilute colloidal silica stabilizer into liquefiable sand specimens. The grout advancement was monitored in real time using electrical conductivity cells embedded in the specimens. Injection rates ranging from 65 to 9000ml/min/well were used to investigate the optimal rate of grout delivery. In tests with low injection rates, the delivery performance was low due to sinking, while at higher injection rates, sinking was less noticeable. After the treatment, the degree of grout penetration was evaluated by excavating the model. The in situ unconfined compressive strength was measured using a pocket penetrometer, and soil blocks were excavated for additional unconfined compressive testing. Moreover, the 3-D flood simulator, UTCHEM, was utilized to simulate the experimental results and to predict the injection rates for adequate stabilizer delivery. The results of the strength testing demonstrated that as little as 1% by weight of the colloidal silica provides a significant improvement in strength after a month of curing. The study also revealed the feasibility of delivering colloidal silica to liquefiable sands by implementing a large-scale treatment",Japanese Geotechnical Society.

37973387,2012-01-01T00:00:00,"Energy efficiency at the software level has gained much attention in the past decade. This paper presents a performance-aware frequency assignment algorithm for reducing processor energy consumption using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Existing energy-saving techniques often rely on simplified predictions or domain knowledge to extract energy savings for specialized software (such as multimedia or mobile applications) or hardware (such as NPU or sensor nodes). We present an innovative framework, known as EClass, for general-purpose DVFS processors by recognizing short and repetitive utilization patterns efficiently using machine learning. Our algorithm is lightweight and can save up to 52.9% of the energy consumption compared with the classical PAST algorithm. It achieves an average savings of 9.1% when compared with an existing online learning algorithm that also utilizes the statistics from the current execution only. We have simulated the algorithms on a cycle-accurate power simulator. Experimental results show that EClass can effectively save energy for real life applications that exhibit mixed CPU utilization patterns during executions. Our research challenges an assumption among previous work in the research community that a simple and efficient heuristic should be used to adjust the processor frequency online. Our empirical result shows that the use of an advanced algorithm such as machine learning can not only compensate for the energy needed to run such an algorithm, but also outperforms prior techniques based on the above assumption. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

226465289,2015-04-21T07:42:35,"none582BACKGROUND: Multi-element interventions for first-episode psychosis (FEP) are promising, but have mostly been conducted in non-epidemiologically representative samples, thereby raising the risk of underestimating the complexities involved in treating FEP in 'real-world' services. METHODS/DESIGN: The Psychosis early Intervention and Assessment of Needs and Outcome (PIANO) trial is part of a larger research program (Genetics, Endophenotypes and Treatment: Understanding early Psychosis - GET UP) which aims to compare, at 9 months, the effectiveness of a multi-component psychosocial intervention versus treatment as usual (TAU) in a large epidemiologically based cohort of patients with FEP and their family members recruited from all public community mental health centers (CMHCs) located in two entire regions of Italy (Veneto and Emilia Romagna), and in the cities of Florence, Milan and Bolzano. The GET UP PIANO trial has a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled design. The randomized units (clusters) are the CMHCs, and the units of observation are the centers' patients and their family members. Patients in the experimental group will receive TAU plus: 1) cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, 2) psycho-educational sessions for family members, and 3) case management. Patient enrollment will take place over a 1-year period. Several psychopathological, psychological, functioning, and service use variables will be assessed at baseline and follow-up. The primary outcomes are: 1) change from baseline to follow-up in positive and negative symptoms' severity and subjective appraisal; 2) relapse occurrences between baseline and follow-up, that is, episodes resulting in admission and/or any case-note records of re-emergence of positive psychotic symptoms. The expected number of recruited patients is about 400, and that of relatives about 300. Owing to the implementation of the intervention at the CMHC level, the blinding of patients, clinicians, and raters is not possible, but every effort will be made to preserve the independency of the raters. We expect that this study will generate evidence on the best treatments for FEP, and will identify barriers that may hinder its feasibility in 'real-world' clinical settings, patient/family conditions that may render this intervention ineffective or inappropriate, and clinical, psychological, environmental, and service organization predictors of treatment effectiveness, compliance, and service satisfaction.Ruggeri M, Bonetto C, Lasalvia A, De Girolamo G, Fioritti A, Rucci P, Santonastaso P, Neri G, Pileggi F, Ghigi D, Miceli M, Scarone S, Cocchi A, Torresani S, Faravelli C, Zimmermann C, Meneghelli A, Cremonese C, Scocco P, Leuci E, Mazzi F, Gennarelli M, Brambilla P, Bissoli S, Bertani ME, Tosato S, De Santi K, Poli S, Cristofalo D, Tansella M; GET UP GROUP, Ruggeri M, Mirella ME, Bissoli S, Bonetto C, Cristofalo D, De Santi K, Lasalvia A, Lunardi S, Negretto V, Poli S, Tosato S, Zamboni MG, Ballarin M, De Girolamo G, Fioritti A, Neri G, Pileggi F, Rucci P, Bocchio Chiavetto L, Scasselatti C, Zanardini R, Brambilla P, Bellani M, Bertoldo A, Marinelli V, Negretto V, Perlini C, Rambaldelli G, Lasalvia A, Bertani M, Bissoli S, Lazzarotto L, Bardella S, Gardellin F, Lamonaca D, Lasalvia A, Lunardon M, Magnabosco R, Martucci M, Nicolau S, Nifosì F, Pavanati M, Rossi M, Piazza C, Piccione G, Sala A, Sale A, Stefan B, Zotos S, Balbo M, Boggian I, Ceccato E, Dall'Agnola R, Gardellin F, Girotto B, Goss C, Lamonaca D, Lasalvia A, Leoni R, Mai A, Pasqualini A, Pavanati M, Piazza C,

is very important because their deterioration may cause the value lost and even
the product rejection by the buyer. For this reason, in this paper we present a
cooperative monitoring system for the delivery of fresh products. The system
consists of fixed wireless nodes and a mobile wireless node that is installed in
the packet. This mobile node is able to take data of the internal temperature,
external temperature and the 3 axis movement. With the information stored in
the network, a vendor can know the optimal conditions of the transport. Finally,
we test the maximum distance to the fixed nodes, as well as the data collected by
the sensor.Sendra, S.; Lloret, J.; Lacuesta, R.; Jimenez, JM. (2015). Cooperative Monitoring of the Delivery of Fresh Products.
