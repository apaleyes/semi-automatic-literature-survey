237183624,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Parking vehicle is a daunting task and a common problem in many cities around the globe. The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection. The detected results were compared with a template of parking spaces and IoU value is used to identify vehicle occupancy information",'Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)',Deep learning-based vehicle occupancy detection in an open parking lot using thermal camera,10.1049/iet-its.2019.0468,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
427469430,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper investigates the use of recurrent neural network to predict urban long-term traffic flows. A representation of the long-term flows with related weather and contextual information is first introduced. A recurrent neural network approach, named RNN-LF, is then proposed to predict the long-term of flows from multiple data sources. Moreover, a parallel implementation on GPU of the proposed solution is developed (GRNN-LF), which allows to boost the performance of RNN-LF. Several experiments have been carried out on real traffic flow including a small city (Odense, Denmark) and a very big city (Beijing). The results reveal that the sequential version (RNN-LF) is capable of dealing effectively with traffic of small cities. They also confirm the scalability of GRNN-LF compared to the most competitive GPU-based software tools when dealing with big traffic flow such as Beijing urban data.publishedVersio",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A recurrent neural network for urban long-term traffic flow forecasting,10.1007/s10489-020-01716-1,https://core.ac.uk/download/427469430.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429122164,2020-08-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The paper presents the results of the Battle of Postdisaster Response and Restoration (BPDRR) presented in a special session at the first International water distribution systems analysis & computing and control in the water industry (WDSA/CCWI) Joint Conference, held in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in July 2018. The BPDRR problem focused on how to respond and restore water service after the occurrence of five earthquake scenarios that cause structural damage in a water distribution system. Participants were required to propose a prioritization schedule to fix the damages of each scenario while following restrictions on visibility/nonvisibility of damages. Each team/approach was evaluated against six performance criteria: (1) time without supply for hospital/firefighting, (2) rapidity of recovery, (3) resilience loss, (4) average time of no user service, (5) number of users without service for eight consecutive hours, and (6) water loss. Three main types of approaches were identified from the submissions: (1) general-purpose metaheuristic algorithms, (2) greedy algorithms, and (3) ranking-based prioritizations. All three approaches showed potential to solve the challenge efficiently. The results of the participants showed that for this network, the impact of a large-diameter pipe failure on the network is more significant than several smaller pipes failures. The location of isolation valves and the size of hydraulic segments influenced the resilience of the system during emergencies. On average, the interruptions to water supply (hospitals and firefighting) varied considerably among solutions and emergency scenarios, highlighting the importance of private water storage for emergencies. The effects of damages and repair work were more noticeable during the peak demand periods (morning and noontime) than during the low-flow periods; and tank storage helped to preserve functionality of the network in the first few hours after a simulated event.

441570737,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"In the existing network-layered architectural stack of Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Network (CRAHN), channel selection is performed at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. However, routing is done on the network layer. Due to this limitation, the Secondary/Unlicensed Users (SUs) need to access the channel information from the MAC layer whenever the channel switching event occurred during the data transmission. This issue delayed the channel selection process during the immediate routing decision for the channel switching event to continue the transmission. In this paper, a protocol is proposed to implement the channel selection decisions at the network layer during the routing process. The decision is based on past and expected future routing decisions of Primary Users (PUs). A learning agent operating in the cross-layer mode of the network-layered architectural stack is implemented in the spectrum mobility manager to pass the channel information to the network layer. This information is originated at the MAC layer. The channel selection is performed on the basis of reinforcement learning algorithms such as No-External Regret Learning, Q-Learning, and Learning Automata. This leads to minimizing the channel switching events and user interferences in the Reinforcement Learning- (RL-) based routing protocol. Simulations are conducted using Cognitive Radio Cognitive Network simulator based on Network Simulator (NS-2). The simulation results showed that the proposed routing protocol performed better than all the other comparative routing protocols in terms of number of channel switching events, average data rate, packet collision, packet loss, and end-to-end delay. The proposed routing protocol implies the improved Quality of Service (QoS) of the delay sensitive and real-time networks such as Cellular and Tele Vision (TV) networks",'Hindawi Limited',Reinforcement Learning-Based Routing Protocol to Minimize Channel Switching and Interference for Cognitive Radio Networks,10.1155/2020/8257168,,"[{'title': 'Complexity', 'identifiers': ['issn:1099-0526', 'issn:1076-2787', '1076-2787', '1099-0526']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490881774,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"Skateboarding as a method of transportation has become prevalent, which has increased the occurrence and likelihood of pedestrian–skateboarder collisions and near-collision scenarios in shared-use roadway areas. Collisions between pedestrians and skateboarders can result in significant injury. New approaches are needed to evaluate shared-use areas prone to hazardous pedestrian–skateboarder interactions, and perform real-time, in situ (e.g., on-device) predictions of pedestrian–skateboarder collisions as road conditions vary due to changes in land usage and construction. A mechanism called the Surrogate Safety Measures for skateboarder–pedestrian interaction can be computed to evaluate high-risk conditions on roads and sidewalks using deep learning object detection models. In this paper, we present the first ever skateboarder–pedestrian safety study leveraging deep learning architectures. We view and analyze state of the art deep learning architectures, namely the Faster R-CNN and two variants of the Single Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD) model to select the correct model that best suits two different tasks: automated calculation of Post Encroachment Time (PET) and finding hazardous conflict zones in real-time. We also contribute a new annotated data set that contains skateboarder–pedestrian interactions that has been collected for this study. Both our selected models can detect and classify pedestrians and skateboarders correctly and efficiently. However, due to differences in their architectures and based on the advantages and disadvantages of each model, both models were individually used to perform two different set of tasks. Due to improved accuracy, the Faster R-CNN model was used to automate the calculation of post encroachment time, whereas to determine hazardous regions in real-time, due to its extremely fast inference rate, the Single Shot Multibox MobileNet V1 model was used. An outcome of this work is a model that can be deployed on low-cost, small-footprint mobile and IoT devices at traffic intersections with existing cameras to perform on-device inferencing for in situ Surrogate Safety Measurement (SSM), such as Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Post Encroachment Time (PET).

This paper proposes an airbag system with a more efficient algorithm to decide the deployment of a wearable bike airbag in case of an accident. The existing wearable airbags are operated by judging the accident situations using the thresholds of sensors. However, in this case, the judgment accuracy can drop against various motions. This study used the long short-term memory (LSTM) model using the sensor values of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) as input values to judge accident occurrences, which obtains data in real time from the three acceleration-axis and three angular velocity-axis sensors on the driver motion states and judges whether or not an accident has occurred using the obtained data. The existing neural network (NN) or convolutional neural network (CNN) model judges only the input data.

The reason is its limitations in adapting the dynamically changing information of users, tasks, access policies and resources in such applications. It also does not incorporate semantically meaningful business roles, which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in such multi-domain collaborative business environments. We propose an Intelligent Role-based Access Control (I-RBAC) model that uses intelligent software agents for achieving intelligent access control in such highly dynamic multi-domain environments. The novelty of this model lies in using a core I-RBAC ontology that is developed using real-world semantic business roles as occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. It contains around 1400 business roles, from nearly all domains, along with their detailed task descriptions as well as hierarchical relationships among them. The semantic role mining process is performed through intelligent agents that use word embedding and a bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from its unstructured text policy and, subsequently, matching this ontology with core I-RBAC ontology to extract unified business roles.

480287036,2021-05-12T00:00:00,"Modern Smart Cities are highly dependent on an efficient energy service since electricity is used in an increasing number of urban activities. In this regard, Time-of-Use prices for electricity is a widely implemented policy that has been successful to balance electricity consumption along the day and, thus, diminish the stress and risk of shortcuts of electric grids in peak hours. Indeed, residential customers may now schedule the use of deferrable electrical appliances in their smart homes in off-peak hours to reduce the electricity bill. In this context, this work aims to develop an automatic planning tool that accounts for minimizing the electricity costs and enhancing user satisfaction, allowing them to make more efficient usage of the energy consumed. The household energy consumption planning problem is addressed with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, for which problem-specific operators are devised, and a set of state-of-the-art greedy algorithms aim to optimize different criteria. The proposed resolution algorithms are tested over a set of realistic instances built using real-world energy consumption data, Time-of-Use prices from an electricity company, and user preferences estimated from historical information and sensor data. The results show that the evolutionary algorithm is able to improve upon the greedy algorithms both in terms of the electricity costs and user satisfaction and largely outperforms to a large extent the current strategy without planning implemented by users.Fil: Nesmachnow, Sergio.

Machine learning (ML) is the kernel for building a satisfactory EFWS. This paper first summarizes the ML methods proposed in this special issue for flood forecasts and their significant advantages. Then, it develops an intelligent hydroinformatics integration platform (IHIP) to derive a user-friendly web interface system through the state-of-the-art machine learning, visualization and system developing techniques for improving online forecast capability and flood risk management. The holistic framework of the IHIP includes five layers (data access, data integration, servicer, functional subsystem, and end-user application) and one database for effectively dealing with flood disasters. The IHIP provides real-time flood-related data, such as rainfall and multi-step-ahead regional flood inundation maps. The interface of Google Maps fused into the IHIP significantly removes the obstacles for users to access this system, helps communities in making better-informed decisions about the occurrence of floods, and alerts communities in advance. The IHIP has been implemented in the Tainan City of Taiwan as the study case.

This work was the first step of a wider project aimed at providing a Spell Checking Web Service API for Smart City communication platforms able to automatically select, among the large availability of open source spell checking tools, the most suitable tool based on the semantic structure of the specific textual data. The system should manage an enhanced Italian Vocabulary Database, specifically implemented to support all the tools of the system. The goal of the present work was to test, through an experimental research, the feasibility of the entire project by implementing a Spell Checking Prototype System designed to manage two selected spell checking tools. Results showed that the Spell Checking Prototype System significantly improves performances by allowing the user to select the most suitable tool for the specific semantic structure of the text. The system also enables to manage the list of exceptions, which continuously enhance the Italian Vocabulary Database. The experimentation proved scientific evidence of the validity of the project aimed at implementing a Spell Checking Web Service API in order to improve the quality of natural language data to be stored or processed in Smart City NCeSDP systems, through the use of existing spell checking tools","'Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.'",A Spell Checking Web Service API for Smart City Communication Platforms,10.4236/ojapps.2019.912066,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The management of this large inventory of bicycles is a particularly challenging issue with the goal to ensure the demand for bicycles is met at all times across the network. To this end, an efficient scheduling approach is needed with the capacity to guide the redistribution of bicycles across the self-service stations. Drawing on 7 years of disaggregate trip data, this study first captures the usage dynamics across both space and time to extract the candidate stations and redistribution periods for vehicle scheduling. A region partition method with K-means clustering is proposed to satisfy the real-time requirement of large-scale PBSPs&#039; redistribution. Moreover, drawing on the variations in demand a back-propagation neural network short-term prediction model is computed to inform the necessary prospective redistribution of bicycles to ensure demand is always met.

In 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, many predicted that sealed gates would soon become relics of a bygone era. Today, we find a different reality. Instead of disappearing, borders are transforming. In this article, we build upon the shifting border logic to explore how responses to the global pandemic have accelerated processes of detachment of mobility control from a fixed territorial marker. From global travel bans to mandating prearrival proof of a negative test result taken within 48 or 72 hours prior to departure to requiring digital registration of a passenger's travel history to enforcing strict post-arrival mandatory quarantine orders that arrest mobility, the shifting border paradigm has provided a template for policymakers to respond to a mounting global crisis. In addition to regulating movement across international borders and within countries, we trace the surprising return of subnational and interregional division lines in managing mobility, the erosion of the once taken for granted right to return to one’s home country, and the spatial and legal techniques used to block refugees from reaching terra firma during the pandemic. Next, we critically evaluate the authorization given under emergency regulations to deploy novel biometric and AI technologies, big data, and predictive algorithms to surveil moving bodies at real time and reprimand those deemed to have breached their quarantine or related governmental emergency measures.

This paper focuses on the bike-sharing rebalancing problem (BRP), which consists of two aspects: determining desired demands at each station and designing routes to redistribute bikes among stations. For the first task, we firstly apply the random forest, a very efficient machine learning algorithm, to forecast desired demands for each station, which can be easily implemented with distributed computing. For the second task, it belongs to the broad class of the vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery (VRPPD). In most existing settings, all of the demands being strictly satisfied can lead to longer routes and add operational costs. In this paper, we propose a new model with unserved demands by relaxing demands satisfying constraints. Then, we design a distributed ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm with some specific modifications to increase its efficiency for the proposed model. We propose to use the percentage of average cost saving per bike as a metric to evaluate the performance of our method on cost-reducing and compare with existing methods and best-known values.

The considered vehicle is an all-wheel drive full-electric single-seater prototype. The retained PIL architecture includes all the modules required for autonomous driving at system level: environment perception, trajectory planning, and control. Specifically, the perception pipeline exploits obstacle detection algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the trajectory planning is based on a modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm based on Dubins curves, while the vehicle is controlled via a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. The considered PIL layout is implemented firstly using a low-cost card-sized computer for fast code verification purposes. Furthermore, the proposed PIL architecture is compared in terms of performance to an alternative PIL using high-performance real-time target computing machine.

It provides recommendations by exploiting the IoT technology (parking and traffic sensors). The IoTRec provides four-fold functions. First, it helps the user to find a free parking spot based on different metrics (such as the nearest or nearest trusted parking spot). Second, it recommends a route (the least crowded or the shortest route) leading to the recommended parking spot from the user´s current location. Third, it provides the real-time provision of expected availability of parking areas (comprised of parking spots organized into groups) in a user-friendly manner. Finally, it provides a GDPR-compliant implementation for operating in a privacy-aware environment. The IoTRec is integrated into the smart parking use case of the WISE-IoT project and is evaluated by the citizens of Santander, Spain through a prototype, but it can be applied to any IoT-enabled locality.

To deal with this challenging setting, when satellite image time series data are available, we propose a new framework named positive and unlabelled learning of satellite image time series (PUL-SITS).

La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).

Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).

approach allows us not only to detect the object (pedestrian) but also to estimates the distance between the target and the drone. 2. Object/Pedestrian detection-based Deep Learning approach. The target position estimation has been carried out within image

By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks. We demonstrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of Citrus: a novel intrusion detection framework which is adept at tackling emerging threats through the collection and labelling of live attack data by utilising diverse Internet vantage points in order to detect and classify malicious behaviour using graph-based metrics as well as a range of machine learning (ML) algorithms.

268906452,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Efficiency and safety are primary requirements for oil &amp; gas fluid filled transportation system. However, the complexity of the asset makes it challenging to derive a theoretical framework for managing the control parameters. The current frontier for a real time monitoring exploits the ""digital tansformation"", i.e. the acquisition and the analysis of large datasets recorded along the whole asset lifecycle, which are used to infer ""data driven"" relations and to predict the evolution of the asset integrity. This paper presents some results of a research project for the design, implementation and testing of a ""machine learning"" approach to vibroacoustic data recorded continuously by acquisition units installed every 10-20 km along a pipeline. In a fluid transportation system, vibroacoustic signals are generated by the flow regulation equipment (i.e. pumping, valves, metering), by the fluid flowing (i.e. turbulence, cavitation, bubbles), by third party interference (i.e. spillage, sabotage, illegal tapping), by internal inspection using PIGs operations), and by natural hazards (i.e. microseismic, subsidence, landslides). The basic principle of machine learning is to ""observe"", for an appropriate time interval, a series of descriptors, in this stage related to vibroacoustic signals but that can be integrated with other physical data (i.e. temperature, density, viscosity), in order to ""learn"" their safe range of variation or, when properly fed to a classification procedure, to obtain automatically a discrete set of operational status. The classification criteria are then applied to new data, highlighting the presence of system anomalies. The paper considers vibroacoustic signals collected at the flow stations of an oil trunkline in Nigeria. The vibroacoustic signals are the static pressure, the acceleration and the pressure transients recorded at the departure and at the arrival terminals. More than one year of data is available. Derived smart indicators are defined, which are directly linked to the asset parameters: for instance, the cross-correlation of the pressure transients at adjacent measuring locations permits to estimate the fluid channel continuity (correlation value), the sound velocity (time of correlation peak), and the sound attenuation (amplitude versus frequency amplitude decay). A portion of the data during normal operation is used for training and tuning a reference model. After that, new data are compared with the model, and anomalies are automatically detected. Two kind of errors are raised: i) sensors; ii) alerts. Sensor errors are referred to missing or corrupted sensors data. Alerts are raised when the measured physical quantities are not coherent with the functional and known service behaviors of the transport system. The system model is not static over time, and in fact it can be updated by the operators’ feedback, that can tag false alarms and thus, automatically, re-define the set of operational scenarios of the upstream system. The medium-long term construction and update of data driven models is effective for predictive maintenance, automatic anomalies detection, optimization of operational procedures. Moreover, the new policy of data management and the opportunity of gaining awareness by interconnecting the monitoring experience of different assets leverages the introduction of new technologies (cloud, big data), new professional figures (smart data scientist), new operational and business models",'Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)',Data Driven Smart Monitoring for Pipeline Integrity Assessment,10.2118/197327-MS,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The complex and opportunistic environment in which edge computing systems operate, poses a fundamental challenge for online edge system orchestration, resource provisioning and real-time responsiveness in response to user movement. Such a challenge needs to addressed throughout the edge system lifecycle, starting from the software development methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel development process for modeling opportunistic edge computing services, which rely on (i) ETSI MEC reference architecture and Opportunistic Internet of Things Service modeling for the early stage of system analysis and design, i.e. domain model and service metamodel; and on (ii) feature engineering for evaluating those opportunistic aspects with data analysis. To address the identified opportunistic properties, at the service design phase we construct (both automatically and through domain expertise) Opportunistic Feature Vectors for Edge, containing the numerical representations of those properties. Such vectors enable further data analysis and machine learning techniques in the development of distributed, effective and efficient edge computing systems. Lastly, we exemplify the integrated process with a microservice-based user mobility management service, based on a real-world data set, for online analysis in MEC systems",'Elsevier BV',Service modeling for opportunistic edge computing systems with feature engineering,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) are two of the technologies that are expected to play a pivotal role in 5G to achieve ambitious Quality of Service requirements of such applications. While NFV provides flexibility by enabling network functions to be dynamically deployed and inter-connected to realize Service Function Chains (SFC), MEC brings the computing capability to the edges of the mobile network thus reducing latency and alleviating the transport network load. However, adequate mechanisms are needed to meet the dynamically changing network service demands, to optimally utilize the network resources while, at the same time, making sure that the end-to-end latency requirement of services is always satisfied.

In this work, we first propose machine learning models, in particular neural-networks, that can perform auto-scaling by predicting the required number of virtual network function instances based on the traffic demand, using the traffic traces collected over a real-operator commercial network. We then employ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) techniques to formulate and solve a joint user association and SFC placement problem, where each SFC represents a service requested by a user with end-to-end latency and data rate requirements.

Many real-time solutions are giving benefits to both patients and professionals for remote data accessibility and suitable actions. However, timely medical decisions and efficient management of big data using IoT-based resources are the burning research challenges. Additionally, the distributed nature of data processing in many proposed solutions explicitly increases the threats of information leakages and damages the network integrity. Such solutions impose overhead on medical sensors and decrease the stability of the real-time transmission systems. Therefore, this paper presents a machine-learning model with SDN-enabled security to predict the consumption of network resources and improve the delivery of sensors data. Additionally, it offers centralized-based software define network (SDN) architecture to overcome the network threats among deployed sensors with nominal management cost. Firstly, it offers an unsupervised machine learning technique and decreases the communication overheads for IoT networks. Secondly, it predicts the link status using dynamic metrics and refines its strategies using SDN architecture. In the end, a security algorithm is utilized by the SDN controller that efficiently manages the consumption of the IoT nodes and protects it from unidentified occurrences.

One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city\u27s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried.

OpenFlow meter provides granular control and allows demand-based flow management to meet the diverse QoS requirements germane to IoT traffics. The proposed framework is then evaluated by emulating an EC scenario based on real NSF COSMOS testbed topology at The City College of New York.

The adaptive system contains software related to recommendation decision support systems. A distinctive feature of the system is the presence of elements of artificial intelligence, which self-learns by combinatorial processing of the historical database on operation of this or a similar technical object and current performance indicators corresponding to them.The proposed information processing algorithm is versatile and, in principle, can work with a variety of data sources, including existing traction rolling stock safety devices. Online monitoring of technical parameters of operated objects can be extended to both cargo-passenger rolling stock and related auxiliary machinery and devices (track machines, cranes, hump retarders, etc.).

322656801,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In any water utility, a reliable assessment of the service life of the network pipes is a key piece within the big puzzle of assets management. This paper presents a new statistical model (basic pipes life assessment, BPLA) to assess the service life of pipes, to locate the pipes on the failures bath curve and to forecast the expected failures in future years. Its main novelties are the processing of pipe information (is that information what is adapted to the classical maintenance engineering and not the other way back) and the definition of two different time variables that can be analyzed in parallel. The first novelty makes the model less demanding in terms of data and software tools than others currently available, and the second one allows to get all the results after one single stage of calculation. To show its usability, the BPLA has been applied to a pipe network that supplies water to 500,000 citizens for which two years of failure records are available.

322656794,2019-10-20T00:00:00,"[EN] Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

The influence of AI on the development of society, eco­nomic effect, methods and the field of application, the state of developments in the world and Ukraine are analyzed. In the next decade, AI will become the main mar­ket trend and the best business tool. The contribution of intellectual technologies to global GDP is estimated at 15.7 trillion. dollars In the next 5-10 years, China will be the leader in the successful operation and adaptation of AI technologies. Ac­cording to analysts, the most benefit from AI technologies will be in the areas of fi­nancial services, retail and medicine.The scientific and inventive activity in the sphere of AI, the role of protection of in­tellectual property (patent and copyright), and the maintenance of the balance of com­peting interests are researched. Recently, the number of inventions based on AI has sharply increased. The leaders in the number of such inventions are American compa­nies IBM and Microsoft. This growth is due to the fact that in recent years AI has evolved from the theoretical concept into a real product that gains the world market. Since the advent of AI in the 50’s of the last century, inventors and researchers have applied for almost 340 thousand inventions based on AI (as of the end of 2016) and published more than 1.6 million scientific articles. The transport sector, including au­tonomous vehicles, is one of the sectors with the highest rates of growth in the appli­cation of AI. China has become a global leader in increasing the number of patents in the AI sphere over the past five years.By the number of companies working in the sphere of AI, Ukraine is among the three leaders among the countries of Eastern Europe. There are 57 AI companies in Ukraine and it has 11 investorsGeneralized practice of state regulation of activity in the sphere of AI in indus­trialized countries and EU countries. More and more countries are developing na­tional AI strategies. Thus, 17 countries, including Canada, China, Denmark, France, India, South Korea and Taiwan, have already announced their AI strate­gies. Some of them invest billions of dollars in this area. China, for example, has invested more than $ 10 billion in this technological trend, followed by South Korea — $ 2 billion and France — $ 1.5 billion.

355099865,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Abstract: Poor management practices of road transport assets posed a challenge to the sustainable development of the transport system in developing countries like Nigeria. Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria. The study identified 4.0IR drivers to include; robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 3D printing drones that are built with an attached 3D printer, (the drone hangs a 3D printing nozzle that's fed plastic, concrete mix or other material from a tube connected to the top of the drone's printing path that precisely plotted by software, for a promised printing accuracy of 0.1mm),and digital engineering. This study emanated from the government reports and past studies in the area of road transport asset management practice which the study investigated the major causes of poor practices and assessed the effect of the fourth industrial revolution on the practice",,Effect of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on Road Transport Asset Management Practice in Nigeria,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429750270,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"In recent decades, automatic vehicle classification plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and visual traffic surveillance systems. Especially in countries that imposed a lockdown (mobility restrictions help reduce the spread of COVID-19), it becomes important to curtail the movement of vehicles as much as possible. For an effective visual traffic surveillance system, it is essential to detect vehicles from the images and classify the vehicles into different types (e.g., bus, car, and pickup truck). Most of the existing research studies focused only on maximizing the percentage of predictions, which have poor real-time performance and consume more computing resources. To highlight the problems of classifying imbalanced data, a new technique is proposed in this research article for vehicle type classification. Initially, the data are collected from the Beijing Institute of Technology Vehicle Dataset and the MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset. In addition, adaptive histogram equalization and the Gaussian mixture model are implemented for enhancing the quality of collected vehicle images and to detect vehicles from the denoised images. Then, the Steerable Pyramid Transform and the Weber Local Descriptor are employed to extract the feature vectors from the detected vehicles. Finally, the extracted features are given as the input to an ensemble deep learning technique for vehicle classification. In the simulation phase, the proposed ensemble deep learning technique obtained 99.13% and 99.28% of classification accuracy on the MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset and the Beijing Institute of Technology Vehicle Dataset. The obtained results are effective compared to the standard existing benchmark techniques on both datasets",'Hindawi Limited',Moving Vehicle Detection and Classification Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Ensemble Deep Learning Technique,10.1155/2021/5590894,,"[{'title': 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing', 'identifiers': ['issn:1530-8669', '1530-8677', 'issn:1530-8677', '1530-8669']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
441075277,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"A car-sharing system has been playing an important role as an alternative transport mode in order to avoid traffic congestion and pollution due to a quick growth of usage of private cars. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle relocation system with a major improvement in threefolds: (i) data preprocessing, (ii) demand forecasting, and (iii) relocation optimization. The data preprocessing is presented in order to automatically remove fake demands caused by search failures and application errors. Then, the real demand is forecasted using a deep learning approach, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit. Finally, the Minimum Cost Maximum Flow algorithm is deployed to maximize forecasted demands, while minimizing the amount of relocations. Furthermore, the system is deployed in the real use case, entitled “CU Toyota Ha:mo,” which is a car-sharing system in Chulalongkorn University. It is based on a web application along with rule-based notification via Line. The experiment was conducted based on the real vehicle usage data in 2019. By comparing in real environment in November of 2019, the results show that our model even outperforms the manual relocation by experienced staff.

480188131,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The automotive sector digitalization accelerates the technology convergence of perception, computing processing, connectivity, propulsion, and data fusion for electric connected autonomous and shared (ECAS) vehicles. This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios. ECAS vehicles, systems, sub-systems, and components are subjected to stringent regulatory frameworks, which set rigorous requirements for autonomous vehicles. An in-depth assessment of existing standards, regulations, and laws, including a thorough gap analysis, is required. Global guidelines must be provided on how to fulfill the requirements. ECAS vehicle technology trustworthiness, including AI-based HW/SW and algorithms, is necessary for developing ECAS systems across the entire automotive ecosystem. The safety and transparency of AI-based technology and the explainability of the purpose, use, benefits, and limitations of AI systems are critical for fulfilling trustworthiness requirements. The article presents ECAS vehicles’ evolution toward domain controller, zonal vehicle, and federated vehicle/edge/cloud-centric based on distributed intelligence in the vehicle and infrastructure level architectures and the role of AI techniques and methods to implement the different autonomous driving and optimization functions for sustainable green mobility",'Frontiers Media SA',Automotive Intelligence Embedded in Electric Connected Autonomous and Shared Vehicles Technology for Sustainable Green Mobility,10.3389/ffutr.2021.688482,https://core.ac.uk/download/480188131.pdf,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:2673-5210', '2673-5210']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Cultural Heritage around the globe suffers from wars, natural disasters and human negligence. The importance of digital documentation is well recognized and there is an increasing pressure to document our heritage both nationally and internationally. For this reason, the three-dimensional scanning and modeling of sites and artifacts of cultural heritage have remarkably increased in recent years. The semantic segmentation of point clouds is an essential step of the entire pipeline; in fact, it allows to decompose complex architectures in single elements, which are then enriched with meaningful information within Building Information Modelling software. Notwithstanding, this step is very time consuming and completely entrusted on the manual work of domain experts, far from being automatized. This work describes a method to label and cluster automatically a point cloud based on a supervised Deep Learning approach, using a state-of-the-art Neural Network called PointNet++. Despite other methods are known, we have choose PointNet++ as it reached significant results for classifying and segmenting 3D point clouds. PointNet++ has been tested and improved, by training the network with annotated point clouds coming from a real survey and to evaluate how performance changes according to the input training data. It can result of great interest for the research community dealing with the point cloud semantic segmentation, since it makes public a labelled dataset of CH elements for further tests",'Copernicus GmbH',Deep learning for semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud.,10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W15-735-2019,https://core.ac.uk/download/270202347.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A recurrent neural network approach, named RNN-LF, is then proposed to predict the long-term of flows from multiple data sources. Moreover, a parallel implementation on GPU of the proposed solution is developed (GRNN-LF), which allows to boost the performance of RNN-LF. Several experiments have been carried out on real traffic flow including a small city (Odense, Denmark) and a very big city (Beijing). The results reveal that the sequential version (RNN-LF) is capable of dealing effectively with traffic of small cities.

Digital avatars – sometimes also called Digital Twins or more broadly Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) – are already successfully used in holistic systems for intelligent transport ecosystems, similar to the use of Big Data and artificial intelligence technologies interwoven with modern production and supply chains. The goal of this paper is to describe how data from interwoven, autonomous and intelligent supply chains can be integrated into the diverse data ecosystems of the Industry 4.0, influenced by a multitude of data exchange formats and varied data schemas. In this paper, we describe how a framework for supporting SMEs was established in the Lake Constance region and describe a demonstrator sprung from the framework. The demonstrator project’s goal is to exhibit and compare two different approaches towards optimisation of manufacturing lines. The first approach is based upon static optimisation of production demand, i.e. exact or heuristic algorithms are used to plan and optimise the assignment of orders to individual machines. In the second scenario, we use real-time situational awareness – implemented as digital avatar – to assign local intelligence to jobs and raw materials in order to compare the results to the traditional planning methods of scenario one.

Crowd management stands for the decisions and actions taken to supervise and control densely populated spaces and it involves multiple challenges, from recognition and assessment to application of actions tailored to the current situation. To that end, Wi-Fi-based monitoring systems have emerged as a cost-effective solution for the former one. The key challenge that they impose is the requirement to handle large datasets and provide results in near real-time basis. However, traditional big data and event processing approaches have important shortcomings while dealing with crowd management information. In this paper, we describe a novel system architecture for real-time crowd recognition for smart cities and smart buildings that can be easily replicated.

The use of flying platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, is rapidly growing. In particular, with their inherent attributes such as mobility, flexibility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs admit several key potential applications in wireless systems. On the one hand, UAVs can be used as aerial base stations to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless communications is presented. Moreover, the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly investigated. In particular, the key UAV challenges such as 3D deployment, performance analysis, channel modeling, and energy efficiency are explored along with representative results. Then, open problems and potential research directions pertaining to UAV communications are introduced. Finally, various analytical frameworks and mathematical tools, such as optimization theory, machine learning, stochastic geometry, transport theory, and game theory are described. The use of such tools for addressing unique UAV problems is also presented.

The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection. The detected results were compared with a template of parking spaces and IoU value is used to identify vehicle occupancy information",'Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)',Deep learning-based vehicle occupancy detection in an open parking lot using thermal camera,10.1049/iet-its.2019.0468,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By the time of this article, most states have mandated face masking in public space. Therefore, real-time face mask detection becomes an essential application to prevent the spread of the pandemic. This study will present a face mask detection system that can detect and monitor mask-wearing from camera feeds and alert when there is a violation. The face mask detection algorithm uses a haar cascade classifier to find facial features from the camera feed and then utilizes it to detect the mask-wearing status. With the increasing number of cases all over the world, a system to replace humans to check masks on the faces of people is greatly needed. This system satisfies that need. This system can be employed in public places like transport stations and malls. It will be of great help in companies and huge establishments where there will be a lot of workers.   Alongside this, we have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output the presence or absence of a face mask in an image or a video stream. Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data with 100 percent and 99 percent precision and recall, respectively. We are making a savvy framework that will identify whether the specific user has worn the mask or not and further tell the accuracy level of the detection. Our framework will be python and AI-based which will be safe and quick for implementation.  This system will be of great help there because it is easy to obtain and store the data of the employees working in that Company and will very easily find the people who are not wearing the mask and a will be  sent to that respective person to take Precautions not wearing a mask.

A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elderly and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence, and life quality. In this sense, we propose IoTE-Fall system, an intelligent system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments that takes advantages of the Internet of Thing and the ensemble machine learning algorithm. IoTE-Fall system employs a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN wearable device capable of capturing in real time the data of the movements of elderly volunteers. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, in this paper, four machine learning algorithms (classifiers): decision trees, ensemble, logistic regression, and Deepnets are evaluated in terms of AUC ROC, training time and testing time. The acceleration readings are processed and analyzed at the edge of the network using an ensemble-based predictor model that is identified as the most suitable predictor for fall detection. The experiment results from collection data, interoperability services, data processing, data analysis, alert emergency service, and cloud services show that our system achieves accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity above 94%.Research presented in this article has been partially funded by Horizon 2020 European Project grant INTER-IoT no. 687283, ACTIVAGE project under grant agreement no. 732679, the Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Ecuador, and Secretaria de Educacion Superior Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT), Ecuador.Yacchirema, D.; Suárez De Puga, J.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

490966390,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Wastewater flow forecasts are key components in the short- and long-term management of sewer systems. Forecasting flows in sewer networks constitutes a considerable uncertainty for operators due to the nonlinear relationship between causal variables and wastewater flows. This work aimed to fill the gaps in the wastewater flow forecasting research by proposing a novel wastewater flow forecasting model (WWFFM) based on the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural network, real-time, and forecasted water consumption with an application to the sewer system of Casablanca in Morocco. Furthermore, this research compared the two approaches of the forecasting model. The first approach consists of forecasting wastewater flows on the basis of real-time water consumption and infiltration flows, and the second approach considers the same input in addition to water distribution flow forecasts. The results indicate that both approaches show accurate and similar performances in predicting wastewater flows, while the forecasting horizon does not exceed the watershed lag time. For prediction horizons that exceed the lag time value, the WWFFM with water distribution forecasts provided more reliable forecasts for long-time horizons. The proposed WWFFM could benefit operators by providing valuable input data for predictive models to enhance sewer system efficiency. HIGHLIGHTS

492651023,2021-10-26T00:00:00,"Neurological diseases may reduce Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle recruitment capacity causing gait disorders, such as drop foot (DF). The majority of DF patients still retain excitable nerves and muscles which makes Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) an adequate technique to restore lost mobility. Recent studies suggest the need for developing personalized and assist-as-needed control strategies for wearable FES in order to promote natural and functional movements while reducing the early onset of fatigue. This study contributes to a real-time implementation of a trajectory tracking FES control strategy for personalized DF correction. This strategy combines a feedforward Non-Linear Autoregressive Neural Network with Exogenous inputs (NARXNN) with a feedback PD controller. This control strategy advances with a user-specific TA muscle model achieved by the NARXNN’s ability to model dynamic systems relying on the foot angle and angular velocity as inputs. A closed-loop, fully wearable stimulation system was achieved using an ISTim stimulator and wearable inertial sensor for electrical stimulation and user’s kinematic gait sensing, respectively. Results showed that the NARXNN architecture with 2 hidden layers and 10 neurons provided the highest performance for modelling the kinematic behaviour of the TA muscle. The proposed trajectory tracking control revealed a low discrepancy between real and reference foot trajectories (goodness of fit = 77.87%) and time-effectiveness for correctly stimulating the TA muscle towards a natural gait and DF correction.This work has been supported by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) with the

The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. 

The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. 

SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets.

As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data {of an heating distribution network and power consumption data} collected in a major Italian city.

491193004,2022-01-06T06:30:30,"Traffic control optimization is a challenging task for various traffic centers around the world and the majority of existing approaches focus only on developing adaptive methods for normal (recurrent) traffic conditions. Optimizing the control plans when severe incidents occur still remains an open problem, especially when a high number of lanes or entire intersections are affected. This paper presents a novel methodology for optimizing the traffic signal timings in signalized urban intersections, under non-recurrent traffic incidents. With the purpose of producing fast and reliable decisions, we combine the fast running Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and the reliable Genetic Algorithms (GA) into a single optimization framework. Firstly, we deploy a typical GA algorithm by considering the phase duration as the decision variable and the objective function as the total travel time in the network. We fine tune the GA for crossover, mutation, fitness calculation and obtain the optimal parameters. Secondly, we train several regression models to predict the total travel time in the studied traffic network, and select the best performing model which we further hyper-tune. Lastly, we propose a new algorithm BGA-ML combining the GA algorithm and the extreme-gradient decision-tree (XGBT), which is the best performing regression model, together in a single optimization framework. Comparison and results are generated by two experiments (one synthetic and one from real urban traffic network) and show that the new BGA-ML is much faster than the original GA algorithm and can reduce the total travel time by almost half when used under incident conditions",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Boosted Genetic Algorithm Using Machine Learning for Traffic Control Optimization,10.1109/tits.2021.3066958,http://hdl.handle.net/10453/152765,"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems', 'identifiers': ['1524-9050', '1558-0016', 'issn:1524-9050', 'issn:1558-0016']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237398591,2020-05-01T00:00:00,"A Digital Twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources, and to represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, the current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multi-tier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs which is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge was developed, which integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysing, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learnt and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices.

This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.The authors would like to thank the European Union for the project ""Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum"" (AI-SPRINT), with code 101016577, funded under the H2020 Framework Programme and also the regional government of the Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) for the project IDIFEDER/2018/032 (High-Performance Algorithms for the Modeling, Simulation and early Detection of diseases in Personalized Medicine), co-funded by the European Union ERDF funds (European Regional Development Fund) of the Comunitat Valenciana 2014-2020.Risco, S.; Moltó, G.; Naranjo-Delgado, DM.; Blanquer Espert, I.

The proposed approach considers a hierarchically distributed control plane, decoupled from the data plane, and uses vehicle location and control traffic load to perform controller assignment dynamically. We model the dynamic controller assignment problem as a multi-agent Markov game and solve it with cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results using real-world vehicle mobility traces show that the proposed approach outperforms existing ones by reducing control delay as well as packet loss.

479191448,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Abstract In this paper, the optimal demand response strategy of a commercial building‐based virtual power plant with real‐world implementation in heavily urbanised area is studied. Instead of modelling the decision‐making process as an optimisation problem, a reinforcement learning method is used to seek the optimal strategy, which could update its performance with minimal manpower manipulation. Specifically, the data collection from several commercial buildings, including hotel, shopping mall and office, in Huangpu district, Shanghai city is analysed to deploy the demand response program. Compared with the conventional demand response strategy based on optimisation, the learnt strategy does not rely on the forecasting information as input and could adapt to the changing demand response incentive automatically. It may not produce the best result every time, but can guarantee the benefit in a non‐deterministic way in long‐term operation.

At the same time, DSOs are asked to improve the network’s resilience, looking for a reduction in the frequency and impact of power outages caused by extreme weather events. The paper presents a machine learning GIS-based approach to estimate a secondary substation’s load profiles, even in those cases where monitoring sensors are not deployed. For this purpose, a large amount of data from different sources has been collected and integrated to describe secondary substation load profiles adequately. Based on real measurements of some secondary substations (medium-voltage to low-voltage interface) given by Unareti, the DSO of Milan, and georeferenced data gathered from open-source databases, unknown secondary substations load profiles are estimated.

With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events.

475070866,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Multi-class classification is one of the major challenges in machine learning and an ongoing research issue. Classification algorithms are generally binary, but they must be extended to multi-class problems for real-world application. Multi-class classification is more complex than binary classification. In binary classification, only the decision boundaries of one class are to be known, whereas in multiclass classification, several boundaries are involved. The objective of this investigation is to propose a metaheuristic, optimized, multi-level classification learning system for forecasting in civil and construction engineering. The proposed system integrates the firefly algorithm (FA), metaheuristic intelligence, decomposition approaches, the one-against-one (OAO) method, and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). The enhanced FA automatically fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the LSSVM to construct an optimized LSSVM classification model. Ten benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of the enhanced optimization algorithm. Two binary-class datasets related to geotechnical engineering, concerning seismic bumps and soil liquefaction, are then used to clarify the application of the proposed system to binary problems. Further, this investigation uses multi-class cases in civil engineering and construction management to verify the effectiveness of the model in the diagnosis of faults in steel plates, quality of water in a reservoir, and determining urban land cover. The results reveal that the system predicts faults in steel plates with an accuracy of 91.085%, the quality of water in a reservoir with an accuracy of 93.650%, and urban land cover with an accuracy of 87.274%. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, its predictive accuracy is compared with that of a non-optimized baseline model, single multi-class classification algorithms (sequential minimal optimization (SMO), the Multiclass Classifier, the Naïve Bayes, the library support vector machine (LibSVM) and logistic regression) and prior studies.

489426654,2021-11-11T13:35:59,"This is the author accepted manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this recordShared e-mobility services have been widely tested and piloted in cities across the globe, and already woven into the fabric of modern urban planning. This paper studies a practical yet important problem in those systems: how to deploy and manage their infrastructure across space and time, so that the services are ubiquitous to the users while sustainable in profitability. However, in real-world systems evaluating the performance of different deployment strategies and then finding the optimal plan is prohibitively expensive, as it is often infeasible to conduct many iterations of trial-and-error. We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation environment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility systems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the real-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the optimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the real-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search approach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative deployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a multi-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are used to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed loop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating better deployment plans in future iterations. The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively in our simulation environment, and experimental results show that it outperforms baselines e.g., human knowledge, and state-of-the-art heuristic-based optimization approaches in both service coverage and net revenue.Alan Turing InstituteEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Deployment Optimization for Shared e-Mobility Systems with Multi-agent Deep Neural Search,10.1109/TITS.2021.3125745,https://core.ac.uk/download/489426654.pdf,"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems', 'identifiers': ['1524-9050', 'issn:1524-9050']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
492648457,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"It is broadly accepted that network function virtualization will play a key role to meet the stringent and heterogeneous requirements of 5G networks. Although fully centralized approaches were initially proposed, they may impose unfeasible requirements over fronthaul links. Consequently, flexible functional split solutions are being fostered, where a central controller adapts the centralization level to current circumstances. In spite of the growing interest in this type of solutions, most of existing works focus on real implementation, while little attention has been paid so far to performance modeling. In this paper we propose a Markov Chain based controller model, which boils down to a Quasi-Birth-Death process. Under reasonable assumptions, this model provides expected values of buffer occupancy and the time frames would spend in the controller. In this sense, it aims to be a tool to support the allocation of computational resources of the virtualized entities. We validate the proposed model by comparing its results with those obtained by simulation, evincing an almost perfect match between both approaches.This work has been funded by the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, MINECO-FEDER) by means of the project FIERCE: Future Internet Enabled Resilient smart CitiEs (RTI2018-093475-AI00)",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',A Quasi-Birth-Death model for functional split in 5G controllers,10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500266,https://core.ac.uk/download/492648457.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In order to explore this capability, we identify three different levels of data absent scenarios, where TL techniques are applied among Deep Learning (DL) methods for traffic forecasting. Then, traditional batch learning is compared against TL based models using real traffic flow data, collected by deployed loops managed by the City Council of Madrid (Spain). In addition, we apply Online Learning (OL) techniques, where model receives an update after each prediction, in order to adapt to traffic flow trend changes and incrementally learn from new incoming traffic data. The obtained experimental results shed light on the advantages of transfer and online learning for traffic flow forecasting, and draw practical insights on their interplay with the amount of available training data at the location of interest",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Transfer Learning and Online Learning for Traffic Forecasting under Different Data Availability Conditions: Alternatives and Pitfalls,10.1109/itsc45102.2020.9294557.,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
441907616,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"Background and Aim: In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in poultry are still reported. The disease causes a decrease in egg production and an increase in mortality; this has an impact on the economic losses of farmers. Several studies have considered that ducks play a role in the HPAI endemicity in the country; however, little is known about whether or not the type of duck farming is associated with HPAI H5 virus infection, particularly within clade 2.3.2.1c, which has been predominantly found in poultry since 2014. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the HPAI seroprevalence for H5 subtype clade 2.3.2.1c in laying ducks that are kept intensively and nomadically and to determine the associated risk factors.



Materials and Methods: Forty-nine duck farmers were randomly selected from ten sub-districts in Purbalingga District, Central Java, Indonesia; a cross-sectional study was implemented to collect field data. Based on an expected HPAI prevalence level of 10%, estimated accuracy of ± 5%, and 95% confidence interval (CI), the total sample size was calculated at 36 individuals. Samples must be multiplied by 7 to reduce bias; thus, 252 ducks were taken as samples in this study. Considering that the maintenance and duck handling were uniform and farmers complained that the effect of activity to take duck samples would reduce egg production, this study only took samples from 245 ducks (oropharyngeal swabs and serum). Those samples were taken from five birds on each farm. Hemagglutination inhibition tests examined the serum samples for HPAI H5 Clade 2.3.2.1c, and pool swab samples (five swabs in one viral media transport) were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test for influenza Type A and H5 subtype virus. Information regarding farm management was obtained using a questionnaire; face-to-face interviews were conducted with the duck farmers using native Javanese language.



Results: Serum and swabs from 245 ducks were collected in total. For individual birds, 54.69% (134/245) of serum samples were H5 seropositive. Seroprevalence among nomadic ducks was 59.28% (95% CI: 0.48-0.61), which was higher than among intensively farmed ducks (48.57%, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58). Farm-level seroprevalence was 50% (95% CI: 0.30-0.69) for nomadic ducks but only 28.57% (95% CI: 0.11-0.51) for intensively farmed ducks. The farm-level virus prevalence (proportion of flocks with at least one bird positive for influenza Type A) was 17.85% (95% CI: 0.07-0.35) for nomadic ducks and 4.76% (1/21) for intensively farmed ducks (95% CI: 0.008-0.23). All influenza Type A positive samples were negative for the H5 subtype, indicating that another HA subtype AI viruses might have been circulating in ducks in the study area. A relationship between duck farms that were H5 seropositive and their maintenance system was present; however, this relationship was not significant, the nomadic duck system detected 2 times higher H5-seropositive ducks than the intensive farming system (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 0.33-14.31).



Conclusion: This study found that the seroprevalence of HPAI in the duck population level in Purbalingga was 54.69% and demonstrated that the nomadic duck farming system was more likely to acquire HPAI H5 infection than the intensive farming duck system. Other risk factors should be further investigated as the diversity of the farming system is partially related to HPAI H5 infection",'Veterinary World',"Determining highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza clade 2.3.2.1c seroprevalence in ducks, Purbalingga, Central Java, Indonesia",10.14202/vetworld.2020.1138-1144,https://core.ac.uk/download/441907616.pdf,"[{'title': 'Veterinary World', 'identifiers': ['issn:2231-0916', '2231-0916', 'issn:0972-8988', '0972-8988']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of this case study was to provide insight into the lived reality of using the assistive robotic exoskeleton ReWalk.Method: We used ethnographic techniques to explore the everyday experience and use of the assistive robotic device.Results: We found that the appropriation and integration of the technology within the patient's everyday lives required a social and collaborative effort, which continued into use. The decisions to utilise the technology (or not) was closely tied to physical, social, cultural, environmental, and psychological factors. Consequently, there was much variation in patients' perception of the technology and opportunities for support. Four themes emerged:(a) Meaning of mobility—physical mobility represents more than functional ability. Its present socio-cultural meaning is associated with an individual's self-identity and life priorities.(b) Accomplishing body-technique—integration with the body requires a long process of skill acquisition and re-embodiment.(c) Adaptation and adjustment in use—successful use of the technology was characterised by ongoing adjustment and adaptation of the technology and ways of using it.(d) Human element—introduction and sustained use of the exoskeleton demand a social and collaborative effort across the user's professional and lay resources.Conclusions: This study highlights that the development and implementation of the technology need to be grounded in a deep understanding of the day-to-day lives and experiences of the people that use them",'Frontiers Media SA',Living With Assistive Robotics: Exploring the Everyday Use of Exoskeleton for Persons With Spinal Cord Injury,10.3389/fmedt.2021.747632,,"[{'title': 'Frontiers in Medical Technology', 'identifiers': ['issn:2673-3129', '2673-3129']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, a novel smart service-driven, adaptable middleware architecture is proposed to acquire, store, manipulate, and integrate information from heterogeneous data sources in order to deliver smart analytics aimed at supporting strategic decision-making. The architecture offers adaptive and scalable data integration services for acquiring and processing dynamic data, delivering fast response time, and offering data mining and machine learning models for real-time prediction, combined with advanced visualisation techniques.

In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

186351804,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Urban planning is central to flood risk prevention. Flood-sensitive urban planning pursues two goals: reducing flood exposure and vulnerability [1]; but also addressing the influence of urban characteristics on flood flow severity (flow depths and velocities) [2]. Focusing on the latter, we present here a unique software which automatically optimizes the geometry of urban layouts to enhance flood resilience [3]. The optimized parameters describe the arrangement of the road network, the blocks, the parcels, and the buildings. The proposed approach is particularly innovative since, so far, such automatic urban design tools were developed only for totally different objectives (e.g. optimizing sun exposure or distance to parks); but not in the context of flood risk management.
Our automatic urban design system consists of three components: (i) a procedural urban model, (ii) a surrogate for a hydraulic model and (iii) an optimization engine.
•	Starting from a set of input parameters pi (typical road length, width, curvature …) the procedural urban model generates urban layouts which mimic fairly realistically real-world urban patterns [3].
•	To achieve interactive feedback (i.e. getting the results within a few seconds), the system uses a neural network (NN) to approximate the relationship between urban layout and flood flow characteristics. The NN was trained using a relatively fast 2D porosity-based hydraulic model [4], which in turn was calibrated against a detailed shallow-water model [2].
•	A Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization is used to adjust iteratively the procedural model parameters pi so as to yield the desired urban layout.
The system was tested for optimizing the layout of an urban district of 1 km by 1 km subject to river flooding. The system runs about one minute to find the optimal urban layout. The system tends to improve the flow conveyance through the urban area by increasing the voids in-between the buildings (e.g., increase road width) and by promoting a more “fragmented” urban pattern (e.g., decrease road length). The optimization reduces the flood water depths in the district by up to 20 to 25%.
Several real-world examples showcase the operationality of the system for improving flood resilience through flood-sensitive urban design [3]. In practice, such an interactive digital tool can valuably assist urban planners and architects to assess the implications of various design decisions on flooding and end up with improved flood-sensitive urban layouts. The approach should be further developed to accommodate more diverse flooding scenarios (e.g. pluvial floods, coastal floods, etc.).

376010468,2020-11-24T00:00:00,"In the smart city context, Big Data analytics plays an important role in processing the

data collected through IoT devices. The analysis of the information gathered by sensors favors the

generation of specific services and systems that not only improve the quality of life of the citizens,

but also optimize the city resources. However, the difficulties of implementing this entire process

in real scenarios are manifold, including the huge amount and heterogeneity of the devices, their

geographical distribution, and the complexity of the necessary IT infrastructures. For this reason,

the main contribution of this paper is the PADL description language, which has been specifically

tailored to assist in the definition and operationalization phases of the machine learning life cycle.

It provides annotations that serve as an abstraction layer from the underlying infrastructure and

technologies, hence facilitating the work of data scientists and engineers. Due to its proficiency in the

operationalization of distributed pipelines over edge, fog, and cloud layers, it is particularly useful

in the complex and heterogeneous environments of smart cities. For this purpose, PADL contains

functionalities for the specification of monitoring, notifications, and actuation capabilities. In addition,

we provide tools that facilitate its adoption in production environments. Finally, we showcase the

usefulness of the language by showing the definition of PADL-compliant analytical pipelines over

two uses cases in a smart city context (flood control and waste management), demonstrating that

its adoption is simple and beneficial for the definition of information and process flows in such

environments.This work was partially supported by the SPRI–Basque Government through their ELKARTEK program

482691058,2021-11-11T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a relatively new concept that involves the merging of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT). It has emerged from the realization that Internet of Things networks could be further enhanced if they were also provided with Artificial Intelligence, enhancing the extraction of data and network operation. Prior to AIoT, the Internet of Things would consist of networks of sensors embedded in a physical environment, that collected data and sent them to a remote server. Upon reaching the server, a data analysis would be carried out which normally involved the application of a series of Artificial Intelligence techniques by experts. However, as Internet of Things networks expand in smart cities, this workflow makes optimal operation unfeasible. This is because the data that is captured by IoT is increasing in size continually. Sending such amounts of data to a remote server becomes costly, time-consuming and resource inefficient. Moreover, dependence on a central server means that a server failure, which would be imminent if overloaded with data, would lead to a halt in the operation of the smart service for which the IoT network had been deployed. Thus, decentralizing the operation becomes a crucial element of AIoT. This is done through the Edge Computing paradigm which takes the processing of data to the edge of the network. Artificial Intelligence is found at the edge of the network so that the data may be processed, filtered and analyzed there.  It is even possible to equip the edge of the network with the ability to make decisions through the implementation of AI techniques such as Machine Learning. The speed of decision making at the edge of the network means that many social, environmental, industrial and administrative processes may be optimized, as crucial decisions may be taken faster. 

Deep Intelligence is a tool that employs disruptive Artificial Intelligence techniques for data analysis i.e., classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to extract data from virtually any source type. This is a very important feature given the heterogeneity of the data being produced in the world today. Another very important characteristic is its intuitiveness and ability to operate almost autonomously.  The user is guided through the process which means that anyone can use it without any knowledge of the technical, technological and mathematical aspects of the processes performed by the platform. This means that the Deepint.net platform integrates functionalities that would normally take years to implement in any sector individually and that would normally require a group of experts in data analysis and related technologies [1-322]. 

The Deep Intelligence platform can be used to easily operate Edge Computing architectures and IoT networks. The joint characteristics of a well-designed Edge Computing platform (that is, one which brings computing resources to the edge of the network) and of the advanced Deepint.net platform deployed in a cloud environment, mean that high speed, real-time response, effective troubleshooting and management, as well as precise forecasting can be achieved. 

Moreover, the low cost of the solution, in combination with the availability of low-cost sensors, devices, Edge Computing hardware, means that deployment becomes a possibility for developing countries, where such solutions are needed most",,AIoT for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,,https://core.ac.uk/download/482691058.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The knowledge acquired from radio planning of previous generations must be revisited, particularly the used path loss and antennas models, as the 5G propagation is intrinsically distinct. This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements. After calibration, the MAE for LoS and NLoS decreased to 5.45 dB and 7.51 dB, respectively. Moreover, the non-calibrated 3GPP path loss model led to overestimations of the 5G coverage and user throughput up to 25&#x0025; and 163&#x0025;, respectively, when compared to the calibrated model predictions. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms resulted in path loss MAEs within the range of 4.58 dB to 5.38 dB, for LoS, and within the range of 3.70 dB to 5.96 dB, for NLoS, with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm attaining the lowest error",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Analysis and Optimization of 5G Coverage Predictions Using a Beamforming Antenna Model and Real Drive Test Measurements,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097633,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

213007942,2011,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium which is the causative agent of melioidosis, a common cause of fatal bacterial pneumonia and sepsis in the tropics. The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n =40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n =40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n =16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml. Comparison of isolates using multilocus sequence typing demonstrated clinical matches and close associations between environmental isolates and isolates derived from clinical samples from patients in Townsville. This study demonstrated that waterborne B. pseudomallei from groundwater seeps around Castle Hill may facilitate exposure to B. pseudomallei and contribute to the clinical clustering at this site.

235261716,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,https://core.ac.uk/download/235261716.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n = 40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n = 40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n = 16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml. Comparison of isolates using multilocus sequence typing demonstrated clinical matches and close associations between environmental isolates and isolates derived from clinical samples from patients in Townsville. This study demonstrated that waterborne B. pseudomallei from groundwater seeps around Castle Hill may facilitate exposure to B. pseudomallei and contribute to the clinical clustering at this site.

The ultimate focus is toward reducing the sensor count to just a single camera based on the single modality model. The capability of the sensor to detect and recognize on-the-road obstacles such as overtaking vehicle, pedestrians, signboards, bicycle, road lane marker and road curvature will be discussed.

FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI. 2018;5: 18.We present Oncilla robot, a novel mobile, quadruped legged locomotion machine. This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique potential as research tools to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures, i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom allow tight and swift direction changes, and turns on the spot. Presented hardware experiments are conducted in an open-loop manner, with little control and computational effort. For more versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be included for feedback control with an open communication protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion. It trots with a cost of transport of 3.2 J/(Nm),at a speed of 0.63 m s(-1) (Froude number 0.25). The robot trots inclined slopes up to 10 degrees, at 0.25 m s(-1). The multi-body Webots model of Oncilla robot, and Oncilla robot's extensive software architecture enables users to design and test scenarios in simulation.

Several studies have recently demonstrated that actions focused only on the water supply side of the problem (e.g., augmenting existing water supply infrastructure) will likely fail to meet future demands, thus calling for the concurrent deployment of effective water demand management strategies (WDMS) to pursue water savings and conservation. However, to be effective WDMS do require a substantial understanding of water consumers' behaviors and consumption patterns at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Retrieving information on users' behaviors, as well as their explanatory and/or causal factors, is key to spot potential areas for targeting water saving efforts and to design user-tailored WDMS, such as education campaigns and personalized recommendations. In this work, we contribute a data-driven approach to identify household water users' consumption behavioural profiles and model their water use habits. State-of-the-art clustering methods are coupled with big data machine learning techniques with the aim of extracting dominant behaviors from a set of water consumption data collected at the household scale. This allows identifying heterogeneous groups of consumers from the studied sample and characterizing them with respect to several consumption features. Our approach is validated onto a real-world household water consumption dataset associated with a variety of demographic and psychographic user data and household attributes, collected in nine towns of the Pilbara and Kimberley Regions of Western Australia. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the influence of candidate determinants on residential water consumption profiles and in attaining sufficiently accurate predictions of users' consumption behaviors, ultimately providing valuable information to water utilities and managers",,Data-driven behavioural modelling of residential water consumption to inform water demand management strategies,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Detecting smartphone usage is interesting for many reasons, from legal controls to forensics investigation in accidents, without forgetting the possibility of alert the driver of the danger he is engaging in. In this study we evaluate the pertinence of using driver head rotation movements to automatically predict smartphone usage at the wheel. In order to fit the system to the particularities of professional drivers, a naturalistic driving study have been conducted. 15 operational vehicles from two private French transport companies were equipped with near-infrared cameras, embedded real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques. Common behavioural patterns have been revealed. Head rebounds are a constant (letting the driver switch gaze between the road and the device). Additionally, the duration a driver spends looking down from a reference neutral direction can be used as a reliable parameter to predict smartphone usage. On the other hand some divergences between van and bus drivers head movements have been noticed. A real-time smartphone usage detection system has been implemented from the results of this study.

324084887,2017-08-01T00:00:00,"Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a valuable and well-established inversion technique
for the estimation of geophysical parameters from satellite images. After training, ANNs are able to generate very fast products for several types of applications. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient way to detect and map strong earthquake damage for contributing to post-disaster activities during emergency phases. This work aims at presenting an application of the ANN inversion technique addressed to the evaluation of building collapse ratio (CR), defined as the number of collapsed buildings with respect to the total number of buildings in a city block, by employing optical and SAR satellite data. This is done in order to directly relate changes in images with damage that has occurred during strong earthquakes. Furthermore, once they have been trained, neural networks can be used rapidly at application stage. The goal was to obtain a general tool suitable for re-use in different scenarios. An ANN has been implemented in order to emulate a regression model and to estimate the CR as a continuous function. The adopted ANN has been trained using some features obtained from optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, as inputs, and the corresponding values of collapse ratio obtained from the survey of the 2010 M7 Haiti Earthquake, i.e., as target output. As regards the optical data, we selected three change parameters: the Normalized Difference Index (NDI), the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD), and Mutual Information (MI). Concerning the SAR images, the Intensity Correlation Difference (ICD) and the KLD parameters have been considered. Exploiting an object-oriented approach, a segmentation of the study area into several regions has been performed. In particular, damage maps have been generated by considering a set of polygons (in which satellite parameters have been calculated) extracted from the open source Open Street Map (OSM) geo-database. The trained ANN has been proposed for the M6.0 Amatrice earthquake that occurred on 24 August 2016, in central Italy, by using the features extracted from Sentinel-2 and COSMO-SkyMed images as input. The results show that the ANN is able to retrieve a building collapse ratio with good accuracy. In particular, the fusion approach modelled the collapse ratio characterized by high values of CR (more than 0.5) over the historical center that agrees with observed damages. Since the technique is independent from different typologies of input data (i.e., for radiometric or spatial resolution characteristics), the study demonstrated the strength of the proposed approach for estimating damaged areas and its importance in near real time monitoring activities, owing to its fast application.Published7814T.

In this initiative, ISO 19152:2012 Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) has been taken as the basis for the development of a Valuation Information Model. A first version of the LADM Valuation Information Model was created based on standards, literature survey and data gained from questionnaires replied by the national delegates of FIG Commission 9 and FIG Commission 7. The conceptual model was represented through class diagrams of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This paper describes the development of a prototype for the implementation of the conceptual model in terms of a Turkish case study. The main ai m of this paper is to assess and improve the proposed conceptual LADM Valuation Information Model. In the development part, the classes, attributes, constraints, cardinalities and relations between classes of the conceptual model were converted to technical (physical) model, namely the Oracle Spatial 11g database schema has been generated from the conceptual model definitions. The conceptual schema definitions were implemented into the database, whi ch next was loaded with sample datasets related to property valuation and taxation in Turkey. The sample data includes valuation units that are the subjects of recurrently levied property taxes in Turkey, such as unimproved urban parcel and parcel and improvements together as condominium property, valuation and taxation information of the valuation units in different years, and as well as geometries of valuation units. The technical model of LADM Valuation Information Model Turkish Country Profile has been tested in evaluation phase through SQL queries and visualization tools, respectively.

However, in most geospatial applications the current literature does not elaborate on specifications of the SVM method with respect to data sampling, attribute selection and optimal parameters choices. Therefore the main objective of this study is to present and investigate the SVM technique for modeling urban land use change. The SVM model building procedure is presented together with the detailed evaluation of the output results with respect to the choice of datasets, attributes and the change of SVM parameters. Geospatial datasets containing nine land use classes and spatial attributes for the Municipality of Zemun, Republic of Serbia were used for years 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2011. The Correlation-based Feature Subset method, kappa coefficient, Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and kappa simulation were used to perform the model evaluation and compare the model outputs with the real land use datasets.

299434479,2015,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

AVs might represent a revolutionary new paradigm that can be a reality in our cities in the next few years. AVs do not need a driver to work; instead, they should copy a proper human behavior to adapt the driving according to the current circumstances, such as speed limit, pedestrian crossing street or wheather conditions. We will develop an AV software module including artificial intelligence (AI) techniques so that AVs can interact with the dynamic scenario throughout time. Finally, we also will include electrical vehicles (EV) in the VANET, so that special services such as finding and reserving an EV charging station place will be welcome.

The management of this large inventory of bicycles is a particularly challenging issue with the goal to ensure the demand for bicycles is met at all times across the network. To this end, an efficient scheduling approach is needed with the capacity to guide the redistribution of bicycles across the self-service stations. Drawing on 7 years of disaggregate trip data, this study first captures the usage dynamics across both space and time to extract the candidate stations and redistribution periods for vehicle scheduling. A region partition method with K-means clustering is proposed to satisfy the real-time requirement of large-scale PBSPs' redistribution. Moreover, drawing on the variations in demand a back-propagation neural network short-term prediction model is computed to inform the necessary prospective redistribution of bicycles to ensure demand is always met.

The purpose of this study was to develop a model that can effectively identify traffic conditions prone to crashes and support implementation of proactive traffic safety management. On the basis of crash data and the corresponding detector data collected on expressways of Shanghai, China, different combinations of dual-loop detector data and time segments before crashes were used to develop the optimal crash risk estimation model by SVM. The transferability of the SVM model was assessed by examining whether the model developed on one expressway was applicable to other similar ones. In addition, the prediction results and transferability of the SVM model were compared with those given by other frequently used classification algorithms, including logistic regression, Bayesian networks, naïve Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbor, and back propagation neural network. The results showed that the SVM model was more suitable to the prediction of real-time crash risk with small-scale data than other algorithms, with its accuracy in classifying crashes reaching a best of 80%.

36204601,2011-01-01T00:00:00,"In critical domains such as urban search and rescue (USAR), and bomb disposal, the deployment of teleoperated robots is essential to reduce the risk of first responder personnel. Teleoperation is a difficult task, particularly when controlling robots from an isolated safety zone. In general, the operator has to solve simultaneously the problems of mission planning, target identification, robot navigation, and robot control. We introduce a system to support teleoperated navigation with real-time mapping consisting of a two-step scan matching method that re-considers data associations during the search. The algorithm processes data from laser range finder and gyroscope only, thereby it is independent from the robot platform. Furthermore, we introduce a user-guided procedure for improving the global consistency of maps generated by the scan matcher. Globally consistent maps are computed by a graph-based maximum likelihood method that is biased by localizing crucial parts of the scan matcher trajectory on a prior given geo-tiff image. The approach has been implemented as an embedded system and extensively tested on robot platforms designed for teleoperation in critical situations, such as bomb disposal. Furthermore, the system was evaluated in a test maze by first responders during the Disaster City event in Texas 2008.Artificial Intelligence & Integrated Computer System",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Mapping for the Support of First Responders in Critical Domains,10.1007/s10846-010-9520-x,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

327184530,,"Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Tensor Voting Techniques and Applications in Mobile Trace Inference,10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2512380.,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

389907284,2015-12-17T00:00:00,"Objective. This paper presents the selective particle swarm optimization and results of it applying to solve a problem of the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously for a real distribution system with 3 substations, 37 feeders, 274 buses, 284 branches and 11 normally open switches located in the eastern part of Mariupol city. Technique. Selective particle swarm optimization as a simple modification of the binary particle swarm optimization to search in a selected decision space was used for solving the aforesaid problem formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer combinatorial nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a plenty of test systems and real schemes with the different number of buses were used and selective particle swarm optimization was compared to another modern heuristic and artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony search algorithm, fuzzy-reasoning approach, etc.). MATLAB R2010a was applied as a computational tool to realize the proposed algorithm for modeling of the real large-scale distribution system. Before starting simulation, the long-term measurements (during one week) of the active and reactive power, power factor, voltage distortion and unbalance were made by Fluke 435 power quality analyzer on the four feeders with the highest active power losses and voltage drop. Results. Simulation results before and after optimization demonstrated an effectiveness of the selective particle swarm optimization in reducing the both active power and energy losses, improving the voltage quality and receiving the total annual saving. A comparative study of the three abovementioned techniques (capacitor placement, reconfiguration and reconductoring) to optimize a performance of the large-scale distribution system was executed. Scientific novelty. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for an optimization procedure of the real large-scale distribution system to find the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously accounting for technical constraints (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits, maximum total harmonic distortion limit and maximum permissible total size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure). Practical value. For investigated distribution system, applying of all three optimization techniques simultaneously with THD constraint would be reduce the active power losses from 7.4 % to 3.5 % and energy losses – from 5 % to 2.38 % (approximately twice). In this case, the total annual saving would be about $700000 and the total saving for remaining period – about $4.8 million.Цель. В работе приведены селективный метод роя частиц и результаты его применения для решения проблемы совместной оптимизации мест установки и мощности батарей конденсаторов, конфигурации и сечений проводников реальной распределительной сети, которая содержит 3 подстанции, 37 фидеров, 274 узла, 284 ветви и 11 нормально разомкнутых коммутационных аппаратов, и расположена в восточной части города Мариуполь. Методика. Селективный метод роя частиц, представляющий собой простую модификацию бинарного метода роя частиц, предназначенную для поиска в выбранном пространстве решений, был использован для решения вышеуказанной проблемы, сформулированной как проблема многокритериальной частично целочисленной комбинаторной нелинейной оптимизации с ограничениями в виде равенств и неравенств. Для подтверждения эффективности предложенного алгоритма были использованы многочисленные тестовые и реальные схемы с различным количеством узлов, а селективный метод роя частиц сравнили с другими современными эвристическими методами и методами искусственного интеллекта (например, имитация отжига, генетические алгоритмы, алгоритм колонии муравьёв, нечёткая логика и др.). Чтобы реализовать предложенный алгоритм для моделирования реальной разветвлённой сети, в качестве вычислительного средства была использована среда MATLAB R2010a. Перед началом моделирования с помощью анализатора качества электроэнергии Fluke 435 на четырёх фидерах с наибольшими потерями активной мощности и падением напряжения были проведены длительные (в течение одной недели) измерения активной и реактивной мощности, коэффициента мощности, несинусоидальности и несимметрии напряжений. Результаты. Результаты моделирования до и после оптимизации продемонстрировали эффективность применения селективного метода роя частиц для снижения потерь активной мощности и электроэнергии, улучшения качества напряжения и получения суммарной годовой экономии. Выполнено сравнительное исследование трёх приведенных выше методов оптимизации параметров разветвлённой распределительной сети (установка батарей конденсаторов, реконфигурация и замена сечений проводников).

Практическая значимость. Применение для исследуемой распределительной сети всех трёх методов оптимизации одновременно с учётом ограничения на максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению позволило бы снизить потери активной мощности с 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а потери электроэнергии – с 5 % до 2,38 % (примерно в 2 раза).

Селективний метод рою частинок, який є простою модифікацією бінарного методу рою частинок, призначеною для пошуку у обраному просторі розв'язань, був застосований щодо вирішення зазначеної вище проблеми, сформульованої як проблема багатокритеріальної частково цілочислової комбінаторної нелінійноїоптимізації з обмеженнями у вигляді рівностей та нерівностей. Для підтвердження ефективності запропонованого алгоритму були використані численні тестові та реальні схеми з різною кількістю вузлів, а селективний метод рою частинок був порівняний з іншими сучасними евристичними методами та методами штучного інтелекту (наприклад, імітація відпалу, генетичні алгоритми, алгоритм колонії мурашів, нечітка логіка та ін.). Щоби реалізувати запропонований алгоритм для моделювання реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі, у якості обчислювального засобу було застосовано середовище MATLAB R2010a. Перед початком моделювання за допомогою аналізатору якості електроенергії Fluke 435 на чотирьох фідерах з найбільшими втратами активної потужності та спадом напруги були виконані тривалі (протягом одного тижня) вимірювання активної та реактивної потужності, коефіцієнту потужності, несинусоїдності та несиметрії напруг. Результати. Результати моделювання до та після оптимізації продемонстрували ефективність застосування селективного методу рою частинок для зниження втрат активної потужності та електроенергії, покращення якості напруги та отримання сумарної річної економії. Виконано порівняльне дослідження трьох зазначених вище методів оптимізації параметрів розгалуженої розподільної мережі (встановлення батарей конденсаторів, реконфігурація та заміна перерізів провідників). Наукова новизна. Запропонований алгоритм був реалізований для оптимізації параметрів реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі з метою спільного знаходження оптимальних місць встановлення та потужності батарей конденсаторів, конфігурації та перерізів провідників, враховуючи технічні обмеження (максимально припустимий струм, максимально та мінімально припустимі напруги, максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою та максимально припустиме значення сумарної встановленої потужності батарей конденсаторів) та експлуатаційні обмеження (відсутність вимкнених навантажень та радіальна структура мережі). Практична значимість. Застосування для досліджуваної розподільної мережі всіх трьох методів оптимізації разом з урахуванням обмеження на максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою дозволило би знизити втрати активної потужності з 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а втрати електроенергії – з 5 % до 2,38 % (приблизно у 2 рази).

132513871,2017,"Over the last few years, standardisation efforts are consolidating the role of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) as the standard routing protocol for IPv6-based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Although many core functionalities are well defined, others are left implementation dependent. Among them, the definition of an efficient link-quality estimation (LQE) strategy is of paramount importance, as it influences significantly both the quality of the selected network routes and nodesâ\u80\u99 energy consumption. In this paper, we present RL-Probe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in RPL, which accurately measures link quality with minimal overhead and energy waste. To achieve this goal, RL-Probe leverages both synchronous and asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility. Our solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring procedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing operations. The performance of the proposed solution is assessed by means of simulations and real experiments.

154896622,2017-11-16T00:00:00,"With the development of intelligent transportation systems, the estimation of traffic flow in urban areas has attracted a great attention of researchers. The timely and accurate travel information of urban residents could assist users in planning their travel strategies and improve the operational efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Currently, the origin-destination (OD) flows of urban residents are formulated as an OD matrix, which is used to denote the travel patterns of urban residents. In this paper, a simple and effective model, called NMF-AR, is proposed for predicting the OD matrices through combining the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm and the Autoregressive (AR) model. The basic characteristics of travel flows are first revealed based on the NMF algorithm. Then, the nonlinear time series coefficient matrix, extracted from the NMF algorithm, is estimated based on the AR model. Finally, we predict OD matrices based on the estimated coefficient matrix and the basis matrix of NMF. Extensive experiments have been implemented, in collected real data about taxi GPS information in Beijing, for comparing our proposed algorithm with some known methods, such as different kinds of $K$-nearest neighbor algorithms, neural network algorithms and classification algorithms. The results show that our proposed NMF-AR algorithm have a more effective capability in predicting OD matrices than other models",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',A hybrid algorithm for estimating origin-destination flows,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2774449,http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30107022/zhang-hybridalgorithm-2018.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
185549869,2018,"The characterization of the melting layer (ML) is an important task for operational radar meteorology. Melting layer identification may be used to establish distances at which radar rainfall estimates become affected by melting hydrometeors, with benefits for operational hydrometeor classification, as snowfall, freezing rain and liquid precipitation. Consequently, this yields a significant performance improvement in radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) on ground. Furthermore, knowledge of the ML location is also important for microphysical cloud characterization and the evaluation of icing potential. Several studies and algorithms exist in literature for characterizing ML through radar measurement signature, the most popular being the increase in the radar reflectivity factor known as bright. For dual polarization radar, ML detection can be pursued using specific signatures of dual polarization measurements, such as differential reflectivity ZDR, co-polar correlation coefficient \rhoHV , specific differential phase KDP, and linear depolarization ratio LDR that exhibit well-pronounced ML signatures both in stratiform and even in convective situations. Moreover, ML and rainfall have a strong influence on satellite links signals, as they are attenuated due to the presence of hydrometeors along the propagation path. In stratiform precipitation systems, the ML is the upper limit of the rainfall column height that is responsible of the attenuation of radio signals. Therefore, ML climatology is proficiently used for designing satellites links relative to a specific area. Very recently, a new X-band Doppler, dual-polarization weather radar system has been installed in Florence funded by the Tuscany Region Government within the NEFOCAST project. The latter investigates a new concept system that aims at providing real time precipitation maps trough the attenuation measurements collected by a dense population of new-generation interactive satellite terminals (called SmartLNB, Smart Low-Noise Block converter). A number of SmartLNB has been deployed in the Tuscany region and a test bed has been established in cooperation with the schools of the Florence Metropolitan city. In the present study, the potential of the new weather radar system is investigated for characterizing the ML in terms of height and thickness under different meteorological conditions and cloud systems. Measurements collected in the RangeHeight Indicator (RHI) scan mode along the direction to the Eutelsat 10A satellite (used for the experimental campaign of the NEFOCAST project) have been analysed with the simultaneous attenuation estimation obtained by the SmartLNBs with radar coverage during selected precipitative events. Statistical analyses have been performed based on both weather radar and SmartLNB measurements, supplemented by ancillary observations from some rain gauges (both impact and tipping-bucket types) co-located with SmartLNBs. In addition, a C-band radar system (Polar 55C) located in Rome has also been used for this work. Polar 55C dual polarization measurements have been analysed with respect to co-located SmartLNBs and laser disdrometer. The results of this analysis highlight the effects of ML on radio signal attenuation, as the total attenuation of signal increases also with the increase of ML vertical thickness. Therefore, the characterization of the vertical profile of precipitation is mandatory for implementing accurate QPE on ground, both from radars and satellite links",'Wageningen University and Research',Studies of the melting layer of precipitative systems using X-band dual polarization weather radar and SmartLNB network,10.18174/454537,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
58800040,2012-09-01T00:00:00,"Traffic accidents are still one of the main health problems in the World. A number of measures have been applied in order to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities in roads, i.e., implementation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based on image processing. In this paper, a real time speed supervisor based on road sign recognition that can work both in urban and non-urban environments is presented. The system is able to recognize 135 road signs, belonging to the danger, yield, prohibition obligation and indication types, and sends warning messages to the driver upon the combination of two pieces of information: the current speed of the car and the road sign symbol. The core of this paper is the comparison between the two main methods which have been traditionally used for detection and recognition of road signs: template matching (TM) and neural networks (NN). The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches will be shown and commented. Additionally we will show how the use of well-known algorithms to avoid illumination issues reduces the amount of images needed to train a neural network.The work reported in this article has been partly funded by the Spanish Government by the grants

300333150,2016,"Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning (ML) algorithm commonly applied to the classification of remotely sensing data and more recently for modeling land use changes. However, in most geospatial applications the current literature does not elaborate on specifications of the SVM method with respect to data sampling, attribute selection and optimal parameters choices. Therefore the main objective of this study is to present and investigate the SVM technique for modeling urban land use change. The SVM model building procedure is presented together with the detailed evaluation of the output results with respect to the choice of datasets, attributes and the change of SVM parameters. Geospatial datasets containing nine land use classes and spatial attributes for the Municipality of Zemun, Republic of Serbia were used for years 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2011. The Correlation-based Feature Subset method, kappa coefficient, Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and kappa simulation were used to perform the model evaluation and compare the model outputs with the real land use datasets. The obtained results indicate that the SVM-based models perform better when implementing balanced data sampling, reduced data sets to informative subsets of attributes and properly identify the optimal learning parameters",Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Modeling Urban Land Use Changes Using Support Vector Machines,10.1111/tgis.12174,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1361-1682', '1361-1682']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

275634114,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay communications networks have emerged as a new paradigm for implementing distributed services in microgrids due to their potential benefits: they are robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, and they can route messages even with a large number of nodes which are frequently entering or leaving from the network. However, current P2P systems have been mainly developed for file sharing or cycle sharing applications where the processes of searching and managing resources are not optimized. Locality algorithms have gained a lot of attention due to their potential to provide an optimized path to groups with similar interests for routing messages in order to get better network performance. This paper develops a fully functional decentralized communication architecture with a new P2P locality algorithm and a specific protocol for monitoring and control of microgrids. Experimental results show that the proposed locality algorithm reduces the number of lookup messages and the lookup delay time. Moreover, the proposed communication architecture heavily depends of the lookup used algorithm as well as the placement of the communication layers within the architecture. Experimental results will show that the proposed techniques meet the network requirements of smart microgrids even with a large number of nodes on stream.This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant ENE2015-64087-C2-2R.

cities paradigm. One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of whatif decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems. We demonstrate that the use of graphs and time series in multi-dimensional data models can satisfy the requirements of descriptive and predictive analytics in real-world case studies with massive amounts of continuously changing data. The features of the framework are explained in a case study of a complex collaborative mobility system that combines carpooling, carsharing and shared parking. The performance of the framework is tested with a large-scale dataset, performing machine learning tasks and interactive realtime data visualization.

161678999,2017,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The main results observed are as follows: - A high proportion of consumers consider AI to be a food-related risk. However, over time, there has been a slight shift from a fear of consuming poultry to a fear of preparing it (slaughtering it). - AI has had a profound effect on poultry consumption, even outside peak crisis times, more in terms of the quantity consumed (approximately a third less in 2006) than in terms of the number of consumers (6% less). - Blood and internal organs are considered particularly risky, while eggs are viewed as being safer. Poultry from industrial farms is considered to be more risky than poultry from small farms. - Purchasing practices have also been affected by AI: in Hanoi, consumers declare that they prefer to buy poultry directly from producers that they know, or from supermarkets in the case of the wealthiest consumers. A high proportion still buy live poultry from market traders, but more consumers now ask sellers to slaughter it for them. With a view to lessening market shocks in the wake of the crisis while maintaining the priority of consumer safety, a number of measures should nevertheless be implemented: Risk communication should not over-emphasize AI as a food-related risk. - Reliable safe distribution channels should be promoted (with reliable quality signs and controls) in order to encourage safe production and poultry consumption. Otherwise, a market recovery will only benefit supermarkets and large-scale farmers capable of supplying supermarkets. - As numerous live birds are still slaughtered in urban market places, facilities should be provided for safe slaughter. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the provision of a real ""cold chain"" with a view to promoting the sale of slaughtered poultry.

226063288,2015,"In lab-on-chip for food analysis, dealing with large samples with complex composition (i.e. the matrix) and target analytes potentially in very low concentrations is one of major issues that needs to be tackled. In order to increase the analytical accuracy of a method, it is often required to process the sample before quantification of the chemical specie under examination. In milk case, the presence of fat, proteins and many other components in a complex phase equilibrium poses particular challenges for analysis. Caseins, in particular, are known as blocking agent for surfaces, and therefore may interact with sensor surfaces. Many methods are available for microfluidic processing [1], but they are usually developed for small samples (often blood). Scaling up processing rate to deal with 1-100ml samples in minutes is not practical in most cases. In milk, casein is usually found in micelles the size of about 50-300nm [2], formed by hydrophobic caseins complexed by calcium ions and enclosed by partially hydrophilic k-casein. Since isoelectric point of casein is 4.6, at milk pH there is an intrinsic negative charge, which can be used to separate it from the sample. Other options include size and density separation in microfluidic structure as for instance acoustic separation.

In this paper, we present the development of a high-throughput electrophoretic separation system for milk proteins allowing the separation of casein at flow rates in the range of mls/min, by exploiting the intrinsic charge of casein at milk pH (i.e. 6.6). The device is intended as a step for sample preparation to increase the accuracy of detection of contaminants in milk samples. Design, estimated performances and implementation of the device for the experimental evaluation of the approach are reported. We preliminary focused on BSA, lactoglobulins and caseins as model molecules. An electrophoretic mobility of -1.39µm cm V-1 s-1 was measured for casein in conditions as close as possible to real sample (typical ionic strength of milk 0.08M, pH 6.6). The range of flow rate suitable for separation can be estimated by the velocity of electrophoretic drag and flow velocity. Modelling of device provided the evaluation of optimal working conditions and design (potential and flow rate); with a maximum applied potential of 1.4V, the expected fractionation of proteins between the two outlets is reported in Fig. 1, where 0.5 is equivalent to no separation.

The device was implemented with platinum electrodes lithographed on silica glass wafers with semi-transparent grid pattern for inspection. In order to increase the throughput, we designed a separation chamber with large cross section (Fig. 2), where electrodes are facing on top and bottom walls of a chamber with width 4mm and channel height 510µm. Electrodes are 28 mm long. Electric field applied drags charged particle toward the upper or lower walls depending on charge. The fluidic chamber was fabricated by 3D printing in PVC and assembled using two shells machined to house the electrode chips (Fig. 3).

Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample.

The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n = 40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n = 40).

The implementation of a CNN requires several parameter restrictions with respect to the universal concept. For instance, the number representation and the cloning template are often confined to respectively 8 bits and a neighborhood of 1. It has been shown that optimal (i.e. minimal level) CNN architectures as derived from a morphological specification of the desired operation lead to arbitrarily large templates. A subsequent transformation step can turn this into a sequence of smaller templates for a specified hardware platform. The existence of a generic platform that can already handle the universal CNN architecture for prototyping and verification eliminates this need for technology-driven performance degradation. The proposed packet switcher consists of a physical layer where the CNN nodal function is performed, a data-link layer where the nodal data are maintained, a network layer with the packet receiver and sender and the actual switch as element of the transport layer. This ISO/OSI compliant level-wise structure monitors the network parameters and autonomously adjusts for the size of the neighborhood. It separates the broadcast of the network variables from the actual computation, allowing each to be executed at its own speed.

METHODS/DESIGN: The Psychosis early Intervention and Assessment of Needs and Outcome (PIANO) trial is part of a larger research program (Genetics, Endophenotypes and Treatment: Understanding early Psychosis - GET UP) which aims to compare, at 9 months, the effectiveness of a multi-component psychosocial intervention versus treatment as usual (TAU) in a large epidemiologically based cohort of patients with FEP and their family members recruited from all public community mental health centers (CMHCs) located in two entire regions of Italy (Veneto and Emilia Romagna), and in the cities of Florence, Milan and Bolzano. The GET UP PIANO trial has a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled design. The randomized units (clusters) are the CMHCs, and the units of observation are the centers' patients and their family members. Patients in the experimental group will receive TAU plus: 1) cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, 2) psycho-educational sessions for family members, and 3) case management. Patient enrollment will take place over a 1-year period. Several psychopathological, psychological, functioning, and service use variables will be assessed at baseline and follow-up. The primary outcomes are: 1) change from baseline to follow-up in positive and negative symptoms' severity and subjective appraisal; 2) relapse occurrences between baseline and follow-up, that is, episodes resulting in admission and/or any case-note records of re-emergence of positive psychotic symptoms. The expected number of recruited patients is about 400, and that of relatives about 300. Owing to the implementation of the intervention at the CMHC level, the blinding of patients, clinicians, and raters is not possible, but every effort will be made to preserve the independency of the raters. We expect that this study will generate evidence on the best treatments for FEP, and will identify barriers that may hinder its feasibility in 'real-world' clinical settings, patient/family conditions that may render this intervention ineffective or inappropriate, and clinical, psychological, environmental, and service organization predictors of treatment effectiveness, compliance, and service satisfaction.Ruggeri M, Bonetto C, Lasalvia A, De Girolamo G, Fioritti A, Rucci P, Santonastaso P, Neri G, Pileggi F, Ghigi D, Miceli M, Scarone S, Cocchi A, Torresani S, Faravelli C, Zimmermann C, Meneghelli A, Cremonese C, Scocco P, Leuci E, Mazzi F, Gennarelli M, Brambilla P, Bissoli S, Bertani ME, Tosato S, De Santi K, Poli S, Cristofalo D, Tansella M; GET UP GROUP, Ruggeri M, Mirella ME, Bissoli S, Bonetto C, Cristofalo D, De Santi K, Lasalvia A, Lunardi S, Negretto V, Poli S, Tosato S, Zamboni MG, Ballarin M, De Girolamo G, Fioritti A, Neri G, Pileggi F, Rucci P, Bocchio Chiavetto L, Scasselatti C, Zanardini R, Brambilla P, Bellani M, Bertoldo A, Marinelli V, Negretto V, Perlini C, Rambaldelli G, Lasalvia A, Bertani M, Bissoli S, Lazzarotto L, Bardella S, Gardellin F, Lamonaca D, Lasalvia A, Lunardon M, Magnabosco R, Martucci M, Nicolau S, Nifosì F, Pavanati M, Rossi M, Piazza C, Piccione G, Sala A, Sale A, Stefan B, Zotos S, Balbo M, Boggian I, Ceccato E, Dall'Agnola R, Gardellin F, Girotto B, Goss C, Lamonaca D, Lasalvia A, Leoni R, Mai A, Pasqualini A, Pavanati M, Piazza C,

275613444,2015-11-18T00:00:00,"12th International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization, and Engineering, CDVE 2015; Mallorca; Spain; 20 September 2015 through 23 September 2015The proper transport of hit sensitive products, such as fish and fruit,
is very important because their deterioration may cause the value lost and even
the product rejection by the buyer. For this reason, in this paper we present a
cooperative monitoring system for the delivery of fresh products. The system
consists of fixed wireless nodes and a mobile wireless node that is installed in
the packet. This mobile node is able to take data of the internal temperature,
external temperature and the 3 axis movement. With the information stored in
the network, a vendor can know the optimal conditions of the transport. Finally,
we test the maximum distance to the fixed nodes, as well as the data collected by
the sensor.Sendra, S.; Lloret, J.; Lacuesta, R.; Jimenez, JM. (2015). Cooperative Monitoring of the Delivery of Fresh Products.
