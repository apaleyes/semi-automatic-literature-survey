475059757,2021-07-01T00:00:00,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely adopted in recent years, but often include a high proportion of missing data, which can create difficulties in implementing machine learning and other tools of personalized medicine. Completed datasets are preferred for a number of analysis methods, and successful imputation of missing EHR data can improve interpretation and increase our power to predict health outcomes. However, use of the most popular imputation methods mainly require scripting skills, and are implemented using various packages and syntax. Thus, the implementation of a full suite of methods is generally out of reach to all except experienced data scientists. Moreover, imputation is often considered as a separate exercise from exploratory data analysis, but should be considered as art of the data exploration process. We have created a new graphical tool, ImputEHR, that is based on a Python base and allows implementation of a range of simple and sophisticated (e.g., gradient-boosted tree-based and neural network) data imputation approaches. In addition to imputation, the tool enables data exploration for informed decision-making, as well as implementing machine learning prediction tools for response data selected by the user. Although the approach works for any missing data problem, the tool is primarily motivated by problems encountered for EHR and other biomedical data. We illustrate the tool using multiple real datasets, providing performance measures of imputation and downstream predictive analysis",ImputEHR: A Visualization Tool of Imputation for the Prediction of Biomedical Data,https://core.ac.uk/download/475059757.pdf,"[{'title': 'Frontiers in Genetics', 'identifiers': ['1664-8021', 'issn:1664-8021']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',10.3389/fgene.2021.691274,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Other sensing techniques present drawbacks such as high invasiveness and limited physical range. The present work presents a fully noninvasive system for fault detection and isolation in internal combustion engines through sound signals processing. An acquisition system was developed, whose data are transmitted to a smartphone in which the signal is processed, and the user has access to the information. A study of the chaotic behavior of the vehicle was carried out, and the feasibility of using fractal dimensions as a tool to diagnose engine misfire and problems in the alternator belt was verified. An artificial neural network was used for fault classification using the fractal dimension data extracted from the sound of the engine. For comparison purposes, a strategy based on wavelet multiresolution analysis was also implemented. The proposed solution allows a diagnosis without having any contact with the vehicle, with low computational cost, without the need for installing sensors, and in real time. The system and method were validated through experimental tests, with a success rate of 99% for the faults under consideration",Noninvasive Methods for Fault Detection and Isolation in Internal Combustion Engines Based on Chaos Analysis,,"[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",'MDPI AG',10.3390/s21206925,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Then, the time-domain features and the frequency-domain features of the denoised signal are extracted, and features of time domain and frequency domain are fused.

To accelerate embedding ML in more applications and incorporating it in real-world scenarios, automated machine learning (AutoML) is emerging. The main purpose of AutoML is to provide seamless integration of ML in various industries, which will facilitate better outcomes in everyday tasks. In healthcare, AutoML has been already applied to easier settings with structured data such as tabular lab data. However, there is still a need for applying AutoML for interpreting medical text, which is being generated at a tremendous rate. For this to happen, a promising method is AutoML for clinical notes analysis, which is an unexplored research area representing a gap in ML research. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive survey and analytical study towards AutoML for clinical notes. To that end, we first introduce the AutoML technology and review its various tools and techniques. We then survey the literature of AutoML in the healthcare industry and discuss the developments specific to clinical settings, as well as those using general AutoML tools for healthcare applications. With this background, we then discuss challenges of working with clinical notes and highlight the benefits of developing AutoML for medical notes processing. Next, we survey relevant ML research for clinical notes and analyze the literature and the field of AutoML in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, we propose future research directions and shed light on the challenges and opportunities this emerging field holds.

Recent developments in condition monitoring (CM) techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools enabled the collection of a huge amount of data in real-time and its transformation into meaningful information that will support the maintenance decision-making process. The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies connect distributed physical systems with their virtual representations in the cyber computational world. The PHM assumes a key role in the implementation of CPS in manufacturing contexts, since it allows to keep CPS and its machines in proper conditions. On the other hand, CPS-based PHM provide an efficient solution to maximize availability of machines and production systems.
In this paper, evolving and unsupervised approaches for the implementation of PHM at a component level are described, which are able to process streaming data in real-time and with almost-zero prior knowledge about the monitored component. A case study from a real industrial context is presented. Different unsupervised and online anomaly detection methods are combined with evolving clustering models in order to detect anomalous behaviors in streaming vibration data and integrate the so-generated knowledge into supervised and adaptive models; then, the degradation model for each identified fault is built and the resulting RUL prediction model integrated into the online analysis.

491003696,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Since 2017, we have used IonTorrent NGS platform in our hospital to diagnose and treat cancer. Analyzing variants at each run requires considerable time, and we are still struggling with some variants that appear correct on the metrics at first, but are found to be negative upon further investigation. Can any machine learning algorithm (ML) help us classify NGS variants? This has led us to investigate which ML can fit our NGS data and to develop a tool that can be routinely implemented to help biologists. Currently, one of the greatest challenges in medicine is processing a significant quantity of data. This is particularly true in molecular biology with the advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for profiling and identifying molecular tumors and their treatment. In addition to bioinformatics pipelines, artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable in helping to analyze mutation variants. Generating sequencing data from patient DNA samples has become easy to perform in clinical trials. However, analyzing the massive quantities of genomic or transcriptomic data and extracting the key biomarkers associated with a clinical response to a specific therapy requires a formidable combination of scientific expertise, biomolecular skills and a panel of bioinformatic and biostatistic tools, in which artificial intelligence is now successful in developing future routine diagnostics. However, cancer genome complexity and technical artifacts make identifying real variants challenging. We present a machine learning method for classifying pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs), insertions, and deletions detected by NGS from different types of tumor specimens, such as: colorectal, melanoma, lung and glioma cancer. We compared our NGS data to different machine learning algorithms using the k-fold cross-validation method and to neural networks (deep learning) to measure the performance of the different ML algorithms and determine which one is a valid model for confirming NGS variant calls in cancer diagnosis. We trained our machine learning with 70% of our data samples, extracted from our local database (our data structure had 7 parameters: chromosome, position, exon, variant allele frequency, minor allele frequency, coverage and protein description) and validated it with the 30% remaining data. The model offering the best accuracy was chosen and implemented in the NGS analysis routine. Artificial intelligence was developed with the R script language version 3.6.0. We trained our model on 70% of 102,011 variants. Our best error rate (0.22%) was found with random forest machine learning (ntree = 500 and mtry = 4), with an AUC of 0.99. Neural networks achieved some good scores. The final trained model with the neural network achieved an accuracy of 98% and an ROC-AUC of 0.99 with validation data. We tested our RF model to interpret more than 2000 variants from our NGS database: 20 variants were misclassified (error rate < 1%). The errors were nomenclature problems and false positives. After adding false positives to our training database and implementing our RF model routinely, our error rate was always < 0.5%. The RF model shows excellent results for oncosomatic NGS interpretation and can easily be implemented in other molecular biology laboratories. AI is becoming increasingly important in molecular biomedical analysis and can be very helpful in processing medical data. Neural networks show a good capacity in variant classification, and in the future, they may be useful in predicting more complex variants",Machine learning random forest for predicting oncosomatic variant NGS analysis,,"[{'title': 'Scientific Reports', 'identifiers': ['2045-2322', 'issn:2045-2322']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1038/s41598-021-01253-y,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The task is challenging owing to shortage and ineffectiveness of clinical testing kits. However, the existing problems can be improved by employing computational intelligent techniques on radiological images like CT-Scans (Computed Tomography) of lungs. Extensive research has been reported using deep learning models to diagnose the severity of COVID-19 from CT images. This has undoubtedly minimized the manual involvement in abnormality identification but reported detection accuracy is limited. Methods: The present work proposes an expert model based on deep features and Parameter Free BAT (PF-BAT) optimized Fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (PF-FKNN) classifier to diagnose novel coronavirus. In this proposed model, features are extracted from the fully connected layer of transfer learned MobileNetv2 followed by FKNN training. The hyperparameters of FKNN are fine-tuned using PF-BAT. Results: The experimental results on the benchmark COVID CT scan data reveal that the proposed algorithm attains a validation accuracy of 99.38&#x0025; which is better than the existing state-of-the-art methods proposed in past. Conclusion: The proposed model will help in timely and accurate identification of the coronavirus at the various phases.

Approaches to assess patients' fall risk have been implemented in hospitals internationally, ranging from brief screening questions to multifactorial risk assessments and complex prediction models, despite a lack of clear evidence of effect in reducing falls in acute hospital environments. The increasing digitisation of hospital systems provides new opportunities to understand and predict falls using routinely recorded data, with potential to integrate fall prediction models into real-time or near-real-time computerised decision support for clinical teams seeking to mitigate fall risk. However, the use of non-traditional approaches to fall risk prediction, including machine learning using integrated electronic medical records, has not yet been reviewed relative to more traditional fall prediction models. This scoping review will summarise methodologies used to develop existing hospital fall prediction models, including reporting quality assessment.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley framework and its recent advances, and will be reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews recommendations.

Applications in logistics or ridesharing will require a specific year of service rather than the conventional mileage usage. Reliable operations of the electronic systems must be assured at all times, regardless of the usage condition. A more dynamic and on-demand way of assuring the system availability will have to be developed. This article proposes a thermomechanical stress-based prognostics method as a potential solution. The goal is achieved by several novel advancements. On the experimental front, a key microelectronics package is developed to directly apply the prognostics and health management concept using a piezoresistive silicon-based stress sensor. Additional hardware for safe and secure data transmission and data processing is also developed, which is critically required for recording in situ and real-time data. On the data management front, proper data-driven approaches have to be identified to handle the unique dataset from the stress sensor employed in this study. The approaches effectively handle the massive amount of data that reveals the important information and automation of the prognostic process and thus to be able to detect, classify, locate, and predict the failure. The statistical techniques for diagnostics and the machine learning algorithms for health assessment and prognostics are also determined to implement the approaches in a simple, fast, but accurate way within the capacity of limited computing power.

487585666,2021-10-02T00:00:00,"International audienceBackground: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular-omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods: The European ""ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)"" consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results: This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the ""ITFoC Challenge"". This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets. Conclusions: The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized care",A framework for validating AI in precision medicine: considerations from the European ITFoC consortium,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1186/s12911-021-01634-3,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429033224,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.

479723532,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"An increase in unplanned downtime of machines disrupts and degrades the industrial business, which results in substantial credibility damage and monetary loss. The cutting tool is a critical asset of the milling machine; the failure of the cutting tool causes a loss in industrial productivity due to unplanned downtime. In such cases, a proper predictive maintenance strategy by real-time health monitoring of cutting tools becomes essential. Accurately predicting the useful life of equipment plays a vital role in the predictive maintenance arena of industry 4.0. Many active research efforts have been done to estimate tool life in varied directions. However, the consolidated study of the implemented techniques and future pathways is still missing. So, the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive literature survey on the data-driven approach of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation of cutting tools during the milling process. The authors have summarized different monitoring techniques, feature extraction methods, decision-making models, and available sensors currently used in the data-driven model. The authors have also presented publicly available datasets related to milling under various operating conditions to compare the accuracy of the prediction model for tool wear estimation. Finally, the article concluded with the challenges, limitations, recent advancements in RUL prognostics techniques using Artificial Intelligence (AI), and future research scope to explore more in this area","Data-Driven Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Milling Process: Sensors, Algorithms, Datasets, and Future Directions",,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101284,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Interest in artificial intelligence-driven analysis of medical images has seen a steep increase in recent years. Thus, our paper aims to promote and facilitate the use of this state-of-the-art technology to fellow researchers and clinicians.
New method

We present custom deep learning models generated in DeePathology™ STUDIO without the need for background knowledge in deep learning and computer science underlined by practical suggestions.
Results

We describe the general workflow in this commercially available software and present three real-world examples how to detect microglia on IBA1-stained mouse brain sections including their differences, validation results and analysis of a sample slide.
Comparison with existing methods

Deep-learning assisted analysis of histological images is faster than classical analysis methods, and offers a wide variety of detection possibilities that are not available using methods based on staining intensity.
Conclusions

Reduced researcher bias, increased speed and extended possibilities make deep-learning assisted analysis of histological images superior to traditional analysis methods for histological images",Development of deep learning models for microglia analyses in brain tissue using DeePathology™ STUDIO,,,'Elsevier BV',10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109371,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389359328,2021-01-14T00:00:00,"Cardiovascular diseases have been reported to be the leading cause of mortality across the globe. Among such diseases, Myocardial Infarction (MI), also known as “heart attack”, is of main interest among researchers, as its early diagnosis can prevent life threatening cardiac conditions and potentially save human lives. Analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG) can provide valuable diagnostic information to detect different types of cardiac arrhythmia. Real-time ECG monitoring systems with advanced machine learning methods provide information about the health status in real-time and have improved user’s experience. However, advanced machine learning methods have put a burden on portable and wearable devices due to their high computing requirements. We present an improved, less complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classifier model that identifies multiple arrhythmia types using the two-dimensional image of the ECG wave in real-time. The proposed model is presented as a three-layer ECG signal analysis model that can potentially be adopted in real-time portable and wearable monitoring devices. We have designed, implemented, and simulated the proposed CNN network using Matlab.

By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks.

Localized autonomous weedicide spray through aerial spraying units can help save water, weedicide chemical and effect less on human health. Such systems require multi-spectral cues to classify crop, weed, and soil surface. Our focus in this paper is on the detection of weeds in the sugar beet crop, using air-borne multispectral camera sensors, which is considered as an alternative crop to sugarcane to obtain sugar in Pakistan. We developed a new framework for weed identification; a patch-based classification approach as appose to semantic segmentation that is more realistic for real-time intelligent aerial spraying systems. Our approach converts 3-class pixel classification problem into a 2-class crop-weed patch classification problem which in turns improves crop and weed classification accuracy.

STARLINER aimed to characterise disease behaviour in patients with suspected ILD during the peri-diagnostic period using real-time home-based assessments. Methods: STARLINER (NCT03261037) was an international, multicentre study. Patients ≥ 50 years old with suspected ILD were followed throughout the peri-diagnostic period, consisting of a pre-diagnostic period (from enrolment to diagnosis) and a post-diagnostic period (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Study length was variable (≤ 18 months). The primary endpoint was time-adjusted semi-annual forced vital capacity (FVC) change measured during the peri-diagnostic period using daily home spirometry in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Secondary outcomes included changes in FVC (home spirometry) in patients with non-IPF ILD, changes in FVC (site spirometry), changes in physical functional capacity measured by daily home accelerometry and site 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IPF or non-IPF ILD. Results: Of the 178 patients enrolled in the study, 68 patients were diagnosed with IPF, 62 patients were diagnosed with non-IPF ILD, 9 patients received a non-ILD diagnosis and 39 patients did not receive a diagnosis. Technical and analytical issues led to problems in applying the prespecified linear regression model to analyse the home FVC data. Time-adjusted median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) semi-annual FVC change during the peri-diagnostic period measured using home and site spirometry, respectively, was – 147.7 (– 723.8, 376.2) ml and – 149.0 (– 314.6, 163.9) ml for IPF and 19.1 (– 194.9, 519.0) ml and – 23.4 (– 117.9, 133.5) ml in non-IPF ILD. A greater decline in steps per day was observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD, whereas an increase in 6MWD was observed for patients with IPF versus a decline in 6MWD for patients with non-IPF ILD. No clear patterns of disease behaviour were observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD for PROs. Conclusions: Despite home spirometry being feasible for most patients and centres, technical and analytical challenges in the home-based assessments prevented firm conclusions regarding disease behaviour. This highlights that further optimisation of the technology and analysis methods is required before widespread implementation.

New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular-omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods: The European ""ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)"" consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results: This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the ""ITFoC Challenge"". This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets. Conclusions: The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings.

Uncertainty in patients' COVID-19 status contributes to treatment delays, nosocomial transmission, and operational pressures in hospitals. However, the typical turnaround time for laboratory PCR remains 12–24 h and lateral flow devices (LFDs) have limited sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that artificial intelligence-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) can provide rapid COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1 h of arrival to hospital. Here, we aimed to improve the time from arrival to the emergency department to the availability of a result, do external and prospective validation, and deploy a novel laboratory-free screening tool in a UK emergency department.
Methods
We optimised our previous model, removing less informative predictors to improve generalisability and speed, developing the CURIAL-Lab model with vital signs and readily available blood tests (full blood count [FBC]; urea, creatinine, and electrolytes; liver function tests; and C-reactive protein) and the CURIAL-Rapide model with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were validated externally for emergency admissions to University Hospitals Birmingham, Bedfordshire Hospitals, and Portsmouth Hospitals University National Health Service (NHS) trusts, and prospectively at Oxford University Hospitals, by comparison with PCR testing. Next, we compared model performance directly against LFDs and evaluated a combined pathway that triaged patients who had either a positive CURIAL model result or a positive LFD to a COVID-19-suspected clinical area. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser to provide laboratory-free COVID-19 screening at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK). Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result, and our performance measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
Findings

CURIAL-Lab and CURIAL-Rapide performed consistently across trusts (AUROC range 0·858–0·881, 95% CI 0·838–0·912, for CURIAL-Lab and 0·836–0·854, 0·814–0·889, for CURIAL-Rapide), achieving highest sensitivity at Portsmouth Hospitals (84·1%, Wilson's 95% CI 82·5–85·7, for CURIAL-Lab and 83·5%, 81·8–85·1, for CURIAL-Rapide) at specificities of 71·3% (70·9–71·8) for CURIAL-Lab and 63·6% (63·1–64·1) for CURIAL-Rapide. When combined with LFDs, model predictions improved triage sensitivity from 56·9% (51·7–62·0) for LFDs alone to 85·6% with CURIAL-Lab (81·6–88·9; AUROC 0·925) and 88·2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84·4–91·1; AUROC 0·919), thereby reducing missed COVID-19 cases by 65% with CURIAL-Lab and 72% with CURIAL-Rapide. For the prospective deployment of CURIAL-Rapide, 520 patients were enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between Feb 18 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing and ten (2·3%) tested positive. Median time from arrival to a CURIAL-Rapide result was 45 min (IQR 32–64), 16 min (26·3%) sooner than with LFDs (61 min, 37–99; log-rank p<0·0001), and 6 h 52 min (90·2%) sooner than with PCR (7 h 37 min, 6 h 5 min to 15 h 39 min; p<0·0001). Classification performance was high, with sensitivity of 87·5% (95% CI 52·9–97·8), specificity of 85·4% (81·3–88·7), and negative predictive value of 99·7% (98·2–99·9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded infection for 31 (58·5%) of 53 patients who were triaged by a physician to a COVID-19-suspected area but went on to test negative by PCR.
Interpretation
Our findings show the generalisability, performance, and real-world operational benefits of artificial intelligence-driven screening for COVID-19 over standard-of-care in emergency departments. CURIAL-Rapide provided rapid, laboratory-free screening when used with near-patient FBC analysis, and was able to reduce the number of patients who tested negative for COVID-19 but were triaged to COVID-19-suspected areas",Real-world evaluation of AI driven COVID-19 triage for emergency admissions: External validation & operational assessment of lab-free and high-throughput screening solutions,,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
526618216,2022-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper explores the tension between finding an approach to curriculum design that best fits the needs and experiences of individual students and teachers and implementing the findings of generalised evidence-based research.Big questions about personhood and the nature of reality are intertwined with real-world problems that affect individuals, societies and global communities – such as artificial intelligence, mental and physical health, the environment, and space travel. They are also questions that bridge science, religion and the wider humanities. Equipping school students with the insight and skills they need to ask and explore Big Questions is a recognised curriculum priority nationally and internationally.

In the case study reported in this paper, teachers, researchers and senior leaders grapple with where and how to provide opportunities for a cohort of secondary school students to become ‘epistemically insightful’ – in response to research that emphasises that students should be equipped and eager to work with different types of knowledge within and across their curriculum subjects. The paper discusses the process and impact of establishing a research-led co-creation partnership designed to transform curriculum practice and policy whilst maintaining teachers’ agency within a whole school approach to curriculum transformation. Drawing on our findings we argue that “best practice” for researcher-participant relationship is one where the research actively involves the participants, as a community, rather than the research being “done on” them.

Furthermore, there is a complex balance to be struck between practitioner co-creation and maintaining the integrity, in this instance, of the findings of published research. After setting out the role of the LASAR (Learning about Science and Religion) Centre at Canterbury Christ Church University in establishing the Epistemic Insight Initiative (and the projects’ research aims), we explain how the co-creation process between university research and school practitioners has provided a context in which the key success criteria for a research-engaged school are provided by this collaboration.

Moreover, we describe and discuss the practices that enabled participating teachers to develop their epistemic agency so that they were co-creators of research within a whole school approach. Existing practitioner literature highlights the benefits of research engagement in individual schools and the importance of access to mentoring and research expertise (see Sharp et al., 2006) alongside similar guidance for the role the researcher should take in offering a ‘guiding light’. However, this places research engagement within the framework of school improvement plans over a sustained ethos. A decade later Nelson and Sharples (2017) highlight that evidence- informed practice is often divided between desk based “research” by teachers as separate from “academic research” conducted by ‘universities or professional research organisations’ a model which emphasises the teachers’ role as a consumer rather than creator of rigorous research . Indeed, McAleavy goes as far as to say even where teachers and schools are able to have “research leads” they are ‘in uncharted waters without a compass. There is no blueprint for the work of the Research Lead and the coordination of research activities in schools is not necessarily straightforward’. The process is still relatively under-discussed, although Godfrey (2016) has provided a valuable framework to developing a co-creation model (although he focuses on the creation of a research ecosystem within a school, led by the senior team). Whilst this paper focuses on work within one case study school, some of the findings relate to setting up a research ecosystem that includes a variety of schools.

The final part of this paper presents interim results from staff and student data that evidences the impact participation has had on the research ethos and learning experiences within the school. We discuss the ways in which the partnership has equipped teachers to investigate their own related practice enquiry and point towards the next steps for developing a whole school research-engaged ethos",A case study of how research co-creation is supporting the development of ‘Epistemically `Insightful’ curriculum transformation in English secondary schools,,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

442071865,2021-03-01T00:00:00,"BackgroundImmunohistochemistry (IHC) remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of pathological diseases. This technique has been supporting pathologists in making precise decisions regarding differential diagnosis and subtyping, and in creating personalized treatment plans. However, the interpretation of IHC results presents challenges in complicated cases. Furthermore, rapidly increasing amounts of IHC data are making it even harder for pathologists to reach to definitive conclusions.MethodsWe developed ImmunoGenius, a machine-learning-based expert system for the pathologist, to support the diagnosis of tumors of unknown origin. Based on Bayesian theorem, the most probable diagnoses can be drawn by calculating the probabilities of the IHC results in each disease. We prepared IHC profile data of 584 antibodies in 2009 neoplasms based on the relevant textbooks. We developed the reactive native mobile application for iOS and Android platform that can provide 10 most possible differential diagnoses based on the IHC input.ResultsWe trained the software using 562 real case data, validated it with 382 case data, tested it with 164 case data and compared the precision hit rate. Precision hit rate was 78.5, 78.0 and 89.0% in training, validation and test dataset respectively. Which showed no significant difference. The main reason for discordant precision was lack of disease-specific IHC markers and overlapping IHC profiles observed in similar diseases.ConclusionThe results of this study showed a potential that the machine-learning algorithm based expert system can support the pathologic diagnosis by providing second opinion on IHC interpretation based on IHC database. Incorporation with contextual data including the clinical and histological findings might be required to elaborate the system in the future.11Nsciescopu","Diagnosis prediction of tumours of unknown origin using ImmunoGenius, a machine learning-based expert system for immunohistochemistry profile interpretation",,"[{'title': 'Diagnostic Pathology', 'identifiers': ['1746-1596', 'issn:1746-1596']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1186/s13000-021-01081-8,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

429990396,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system. Its diagnosis nowadays commonly includes performing an MRI scan, as it is the most sensitive imaging test for MS. MS plaques are commonly identified from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images as hyperintense regions that are highly varying in terms of their shapes, sizes and locations, and are routinely classified in accordance to the McDonald criteria. Recent years have seen an increase in works that aimed at development of various semi-automatic and automatic methods for detection, segmentation and classification of MS plaques. In this paper, we present an automatic combined method, based on two pipelines: a traditional unsupervised machine learning technique and a deep-learning attention-gate 3D U-net network. The deep-learning network is specifically trained to address the weaker points of the traditional approach, namely difficulties in segmenting infratentorial and juxtacortical plaques in real-world clinical MRIs. It was trained and validated on a multi-center multi-scanner dataset that contains 159 cases, each with T1 weighted (T1w) and FLAIR images, as well as manual delineations of the MS plaques, segmented and validated by a panel of raters. The detection rate was quantified using lesion-wise Dice score. A simple label fusion is implemented to combine the output segmentations of the two pipelines. This combined method improves the detection of infratentorial and juxtacortical lesions by 14% and 31% respectively, in comparison to the unsupervised machine learning pipeline that was used as a performance assessment baseline",icobrain ms 5.1: Combining unsupervised and supervised approaches for improving the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions,,"[{'title': 'NeuroImage Clinical', 'identifiers': ['2213-1582', 'issn:2213-1582']}]",'Elsevier BV',10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102707,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Is this transformation a blessing or a curse for psychiatry? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and eHealth services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that eHealth services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor–patient relationships.

480137986,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness, characterized by the loss of the notion of reality, failing to distinguish it from the imaginary. It affects the patient in life’s major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, and the usual treatment is performed with the help of anti-psychotic medication, which targets primarily the hallucinations, delirium, etc. Other symptoms, such as the decreased emotional expression or avolition, require a multidisciplinary approach, including psychopharmacology, cognitive training, and many forms of therapy. In this context, this paper addresses the use of digital technologies to design and develop innovative rehabilitation techniques, particularly focusing on mental health rehabilitation, and contributing for the promotion of well-being and health from a holistic perspective. In this context, serious games and virtual reality allows for creation of immersive environments that contribute to a more effective and lasting recovery, with improvements in terms of quality of life. The use of machine learning techniques will allow the real-time analysis of the data collected during the execution of the rehabilitation procedures, as well as enable their dynamic and automatic adaptation according to the profile and performance of the patients, by increasing or reducing the exercises’ difficulty. It relies on the acquisition of biometric and physiological signals, such as voice, heart rate, and game performance, to estimate the stress level, thus adapting the difficulty of the experience to the skills of the patient. The system described in this paper is currently in development, in collaboration with a health unit, and is an engineering effort that combines hardware and software to develop a rehabilitation tool for schizophrenic patients.

487594732,2021-10-02T00:00:00,"International audienceBackground: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular-omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods: The European ""ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)"" consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results: This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the ""ITFoC Challenge"". This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets. Conclusions: The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized care",A framework for validating AI in precision medicine: considerations from the European ITFoC consortium,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1186/s12911-021-01634-3,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The development of easy-to-measure competence standards for optical diagnosis can optimize clinical decision-making in endoscopy. This manuscript represents an official Position Statement of the ESGE aiming to define simple, safe, and easy-to-measure competence standards for endoscopists and artificial intelligence systems performing optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps (1 - 5 mm). METHODS : A panel of European experts in optical diagnosis participated in a modified Delphi process to reach consensus on Simple Optical Diagnosis Accuracy (SODA) competence standards for implementation of the optical diagnosis strategy for diminutive colorectal polyps. In order to assess the clinical benefits and harms of implementing optical diagnosis with different competence standards, a systematic literature search was performed. This was complemented with the results from a recently performed simulation study that provides guidance for setting alternative competence standards for optical diagnosis. Proposed competence standards were based on literature search and simulation study results. Competence standards were accepted if at least 80 % agreement was reached after a maximum of three voting rounds. RECOMMENDATION 1:  In order to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive colorectal lesions (1-5 mm), it is clinically acceptable if, during real-time colonoscopy, at least 90 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity is achieved for high confidence endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia of 1-5 mm in the rectosigmoid.

481121923,2021-12-01T00:00:00,"International audienceSince 2017, we have used IonTorrent NGS platform in our hospital to diagnose and treat cancer. Analyzing variants at each run requires considerable time, and we are still struggling with some variants that appear correct on the metrics at first, but are found to be negative upon further investigation. Can any machine learning algorithm (ML) help us classify NGS variants? This has led us to investigate which ML can fit our NGS data and to develop a tool that can be routinely implemented to help biologists. Currently, one of the greatest challenges in medicine is processing a significant quantity of data. This is particularly true in molecular biology with the advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for profiling and identifying molecular tumors and their treatment. In addition to bioinformatics pipelines, artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable in helping to analyze mutation variants. Generating sequencing data from patient DNA samples has become easy to perform in clinical trials. However, analyzing the massive quantities of genomic or transcriptomic data and extracting the key biomarkers associated with a clinical response to a specific therapy requires a formidable combination of scientific expertise, biomolecular skills and a panel of bioinformatic and biostatistic tools, in which artificial intelligence is now successful in developing future routine diagnostics. However, cancer genome complexity and technical artifacts make identifying real variants challenging. We present a machine learning method for classifying pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs), insertions, and deletions detected by NGS from different types of tumor specimens, such as: colorectal, melanoma, lung and glioma cancer. We compared our NGS data to different machine learning algorithms using the k-fold cross-validation method and to neural networks (deep learning) to measure the performance of the different ML algorithms and determine which one is a valid model for confirming NGS variant calls in cancer diagnosis. We trained our machine learning with 70% of our data samples, extracted from our local database (our data structure had 7 parameters: chromosome, position, exon, variant allele frequency, minor allele frequency, coverage and protein description) and validated it with the 30% remaining data. The model offering the best accuracy was chosen and implemented in the NGS analysis routine. Artificial intelligence was developed with the R script language version 3.6.0. We trained our model on 70% of 102,011 variants. Our best error rate (0.22%) was found with random forest machine learning (ntree = 500 and mtry = 4), with an AUC of 0.99. Neural networks achieved some good scores. The final trained model with the neural network achieved an accuracy of 98% and an ROC-AUC of 0.99 with validation data. We tested our RF model to interpret more than 2000 variants from our NGS database: 20 variants were misclassified (error rate < 1%). The errors were nomenclature problems and false positives. After adding false positives to our training database and implementing our RF model routinely, our error rate was always < 0.5%. The RF model shows excellent results for oncosomatic NGS interpretation and can easily be implemented in other molecular biology laboratories. AI is becoming increasingly important in molecular biomedical analysis and can be very helpful in processing medical data. Neural networks show a good capacity in variant classification, and in the future, they may be useful in predicting more complex variants",Machine learning random forest for predicting oncosomatic variant NGS analysis,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1038/s41598-021-01253-y,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Their goal is to improve health and well-being in the workplace, and to this end, the task is to identify groups of employees at risk of sickness absence who can then be targeted with interventions aiming to reduce or prevent absences. To facilitate deployment, we apply a range of existing machine-learning methods to obtain predictions at monthly intervals using real HR and payroll data that contains no health-related predictors. We model employee absence as a binary classification problem with loss asymmetry and conceptualise a misclassification cost matrix of employee sickness absence. Model performance is evaluated using cost-based metrics, which have intuitive interpretation. We also demonstrate how this problem can be approached when costs are unknown. The proposed flexible evaluation procedure is not restricted to a specific model or domain and can be applied to address other HR analytics questions when deployed.

490909377,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: One of the common limitations in the treatment of cancer is in the early detection of this disease. The customary medical practice of cancer examination is a visual examination by the dermatologist followed by an invasive biopsy. Nonetheless, this symptomatic approach is time-consuming and prone to human errors. An automated machine learning model is essential to capacitate fast diagnoses and early treatment. Objective: The key objective of this study is to establish a fully automatic model that helps Dermatologists in skin cancer handling process in a way that could improve skin lesion classification accuracy. Method: The work is conducted following an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using the Python-based deep learning library Keras. We incorporated effective image filtering and enhancement algorithms such as bilateral filter to enhance feature detection and extraction during training. The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) needed slightly more fine-tuning to ripe a better return. Hyperparameter optimization was utilized for selecting the best-performed hyperparameter combinations and several network hyperparameters. In this work, we decreased the learning rate from the default 0.001 to 0.0002, and the momentum for Adam optimization algorithm from 0.9 to 0.5, in trying to reduce the instability issues related to GAN models and at each iteration the weights of the discriminative and generative network were updated to balance the loss between them. We endeavour to address a binary classification which predicts two classes present in our dataset, namely benign and malignant. More so, some well-known metrics such as the receiver operating characteristic -area under the curve and confusion matrix were incorporated for evaluating the results and classification accuracy. Results: The model generated very conceivable lesions during the early stages of the experiment and we could easily visualise a smooth transition in resolution along the way. Thus, we have achieved an overall test accuracy of 93.5% after fine-tuning most parameters of our network. Conclusion: This classification model provides spatial intelligence that could be useful in the future for cancer risk prediction. Unfortunately, it is difficult to generate high quality images that are much like the synthetic real samples and to compare different classification methods given the fact that some methods use non-public datasets for training",Generative adversarial network image synthesis method for skin lesion generation and classification,,"[{'title': 'Journal of Medical Signals & Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:2228-7477', '2228-7477']}]",'Medknow',10.4103/jmss.JMSS_53_20,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491102519,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Paper-based biosensors based on lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) are promising candidates for POC diagnosis because of their ease of use and rapid target detection. However, the low sensitivity of LFI limits its application, and signal amplification has been used in numerous studies to increase its sensitivity. We developed an advanced trap LFI (α-trapLFI), a simple-to-use sensor, with an additional step for signal amplification. Here, signal amplification is automatically implemented following delayed release of enhancement solution induced by water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol tape. As the polyvinyl alcohol tape is exposed to water, its polymer structure is perturbed (within 5 min), allowing ions to pass through. This new sensor was designed to have a short time delay between the flow of solutions used for the immunoassay and signal amplification. The α-trapLFI was subsequently used to detect cortisol with high sensitivity (9.1 pg∙mL−1) over a broad detection range (0.01–1000 ng∙mL−1) in bodily fluids.

However, AF is often asymptomatic, and frequently remains undiagnosed until complications occur. Current screening approaches for AF lack either cost-effectiveness or diagnostic sensitivity; thus, there is interest in tools that could be used for population screening. An AF risk prediction algorithm, developed using machine learning from a UK dataset of 2,994,837 patients, was found to be more effective than existing models at identifying patients at risk of AF. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of this risk prediction algorithm combined with diagnostic testing for the identification of AF in a real-world primary care setting. Eligible participants (aged &#x2265;30&#xA0;years and without an existing AF diagnosis) registered at participating UK general practices will be randomised into intervention and control arms. Intervention arm participants identified at highest risk of developing AF (algorithm risk score&#xA0;&#x2265;&#xA0;7.4%) will be invited for a 12&#x2011;lead electrocardiogram (ECG) followed by two-weeks of home-based ECG monitoring with a KardiaMobile device. Control arm participants will be used for comparison and will be managed routinely. The primary outcome is the number of AF diagnoses in the intervention arm compared with the control arm during the research window. If the trial is successful, there is potential for the risk prediction algorithm to be implemented throughout primary care for narrowing the population considered at highest risk for AF who could benefit from more intensive screening for AF.

491498748,2022-01-01T00:00:00,"The proper inspection of a cracks pattern over time is a critical diagnosis step to provide a thorough knowledge of the health state of a structure. When monitoring cracks propagating on a planar surface, adopting a single-image-based approach is a more convenient (costly and logistically) solution compared to subjective operators-based solutions. Machine learning (ML)- based monitoring solutions offer the advantage of automation in crack detection; however, complex and time-consuming training must be carried out. This study presents a simple and automated ML-based crack monitoring approach implemented in open sources software that only requires a single image for training. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed conducting work in controlled and real case study sites. For both sites, the generated outputs are significant in terms of accuracy (~1 mm), repeatability (sub-mm) and precision (sub-pixel). The presented results highlight that the successful detection of cracks is achievable with only a straightforward ML-based training procedure conducted on only a single image of the multi-temporal sequence.

One of the main issues that arise in IOMT is how securely the data can be transmitted to the clinical team. In this project, biometric Identity-based encryption was utilized using the Fuzzy-IBE (Identity-based encryption) scheme that uses face features of the clinicians to create the public key. Figure 1 shows the testbed setup designed to improve the privacy and security of the patients' healthcare data. Methods: The testbed comprises an ESP32 platform sensing and encrypting data, the Nvidia Jetson Nano for data collection and decryption, and the Thingsboard online platform for vital information visualization. Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption (FIBE) 1-3 uses legitimate users' facial features. The encrypted vital information is transmitted to the Edge-device (Jetson Nano) through BLE/Wi-Fi. On the edge-device of the healthcare system, the face authentication mechanism verifies the user's (clinician) legitimacy to assess the data. Upon user authentication, their facial features will be used to generate a private decryption key that can decrypt the received encrypted data. The data is further sent to the core cloud (Thingsboard) for storage and visualization. To secure the data on the cloud, we deployed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) model using deep learning to identify the inter-domain stream of malicious traffic. Results: The face authentication testing using Fuzzy Identity-based Cryptography relied on a public data set. The execution time was calculated for Encryption (time to encrypt the patient's vital data using a public key of health physician's facial features) and decryption (time to match at least d components of the ciphertext and perform message decryption). The experimental results are reported in Table 1. Conclusion: In today's age of advanced telecommunication technology, cyber security is a very important factor.

511382804,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples.

The development of easy-to-measure competence standards for optical diagnosis can optimize clinical decision-making in endoscopy. This manuscript represents an official Position Statement of the ESGE aiming to define simple, safe, and easy-to-measure competence standards for endoscopists and artificial intelligence systems performing optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps (1 - 5 mm). METHODS : A panel of European experts in optical diagnosis participated in a modified Delphi process to reach consensus on Simple Optical Diagnosis Accuracy (SODA) competence standards for implementation of the optical diagnosis strategy for diminutive colorectal polyps. In order to assess the clinical benefits and harms of implementing optical diagnosis with different competence standards, a systematic literature search was performed. This was complemented with the results from a recently performed simulation study that provides guidance for setting alternative competence standards for optical diagnosis. Proposed competence standards were based on literature search and simulation study results. Competence standards were accepted if at least 80 % agreement was reached after a maximum of three voting rounds. RECOMMENDATION 1:  In order to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive colorectal lesions (1-5 mm), it is clinically acceptable if, during real-time colonoscopy, at least 90 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity is achieved for high confidence endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia of 1-5 mm in the rectosigmoid.

The things can sense information around them, communicate the sensed information over some protocol and employ the information to solve real-life problems. In IoT, several technologies are integrated under a common umbrella so that they can connect and exchange data over a network protocol. A huge amount of data is generated from diverse geographical locations with the consequent urge for fast aggregation of overall sensed information, leading to an increase in the need to store and process such data in a more efficient and effective manner. The traditional fields of embedded systems, WSN, real-time analytics, automation system, machine learning and others all contribute to enabling the IoT.

395143647,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Although knowledge of the microstructure of food of vegetal origin helps us to understand the behavior of food materials, the variability in the microstructural elements complicates this analysis. In this regard, the construction of learning models that represent the actual microstructures of the tissue is important to extract relevant information and advance in the comprehension of such behavior. Consequently, the objective of this research is to compare two machine learning techniques¿Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN)¿when used to enhance its microstructural analysis. Two main contributions can be highlighted from this research. First, a method is proposed to automatically analyze the microstructural elements of vegetal tissue; and second, a comparison was conducted to select a classifier to discriminate between tissue structures. For the comparison, a database of microstructural elements images was obtained from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) micrographs. Two classifiers were implemented using CNN and RBNN, and statistical performance metrics were computed using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. This process was repeated one hundred times with a random selection of images in each repetition. The comparison showed that the classifiers based on CNN produced a better fit, obtaining F1¿score average of 89.42% in front of 83.83% for RBNN. In this study, the performance of classifiers based on CNN was significantly higher compared to those based on RBNN in the discrimination of microstructural elements of vegetable foods.Oblitas, J.; Mejía, J.; De-La-Torre, M.; Avila-George, H.; Seguí Gil, L.; Mayor López, L.; Ibarz, A....

427170237,2021-04-15T00:00:00,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common cause of death and disability. However, existing tools for TBI diagnosis are either subjective or require extensive clinical setup and expertise. The increasing affordability and reduction in the size of relatively high-performance computing systems combined with promising results from TBI related machine learning research make it possible to create compact and portable systems for early detection of TBI. This work describes a Raspberry Pi based portable, real-time data acquisition, and automated processing system that uses machine learning to efficiently identify TBI and automatically score sleep stages from a single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. We discuss the design, implementation, and verification of the system that can digitize the EEG signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and perform real-time signal classification to detect the presence of mild TBI (mTBI). We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost based predictive models to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the versatility of the system to operate with multiple types of predictive models. We achieve a peak classification accuracy of more than 90% with a classification time of less than 1 s across 16-64 s epochs for TBI vs. control conditions. This work can enable the development of systems suitable for field use without requiring specialized medical equipment for early TBI detection applications and TBI research.

480202172,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the most potent toxins, which are produced by Clostridium bacteria and cause the life-threatening disease of botulism in all vertebrates. Specifically, animal botulism represents a serious environmental and economic concern in animal production due to the high mortality rates observed during outbreaks. Despite the availability of vaccines against BoNT, there are still many outbreaks of botulism worldwide. Alternative assays capable of replacing the conventional in vivo assay in terms of rapid and sensitive quantification, and the applicability for on-site analysis, have long been perused. Herein, we present a simple, highly sensitive and label-free optical biosensor for real-time detection of BoNT serotype C using a porous silicon Fabry–Pérot interferometer. A competitive immunoassay coupled to a biochemical cascade reaction was adapted for optical signal amplification. The resulting insoluble precipitates accumulated within the nanostructure changed the reflectivity spectra by alternating the averaged refractive index. The augmented optical performance allowed for a linear response within the range of 10 to 10,000 pg mL−1 while presenting a detection limit of 4.8 pg mL−1. The practical aspect of the developed assay was verified using field BoNT holotoxins to exemplify the potential use of the developed optical approach for rapid bio-diagnosis of BoNT. The specificity and selectivity of the assay were successfully validated using an adjacent holotoxin relevant for farm animals (BoNT serotype D). Overall, this work sets the foundation for implementing a miniaturized interferometer for routine on-site botulism diagnosis, thus significantly reducing the need for animal experimentation and shortening analysis turnaround for early evidence-based therapy",Botulinum Neurotoxin-C Detection Using Nanostructured Porous Silicon Interferometer,,"[{'title': 'Chemosensors', 'identifiers': ['2227-9040', 'issn:2227-9040']}]",'MDPI AG',10.3390/chemosensors9080228,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490584732,2021-12-21T00:00:00,"The discipline of remote working has been characterized from the beginning by a significant participatory presence in collective bargaining, from the European Framework Agreement on Telework of 2002, to its national implementation within the Interconfederal Agreement of 2004, passing through the propulsive role that the bargaining, especially that within the company realities, had regarding the preparatory work that led to the enactment of the law 22 May 2017, n. 81 about the “smart working”. This role could also affect the reform of the discipline, made indispensable because the wide appeal that the agile type, also known as «smart working» anglicism, has had due to the spread of SARS-CoV-19. It is precisely the experimentation throughout the national territory that has rekindled the debate on the subject and stimulated bargaining again with the aim of regulating a «method of execution of the employment relationship» (Article 18, l. 81/2017) which seems to have become an integral part of the current and future organization of work. This contribution aims to investigate the first solutions born in corporate bargaining. The fil rouge that binds the 25 company agreements – selected for the innovativeness of the solutions adopted, for the completeness of the discipline or for the occupational relevance – is the intent to regulate, considering the peculiarities of the workers in force in the individual companies, not simplified smart working, and that is the one that should be resorted when the health emergency will be over – indeed already practiced by someone. Three topical study topics for post-emergency labour law have been identified: access to agile mode, workplace safety and working time flexibility. With respect to the first profile, corporate collective bargaining has expanded the number of workers with priority access to this remote working method, recognizing real rights to smart working in favour of some categories. With respect to the second profile, the agreements have more or less strictly limited the freedom of the agile worker to choose the workplace independently, also with the aim of limiting the employer’s responsibility for health and safety in the workplace, the perimeter of which does not appear sufficiently clear in line with the doctrinal debate on the subject. With respect to the third profile, the contractual practice examined has kept normal working time firm, while variously developing the possibility of placing it flexibly within the working day, abdicating instead the task of fully defining the right to disconnect and, therefore, suitable and mandatory «technical and organizational measures».La disciplina de los casos de teletrabajo se ha caracterizado desde el principio por una importante presencia participativa en la negociación colectiva, desde el Acuerdo Marco Europeo sobre Teletrabajo de 2002, hasta su implementación nacional dentro del Acuerdo Interconfederal de 2004, pasando por el papel propulsor que la negociación, especialmente que dentro de las realidades de la empresa, con respecto al trabajo preparatorio que condujo a la promulgación de la ley 22 de mayo de 2017 n. 81 sobre el trabajo ágil y que también podría afectar la reforma de la disciplina, indispensable a raíz del amplio atractivo que ha tenido el tipo ágil, también conocido con el anglicismo «smart working», debido a la propagación del SARS-CoV-19. Es precisamente la experimentación que tuvo lugar en todo el territorio nacional la que ha reavivado el debate sobre el tema y ha estimulado nuevamente la negociación con el objetivo de regular un «método de ejecución de la relación laboral» (artículo 18 de la l. 81/2017), que parece haberse convertido en parte integrante de la organización del trabajo actual y futura. Esta contribución tiene como objetivo investigar las primeras soluciones nacidas de la negociación de proximidad. El fil rouge que une los 25 convenios de empresa - seleccionados por la innovación de las soluciones adoptadas, por la integridad de la disciplina o por la relevancia ocupacional - es la intención de regular, considerando las peculiaridades de los trabajadores vigentes en las empresas individuales, el smart working no simplificado, y que es lo que se utilizará cuando la emergencia sanitaria haya pasada - de hecho ya lo practican algunos. Se han identificado tres temas de estudio de actualidad para la legislación laboral posterior a emergencias: acceso al modo ágil, seguridad en el lugar de trabajo y flexibilidad horaria. En comparación con el primer perfil, la negociación colectiva corporativa ha ampliado el número de trabajadores con acceso prioritario a este método de trabajo a distancia, reconociendo derechos reales al trabajo inteligente a favor de algunas categorías. Con respecto al segundo perfil, los acuerdos han limitado más o menos estrictamente la libertad del trabajador ágil para elegir el lugar de trabajo, también con el objetivo de limitar la responsabilidad del empleador en la salud y seguridad en el lugar de trabajo, que no parece suficientemente claro en consonancia con el debate doctrinal sobre el tema. En comparación con el tercer perfil, la práctica contractual examinada ha mantenido firme el horario normal, al tiempo que desarrolló de diversas maneras la posibilidad de ubicarlo en manera flexible dentro de la jornada laboral, abdicando en cambio de la tarea de definir plenamente el derecho a desconectarse y, por lo tanto, la idoneidad y obligatoriedad de «técnicas y medidas organizativas»La disciplina delle fattispecie di lavoro da remoto è stata sin ab origine contraddistinta da una significativa presenza partecipativa della contrattazione collettiva, dall’Accordo Quadro Europeo sul Telelavoro del 2002, al suo recepimento nazionale all’interno dell’Accordo Interconfederale del 2004, passando per il ruolo propulsivo che la contrattazione, specie quella in seno alle realtà aziendali, ha avuto rispetto ai lavori preparatori che hanno condotto all’emanazione della legge 22 maggio 2017 n. 81 sul lavoro agile e che potrebbe altresì influire sulla riforma della disciplina, resa indispensabile a seguito dell’ampio ricorso che la fattispecie agile, nota anche con l’anglicismo «smart working», ha avuto a causa della diffusione del SARS-CoV-19.
È proprio la sperimentazione avutasi sull’intero territorio nazionale che ha riacceso il dibattito in materia e stimolato nuovamente la contrattazione con l’intento di regolare una «modalità di esecuzione del rapporto di lavoro subordinato» (art. 18 l. n. 81/2017), che pare sia divenuta parte integrante dell’attuale e futura organizzazione del lavoro. Il presente contributo si propone di indagare le prime soluzioni nate in seno alla contrattazione aziendale. Il fil rouge che lega i 25 accordi aziendali – selezionati per l’innovatività delle soluzioni adottate, per la completezza della disciplina o per la rilevanza occupazionale – è l’intento di regolare, considerando le peculiarità dei lavoratori in forza nelle singole realtà aziendali, lo smart working non semplificato, e cioè quello a cui si dovrebbe ricorrere ad emergenza sanitaria conclusa – invero già da alcuni praticato.
Sono stati enucleati tre temi di studio di attualità per il diritto del lavoro post-emergenziale: l’accesso alla modalità agile, la sicurezza sul luogo di lavoro e la flessibilità oraria. Rispetto al primo profilo, la contrattazione collettiva aziendale ha ampliato la platea dei lavoratori aventi accesso prioritario a tale modalità di lavoro da remoto, riconoscendo in favore di alcune categorie veri e propri diritti allo smart working. Rispetto al secondo profilo, gli accordi hanno circoscritto in maniera più o meno stringente la libertà del lavoratore agile di scegliere autonomamente il luogo di lavoro, anche con l’intento di limitare la responsabilità del datore di lavoro in materia di salute e sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro, il cui perimetro non appare sufficientemente chiaro in linea con il dibattito dottrinale in materia. Rispetto al terzo profilo, la prassi contrattuale esaminata ha mantenuto fermo l’orario normale, pur sviluppando variamente la possibilità di collocarlo in maniera flessibile all’interno della giornata lavorativa, abdicando invece al compito di definire compiutamente il diritto alla disconnessione e, dunque, «misure tecniche e organizzative» idonee e cogenti",La contrattazione collettiva e i nodi irrisolti in materia di lavoro agile,,,Dipartimento di Scienze Giuridiche.

Learn from the advantages and disadvantages of the thermodynamic model based and data-driven artificial intelligence based gas-path diagnosis methods, a newfangled gas turbine gas-path diagnosis approach on the basis of knowledge data-driven artificial intelligence is proposed. That is a hybrid method of deep learning and gas path analysis. First, gas turbine thermodynamic model of the object to be diagnosed is constructed by adaptation modeling strategy. And the engine thermodynamic model is taken as the basal model to simulate various gas path faults. Secondly, a large number of knowledge data corresponding to component health parameters and gas turbine boundary condition parameters &#x0026; gas-path measurable parameters are simulated by setting different component health parameter values and different boundary conditions based on this basal model. And next, define the vector composed of the boundary condition parameters &#x0026; the gas path measurable parameters in the knowledge database as the input vector, and the component health parameter vector as the output vector, and a deep learning model for regression modeling of this knowledge database is designed. At last, along with the gas turbine engine runs, the trained model outputs component health parameters in real time after trained deep learning model is deployed to the corresponding gas turbine power plant. The simulation experiment results show that, accurate and quantified health parameters of each gas path component can be obtained by the proposed method in this paper, and the overall root mean square error does not exceed 0.033&#x0025;, and the maximum relative error does not exceed 0.36&#x0025;, which illustrates the proposed method has great application potential",Gas Path Fault Diagnosis of Gas Turbine Engine Based on Knowledge Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence Algorithm,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101647,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Its features and functionalities were designed by therapists, implementing AI algorithms to process information and make decisions in real-time to help children to be focused on their homework. This RA interacts with smart objects deployed at home, which are associated with the activity under observation (desk and chair). This solution allows therapists to receive more accurate information about the homework sessions inside the home. At the same time, remote interaction with the child is made possible (through the RA) to provide new instructions and support him/her along with the sessions. This RA is a significant evolution of an earlier version. All the improvements brought to the project by the modifications in technical and qualitative features are explained. Furthermore, the experiment and its results are presented to illustrate the clinical potential. This project shows that the RA can not only make observations with a high degree of precision like an expert (teacher/therapist) but also positively influences the homework performance of children with and without ADHD",Assessment of a Robotic Assistant for Supporting Homework Activities of Children With ADHD,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093233,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables timely treatment and the implementation of public health measures. We validated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, and robustness of the RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection and compared its performance with that of several EUA-approved kits. Our RT-qPCR assay was highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by not amplifying 13 other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. The assay showed high linearity using a viral isolate from a patient with known COVID-19 as well as plasmids containing target SARS-CoV-2 genes as templates. The assay showed good repeatability and reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of 3%, and a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection of 1 PFU/mL. The RT-qPCR-based assay is highly effective and can facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 without the use of EUA-approved kits or reagents in the Republic of Korea",Validation of real-time RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea,,"[{'title': 'Scientific Reports', 'identifiers': ['2045-2322', 'issn:2045-2322']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1038/s41598-021-94196-3,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
493124263,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] This paper introduces an open-source platform to support serverless computing for scientific data-processing workflow-based applications across the Cloud continuum (i.e. simultaneously involving both on-premises and public Cloud platforms to process data captured at the edge). This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.The authors would like to thank the European Union for the project ""Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum"" (AI-SPRINT), with code 101016577, funded under the H2020 Framework Programme and also the regional government of the Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) for the project IDIFEDER/2018/032 (High-Performance Algorithms for the Modeling, Simulation and early Detection of diseases in Personalized Medicine), co-funded by the European Union ERDF funds (European Regional Development Fund) of the Comunitat Valenciana 2014-2020.Risco, S.; Moltó, G.; Naranjo-Delgado, DM.; Blanquer Espert, I.

481416303,2021-10-20T00:00:00,"Background: One of the common limitations in the treatment of cancer is in the early detection of this disease. The customary medical practice of cancer examination is a visual examination by the dermatologist followed by an invasive biopsy. Nonetheless, this symptomatic approach is time-consuming and prone to human errors. An automated machine learning model is essential to capacitate fast diagnoses and early treatment. Objective: The key objective of this study is to establish a fully automatic model that helps Dermatologists in skin cancer handling process in a way that could improve skin lesion classification accuracy. Method: The work is conducted following an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using the Python-based deep learning library Keras. We incorporated effective image filtering and enhancement algorithms such as bilateral filter to enhance feature detection and extraction during training. The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) needed slightly more fine-tuning to ripe a better return. Hyperparameter optimization was utilized for selecting the best-performed hyperparameter combinations and several network hyperparameters. In this work, we decreased the learning rate from the default 0.001 to 0.0002, and the momentum for Adam optimization algorithm from 0.9 to 0.5, in trying to reduce the instability issues related to GAN models and at each iteration the weights of the discriminative and generative network were updated to balance the loss between them. We endeavour to address a binary classification which predicts two classes present in our dataset, namely benign and malignant. More so, some well-known metrics such as the receiver operating characteristic -area under the curve and confusion matrix were incorporated for evaluating the results and classification accuracy. Results: The model generated very conceivable lesions during the early stages of the experiment and we could easily visualise a smooth transition in resolution along the way. Thus, we have achieved an overall test accuracy of 93.5% after fine-tuning most parameters of our network. Conclusion: This classification model provides spatial intelligence that could be useful in the future for cancer risk prediction. Unfortunately, it is difficult to generate high quality images that are much like the synthetic real samples and to compare different classification methods given the fact that some methods use non-public datasets for training",Generative adversarial network image synthesis method for skin lesion generation and classification,https://core.ac.uk/download/481416303.pdf,"[{'title': 'Journal of Medical Signals & Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:2228-7477', '2228-7477']}]",'Medknow',10.4103/jmss.JMSS_53_20.,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490938445,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Among various medical imaging tools, chest radiographs are the most important and widely used diagnostic tool for the detection of thoracic pathologies. Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87&#x0025; for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21&#x0025; for localization of pneumothorax. Thus, the outstanding abilities of deep learning techniques can be deployed for developing robust models for pneumothorax detection",Automatic Diagnosis of Pneumothorax From Chest Radiographs: A Systematic Literature Review,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122998,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491003984,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Background The aim of the present paper is to construct an emulator of a complex biological system simulator using a machine learning approach. More specifically, the simulator is a patient-specific model that integrates metabolic, nutritional, and lifestyle data to predict the metabolic and inflammatory processes underlying the development of type-2 diabetes in absence of familiarity. Given the very high incidence of type-2 diabetes, the implementation of this predictive model on mobile devices could provide a useful instrument to assess the risk of the disease for aware individuals. The high computational cost of the developed model, being a mixture of agent-based and ordinary differential equations and providing a dynamic multivariate output, makes the simulator executable only on powerful workstations but not on mobile devices. Hence the need to implement an emulator with a reduced computational cost that can be executed on mobile devices to provide real-time self-monitoring. Results Similarly to our previous work, we propose an emulator based on a machine learning algorithm but here we consider a different approach which turn out to have better performances, indeed in terms of root mean square error we have an improvement of two order magnitude. We tested the proposed emulator on samples containing different number of simulated trajectories, and it turned out that the fitted trajectories are able to predict with high accuracy the entire dynamics of the simulator output variables. We apply the emulator to control the level of inflammation while leveraging on the nutritional input. Conclusion The proposed emulator can be implemented and executed on mobile health devices to perform quick-and-easy self-monitoring assessments",Emulating complex simulations by machine learning methods,,"[{'title': 'BMC Bioinformatics', 'identifiers': ['1471-2105', 'issn:1471-2105']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',10.1186/s12859-021-04354-7,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491037081,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Since consuming gutter oil does great harm to people’s health, the Food Safety Administration has always been seeking for a more effective and timely supervision. As laboratory tests consume much time, and existing field tests have excessive limitations, a more comprehensive method is in great need. This is the first time a study proposes machine learning algorithms for real-time gutter oil detection under multiple feature dimensions. Moreover, it is deployed on FPGA to be low-power and portable for actual use. Firstly, a variety of oil samples are generated by simulating the real detection environment. Next, based on previous studies, sensors are used to collect significant features that help distinguish gutter oil. Then, the acquired features are filtered and compared using a variety of classifiers.

can verify a user contactlessly using ‘authentication code’. The ‘authentication code’ is an ‘n’ digit
numeric code and the digits are hand gestures of sign language digits. We propose a memory-efficient
deep learning model to classify the hand gestures of the sign language digits. The proposed deep
learning model is based on the bottleneck module which is inspired by the deep residual networks.
The model achieves classification accuracy of 99.1% on the publicly available sign language digits
dataset. The model is deployed on a Raspberry pi 4 Model B edge computing system to serve as an
edge device for user verification. The edge computing system consists of two steps, it first takes input
from the camera attached to it in real-time and stores it in the buffer. In the second step, the model
classifies the digit with the inference rate of 280 ms, by taking the first image in the buffer as input.publishedVersio",Design and Implementation of Deep Learning Based Contactless Authentication System Using Hand Gestures,https://core.ac.uk/download/523305217.pdf,,'MDPI AG',10.3390/electronics10020182,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
475070866,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Multi-class classification is one of the major challenges in machine learning and an ongoing research issue. Classification algorithms are generally binary, but they must be extended to multi-class problems for real-world application. Multi-class classification is more complex than binary classification. In binary classification, only the decision boundaries of one class are to be known, whereas in multiclass classification, several boundaries are involved. The objective of this investigation is to propose a metaheuristic, optimized, multi-level classification learning system for forecasting in civil and construction engineering. The proposed system integrates the firefly algorithm (FA), metaheuristic intelligence, decomposition approaches, the one-against-one (OAO) method, and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). The enhanced FA automatically fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the LSSVM to construct an optimized LSSVM classification model. Ten benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of the enhanced optimization algorithm. Two binary-class datasets related to geotechnical engineering, concerning seismic bumps and soil liquefaction, are then used to clarify the application of the proposed system to binary problems. Further, this investigation uses multi-class cases in civil engineering and construction management to verify the effectiveness of the model in the diagnosis of faults in steel plates, quality of water in a reservoir, and determining urban land cover. The results reveal that the system predicts faults in steel plates with an accuracy of 91.085%, the quality of water in a reservoir with an accuracy of 93.650%, and urban land cover with an accuracy of 87.274%. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, its predictive accuracy is compared with that of a non-optimized baseline model, single multi-class classification algorithms (sequential minimal optimization (SMO), the Multiclass Classifier, the Naïve Bayes, the library support vector machine (LibSVM) and logistic regression) and prior studies.

Dogs can scent-identify the unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during infection by interrogating specimens or, ideally, the body of a patient. After training 6 dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 by scent in human respiratory secretions (in vitro diagnosis), we retrained 5 of them to search and find the infection by scenting the patient directly (in vivo screening). Then, efficacy trials were designed to compare the diagnostic performance of the dogs against that of the rRT-PCR in 848 human subjects: 269 hospitalized patients (COVID-19 prevalence 30.1%), 259 hospital staff (prevalence 2.7%), and 320 government employees (prevalence 1.25%). The limit of detection in vitro was lower than 10-12 copies ssRNA/mL. During in vivo efficacy experiments, our 5 dogs detected 92 COVID-19 positive patients among the 848 study subjects. The alert (lying down) was immediate, with 95.2% accuracy and high sensitivity (95.9%; 95% C.I. 93.6-97.4), specificity (95.1%; 94.4-95.8), positive predictive value (69.7%; 65.9-73.2), and negative predictive value (99.5%; 99.2-99.7) in relation to rRT-PCR. Seventy-five days after finishing in vivo efficacy experiments, a real-life study (in vivo effectiveness) was executed among the riders of the Metro System of Medellin, deploying the human-canine teams without previous training or announcement.

388542285,2021-05-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: In the emergency department (ED) setting, rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 is likely associated with advantages to patients and healthcare workers, for example, enabling early but rationale use of limited isolation resources. Most recently, several SARS-CoV-2 rapid point-of-care antigen tests (AGTEST) became available. There is a growing need for data regarding their clinical utility and performance in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the real life setting EDs. METHODS: We implemented AGTEST (here: Roche/SD Biosensor) in all four adult and the one paediatric EDs at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin in our diagnostic testing strategy. Test indication was limited to symptomatic suspected COVID-19 patients. Detailed written instructions on who to test were distributed and testing personnel were trained in proper specimen collection and handling. In each suspected COVID-19 patient, two sequential deep oro-nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for viral tests. The first swab was collected for nucleic acid testing through SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR diagnostic panel (PCRTEST) in the central laboratory. The second swab was collected to perform the AGTEST. Analysis of routine data was prospectively planned and data were retrieved from the medical records after the inclusion period in the adult or paediatric ED. Diagnostic performance was calculated using the PCRTEST as reference standard. False negative and false positive AGTEST results were analysed individually and compared with viral concentrations derived from the calibrated PCRTEST. RESULTS: We included n = 483 patients including n = 202 from the paediatric ED. N = 10 patients had to be excluded due to missing data and finally n = 473 patients were analysed. In the adult cohort, the sensitivity of the AGTEST was 75.3 (95%CI: 65.8/83.4)% and the specificity was 100 (95%CI: 98.4/100)% with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 32.8%; the positive predictive value was 100 (95%CI: 95.7/100)% and the negative predictive value 89.2 (95%CI: 84.5/93.9)%. In the paediatric cohort, the sensitivity was 72.0 (95%CI: 53.3/86.7)%, the specificity was 99.4 (95%CI:97.3/99.9)% with a prevalence of 12.4%; the positive predictive value was 94.7 (95%CI: 78.3/99.7)% and the negative predictive value was 96.2 (95%CI:92.7/98.3)%. Thus, n = 22 adult and n = 7 paediatric patients showed false negative AGTEST results and only one false positive AGTEST occurred, in the paediatric cohort. Calculated viral concentrations from the rt-PCR lay between 3.16 and 9.51 log10 RNA copies/mL buffer. All false negative patients in the adult ED cohort, who had confirmed symptom onset at least seven days earlier had less than 5 × 105 RNA copies/mL buffer. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of AGTEST among symptomatic patients in the emergency setting is useful for the early identification of COVID-19, but patients who test negative require confirmation by PCRTEST and must stay isolated until this result becomes available. Adult patients with a false negative AGTEST and symptom onset at least one week earlier have typically a low SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and are likely no longer infectious",SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid immunoassay for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency department.,,,Biomarkers,10.17863/CAM.65352,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It affects the patient in life’s major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, and the usual treatment is performed with the help of anti- psychotic medication, which targets primarily the hallucinations, delirium, etc. Other symptoms, such as the decreased emotional expression or avolition, require a multidisciplinary approach, including psychopharmacology, cognitive training, and many forms of therapy. In this context, this paper addresses the use of digital technologies to design and develop innovative rehabilitation techniques, particularly focusing on mental health rehabilitation, and contributing for the promotion of well-being and health from a holistic perspective. In this context, serious games and virtual reality allows for creation of immersive environments that contribute to a more effective and lasting recovery, with improvements in terms of quality of life. The use of machine learning techniques will allow the real-time analysis of the data collected during the execution of the rehabilitation procedures, as well as enable their dynamic and automatic adaptation according to the profile and performance of the patients, by increasing or reducing the exercises’ difficulty. It relies on the acquisition of biometric and physiological signals, such as voice, heart rate, and game performance, to estimate the stress level, thus adapting the difficulty of the experience to the skills of the patient.

STARLINER aimed to characterise disease behaviour in patients with suspected ILD during the peri-diagnostic period using real-time home-based assessments.Methods: STARLINER (NCT03261037) was an international, multicentre study. Patients ≥ 50 years old with suspected ILD were followed throughout the peri-diagnostic period, consisting of a pre-diagnostic period (from enrolment to diagnosis) and a post-diagnostic period (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Study length was variable (≤ 18 months). The primary endpoint was time-adjusted semi-annual forced vital capacity (FVC) change measured during the peri-diagnostic period using daily home spirometry in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Secondary outcomes included changes in FVC (home spirometry) in patients with non-IPF ILD, changes in FVC (site spirometry), changes in physical functional capacity measured by daily home accelerometry and site 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IPF or non-IPF ILD.Results: Of the 178 patients enrolled in the study, 68 patients were diagnosed with IPF, 62 patients were diagnosed with non-IPF ILD, 9 patients received a non-ILD diagnosis and 39 patients did not receive a diagnosis. Technical and analytical issues led to problems in applying the prespecified linear regression model to analyse the home FVC data. Time-adjusted median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) semi-annual FVC change during the peri-diagnostic period measured using home and site spirometry, respectively, was - 147.7 (- 723.8, 376.2) ml and - 149.0 (- 314.6, 163.9) ml for IPF and 19.1 (- 194.9, 519.0) ml and - 23.4 (- 117.9, 133.5) ml in non-IPF ILD. A greater decline in steps per day was observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD, whereas an increase in 6MWD was observed for patients with IPF versus a decline in 6MWD for patients with non-IPF ILD. No clear patterns of disease behaviour were observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD for PROs.Conclusions: Despite home spirometry being feasible for most patients and centres, technical and analytical challenges in the home-based assessments prevented firm conclusions regarding disease behaviour.

CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions).

ADT being dynamic as the data is available instantaneous on occurrence of a medical event/visit adds value. Our goal is to utilize machine learning on unlabeled ADT data to identify patients who are at a high risk of being readmitted. We approached the problem in three parts. First, we labeled patient events using logical rules and finalized one of many readmission definitions that was more encapsulating of varied scenarios. Second, feature engineering was done which encapsulates the longitudinal timeline of each patient in a representative way considering all the contextual information.

BN have been applied in a wide range of real-world domains, such as medical diagnosis, forensic analysis, dependability assessment, risk management, etc. With respect to other types of models, BN provide relevant advantages: at the modelling level, the compact representation of the joint distribution of the system variables leads to the factorization of the set of possible states, avoiding the generation of the complete state space of the system; at the analysis level, inference algorithms can compute the probability distribution of any variable, possibly conditioned on the observation of the value (state) of other variables, so that predictive and diagnostic measures can be easily evaluated. During the years, BN have been extended in order to increase their modelling and analysis power; for instance, Dynamic Bayesian Networks and Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks take time into account, Hybrid Bayesian Networks deal with both discrete and continuous variables, Decision Networks contain decision nodes and value nodes. The aim of this Special Issue is to collect recent developments about inference algorithms, their applications to real-case studies, and their implementation in software tools","Editorial for the Special Issue on \u201cBayesian Networks: Inference Algorithms, Applications, and Software Tools\u201d",,,'MDPI AG',10.3390/a14050138,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
304935586,2018-06-30T22:22:06,"Advanced autonomous robotics space missions rely heavily on the flawless interaction of complex hardware, multiple sensors, and a mission-critical software system.  This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Our Integrated Software Health Management (ISWHM) system continuously monitors the hardware sensors and the software in real-time. The ISWHM uses Bayesian networks, compiled to arithmetic circuits, to model software and hardware interactions. Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.  As our initial demonstration platform, we use a primitive Lego rover. A Lego 
Mindstorms microcontroller is used to implement a highly simplified autonomous rover driving system, running on the OSEK real-time operating system. We demonstrate that our ISWHM, running on this small embedded microcontroller, can perform fault detection as well as on-board reasoning for advanced diagnosis and root-cause detection in real time",Software and System Health Management for Autonomous Robotics Missions,10.1184/r1/6710654.v1,,,10.1184/r1/6710654.v1,core,health,health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Mobile e-health applications provide users and healthcare practitioners with an insightful way to check users/patients’ status and monitor their daily activities. This paper proposes a cloud-based mobile e-health calorie system that can classify food objects in the plate and further compute the overall calorie of each food object with high accuracy. The novelty in our system is that we are not only offloading heavy computational functions of the system to the cloud, but also employing an intelligent cloud-broker mechanism to strategically and efficiently utilize cloud instances to provide accurate and improved time response results. The broker system uses a dynamic cloud allocation mechanism that takes decisions on allocating and de-allocating cloud instances in real-time for ensuring the average response time stays within a predefined threshold. In this paper, we further demonstrate various scenarios to explain the workflow of the cloud components including: segmentation, deep learning, indexing food images, decision making algorithms, calorie computation, scheduling management as part of the proposed cloud broker model. The implementation results of our system showed that the proposed cloud broker results in a 45% gain in the overall time taken to process the images in the cloud. With the use of dynamic cloud allocation mechanism, we were able to reduce the average time consumption by 77.21% when 60 images were processed in parallel",An intelligent cloud-based data processing broker for mobile e-health multimedia applications,10.1016/j.future.2016.03.019,,'Elsevier BV',"[{'title': 'Future Generation Computer Systems', 'identifiers': ['issn:0167-739X', '0167-739x']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

existed for many years. Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features.
Ergonomics, forensic anthropology, crime prevention or new human-machine interaction
systems and online activities, like e-commerce, e-learning, games, dating or social networks, are fields in which classifications of facial features are useful, for example, to create
digital interlocutors that optimize the interactions between human and machines. However,
classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported
low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. This
work presents a computer-based procedure to automatically classify facial features based
on their global appearance. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgements from human observers, and facilitates the development of
taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained through this procedure are presented

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2). Video detection of cells at 105, 104, 103, and 100 cells/mL is demonstrated in real time using un-reconstructed holograms.

162582664,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThis paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,,,HAL CCSD,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
339165045,2017-11-13T00:00:00,"[EN] Nowadays, there is a need to provide new applications which allow the definition and implementation of safe environments that
attends to the user needs and increases their wellbeing. In this sense, this paper introduces the EJaCalIVE framework which allows
the creation of emotional virtual environments that incorporate agents, eHealth related devices, human actors, and emotions
projecting them virtually and managing the interaction between all the elements. In this way, the proposed framework allows
the design and programming of intelligent virtual environments, as well as the simulation and detection of human emotions which
can be used for the improvement of the decision-making processes of the developed entities. The paper also shows a case study
that enforces the need of this framework in common environments like nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Concretely, the
case study proposes the simulation of a residence for the elderly. The main goal is to have an emotion-based simulation to train an
assistance robot avoiding the complexity involved in working with the real elders. The main advantage of the proposed framework
is to provide a safe environment, that is, an environment where users are able to interact safely with the system.This work is partially supported by the MINECO/FEDER TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R and the FPI Grant AP2013-01276 awarded to Jaime-Andres Rincon.

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations. The latter can be used as maintenance directions by a human operator in charge of production monitoring and control","WHODID: Web-based interface for Human-assisted factory Operations in fault Detection, Identification and Diagnosis",10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_47,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
287429785,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of wireless sensor networks, which are the key ingredient in the growing Internet of Things (IoT), has surged over the past few years with a widening range of applications in the industry, healthcare, agriculture, with a special attention to monitoring and tracking, often tied with security issues. In some applications, sensors can be deployed in remote, large unpopulated areas, whereas in others, they serve to monitor confined busy spaces. In either case, clustering the sensor network’s nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network’s lifetime. In the present paper, we survey and compare popular and advanced clustering schemes and provide a detailed analysis of their performance as a function of scale, type of collected data or their heterogeneity, and noise level.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,HAL CCSD,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

352137868,2017-03-31T00:00:00,"Foodborne illness afflicts 48 million people annually in the U.S. alone. Over 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from the infection. While preventable with proper food safety practices, the traditional restaurant inspection process has limited impact given the predictability and low frequency of inspections, and the dynamic nature of the kitchen environment. Despite this reality, the inspection process has remained largely unchanged for decades. CDC has even identified food safety as one of seven ”winnable battles”; however, progress to date has been limited. In this work, we demonstrate significant improvements in food safety by marrying AI and the standard inspection process. We apply machine learning to Twitter data, develop a system that automatically detects venues likely to pose a public health hazard, and demonstrate its efficacy in the Las Vegas metropolitan area in a double-blind experiment conducted over three months in collaboration with Nevada’s health department. By contrast, previous research in this domain has been limited to indirect correlative validation using only aggregate statistics. We show that adaptive inspection process is 64 percent more effective at identifying problematic venues than the current state of the art. If fully deployed, our approach could prevent over 9,000 cases of foodborne illness and 557 hospitalizations annually in Las Vegas alone.

However, it is common to find that ECG analysis methods reported are confined to off-line PC host operation. The authors present an arrhythmia classification method implemented on a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) platform intended for on-line, real-time ambulatory operation to classify eight heartbeat conditions: normal sinus rhythm (N), auricular fibrillation (AF), premature atrial contraction (PAC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinoauricular heart block (SHB) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The algorithm uses a wavelet transform process based on quadratic wavelets for identifying individual ECG waves and obtain a fiducial marker array. Classification is conducted by means of a Probabilistic Neural Network. The algorithm is tested with 17 ECG records obtained from the PhysioNet repository. The proposed classification procedure was tested initially on MATLAB and the results where compared with the equivalent analogue data fed to a DSP-based ECG data acquisition prototype through an arbitrary waveform generator. The results derived from confusion matrix tests yielded on-line classification accuracy of 92.69% (AF), 97.15% (N), 76.82% (PAC), 91.06% (LBBB), 87.5% (RBBB), 71.04% (PVC), 91.94% (SHB) and 95.45% (SVT), overall classification rate of 92.746% and 100% agreement between the MATLAB and on-line DSP implementations.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

Особливістю запропонованої системи є дворівнева архітектура: незалежна референсна система та підсистема, яка відповідає за адаптивну роботу.The development of adaptive system has been researched for a decade, but only recently machine learning problems became solvable. In this paper is presented an overview of current smart systems and the problem of development real adaptive and versatile data analysis system. Such system has to analyze multivariate signals of different nature. That is why the overview part is based on examples of biomedical human health monitoring systems (BHMS). BHMS have complex internal structure, to simplify it can be divided into three big tiers: tier of data acquisition, communication and analytics tiers. In the first tier, all data acquisition steps are made, including placement sensors to the specific location. The communication tier is responsible for gathering data from all available hardware and send it via wireless channel to the third layer. The analytical tier is the final destination of acquired data. This layer includes all algorithms which will be used for processing data and interpretation of the results. Such simple division allow us to specify and select our potential field of study and improvements. Specifically, in this paper the analytics tier will be explored and new system architecture will be proposed.
The crucial step in the adaptive systems development is solving reconfiguration problem. Nowadays, almost all data analysis systems have specific applicable fields. The main advantages of the latter are that they are robust, fast, but the development of such system can take a lot of time and reconfiguration of currently used systems will allow speed up that process. The reconfiguration is process of creation a specific targeting system from general system setup or currently known system. In this paper we have investigated problems, related with reconfiguration and proposing the theoretical basis for creation the reconfigurable adaptive system. The output structure is two-tier system, which allow to analyze any task from different field of study and then process it in a single setup. Each of the tier is considered as independent components, however the combination of the general reference system (tier one) and training agent subsystem (tier two) creates a highly adaptive system with reconfiguration properties. The reference system itself is a big storage of available algorithms which can be applied for certain problem and the algorithms workflow can be tuned for specific problem. Such adjustments can be made because of system training agent, which main purpose is to process input task and defined which algorithms can be applied. Such task classification problem can be solved by using machine learning algorithms.
Since, this paper presents only theoretical basis there is no precise implementation of proposed system. Currently we just gave a small overview of the future development of adaptive and reconfigurable systems.В данной работе были исследованы проблемы разработки универсальных и адаптивных систем анализа данных.

163105483,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band.

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells. Hence, the IncuCyte system and its NeuroTrack module provide an appealing platform for efficient in vitro studies of antifungal compounds and immunotherapeu-tic strategies in medical mycology.openWurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P.Wurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P","Live monitoring and analysis of fungal growth, viability, and mycelial morphology using the incucyte neurotrack processing module",10.1128/mBio.00673-19,https://core.ac.uk/download/233571269.pdf,'American Society for Microbiology',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

275634127,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In this paper, we describe a new low-cost and portable electronic nose instrument, the Multisensory Odor Olfactory System MOOSY4. This prototype is based on only four metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors suitable for IoT technology. The system architecture consists of four stages: data acquisition, data storage, data processing, and user interfacing. The designed eNose was tested with experiment for detection of volatile components in water pollution, as a dimethyl disulphide or dimethyl diselenide or sulphur. Therefore, the results provide evidence that odor information can be recognized with around 86% efficiency, detecting smells unwanted in the water and improving the quality control in bottled water factories.This work was supported by the I+D+i Program of the Generalitat Valenciana, Spain [AICO/2016/046], and the II Program UPV-La Fe [2013/0504].Climent-Martí, E.; Pelegrí Sebastiá, J.; Sogorb Devesa, T.; Talens-Felis, J.; Chilo, J.

Monitoring it can help to discover the causes of a low wellness levels aiding people in the improvement of their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a system to monitor the wellness state of people utilizing Likert¿s scale to determine the state of the user through an emoticon-based human¿computer interaction. The system is intended for domestic environments and measures the habitability conditions of the dwelling (such as temperature, humidity, luminosity and noise) employing sensors. An algorithm is designed in order to establish how to measure those conditions and to calculate the statistics that allows tracking their progress. The obtained information is presented to the user to compare his/her wellness state with the habitability conditions. Measures in a real domestic environment were performed in order to determine the configuration of our system. The energy efficiency of the algorithm provides an improvement between 99.36 and 99.62% in the energy consumption depending on the selected parameters.This work has been partially supported by the “Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación”, through the “Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008–2011” and by the “Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte”, through the grand “Ayudas para contratos predoctorales de Formación del Profesorado Universitario FPU14/02953”.García-García, L.; Parra-Boronat, L.; Romero Martínez, JO.; Lloret, J.

industrial automation, virtual reality, e-health, and several intelligent applications, machine learning (ML)

is expected to be essential to assist in making the 5G vision conceivable. This paper focuses on the potential

solutions for 5G from an ML-perspective. First, we establish the fundamental concepts of supervised,

unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, taking a look at what has been done so far in the adoption of

ML in the context of mobile and wireless communication, organizing the literature in terms of the types of

learning.We then discuss the promising approaches for how ML can contribute to supporting each target 5G

network requirement, emphasizing its specific use cases and evaluating the impact and limitations they have

on the operation of the network. Lastly, this paper investigates the potential features of Beyond 5G (B5G),

providing future research directions for how ML can contribute to realizing B5G. This article is intended

74320701,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"The increasing application of process-oriented approaches in new challenging dynamic domains beyond business computing (e.g., healthcare, emergency management, factories of the future, home automation, etc.) has led to reconsider the level of flexibility and support required to manage complex knowledge-intensive processes in such domains. A knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making and coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves performing complex tasks in the “physical” real world to achieve a common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable, and knowledge-intensive processes must be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue. To tackle this issue, in this paper we present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process Management System featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated adaptation of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able to automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions occur, without explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions and without the intervention of domain experts at runtime, aiming at reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc changes, and thus at relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish this, we make use of well-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. The approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been implemented and validated with a case study based on real knowledge-intensive processes coming from an emergency management domain",Intelligent Process Adaptation in the SmartPM System,10.1145/2948071,,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
217804495,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"A new compact diagnostic device exploiting the integration of screen printed electrode-based immunosensors and remote-controlled IoT-WiFi acquisition board has been realized and validated for diagnosis of Celiac Disease as case of study. The immunodevice is based on chemisorption of open tissue transglutaminase enzyme on the surface of gold nanoparticles-functionalized carbon screen printed electrodes. IgA and IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase target antibodies are recognized by the immobilized bioreceptor as highly specific biomarkers related to Celiac Disease. The signal from the amperometric sensor is acquired and processed through on-purpose developed IoT-WiFi integrated board, allowing for real-time data sharing on cloud services to directly notify all users (physicians, caregivers, etc.) on device outcome. The proposed solution does not require customized hardware or software.

200756944,2019-04-01T00:00:00,"Control of blood glucose is essential for diabetes management. Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient state prediction among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of forecasting glucose levels with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38±0.71 [mg/dL] over a 30-minute horizon, RMSE = 18.87±2.25 [mg/dL] over a 60-minute horizon) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.07±2.35 [mg/dL] for 30-minute, RMSE = 33.27±4.79\% for 60-minute). In addition, the model provides competitive performance in providing effective prediction horizon ( PHeff) with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset ( PHeff = 29.0±0.7 for 30-min and PHeff = 49.8±2.9 for 60-min) and in a real patient dataset ( PHeff = 19.3±3.1 for 30-min and PHeff = 29.3±9.4 for 60-min). This approach is evaluated on a dataset of 10 simulated cases generated from the UVa/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of 10 real cases each containing glucose readings, insulin bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data.

This setting is representative of the real-world machine learning applications. For instance, in the health-care domain, obtaining every single measurement comes with a cost. We propose Icebreaker, a principled framework for element-wise training data acquisition. Icebreaker introduces a full Bayesian Deep Latent Gaussian Model (BELGAM) with a novel inference method, which combines recent advances in amortized inference and stochastic gradient MCMC to enable fast and accurate posterior inference. By utilizing BELGAM's ability to fully quantify model uncertainty, we also propose two information acquisition functions for imputation and active prediction problems. We demonstrate that BELGAM performs significantly better than previous variational autoencoder (VAE) based models, when the data set size is small, using both machine learning benchmarks and real-world recommender systems and health-care applications. Moreover, Icebreaker not only demonstrates improved performance compared to baselines, but it is also capable of achieving better test performance with less training data available",Icebreaker: Element-wise efficient information acquisition with a Bayesian deep latent gaussian model,,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

275782095,2019,"International audienceBACKGROUND: Mortality surveillance is of fundamental importance to public health surveillance. The real-time recording of death certificates, thanks to Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS), provides valuable data for reactive mortality surveillance based on medical causes of death in free-text format. Reactive mortality surveillance is based on the monitoring of mortality syndromic groups (MSGs). An MSG is a cluster of medical causes of death (pathologies, syndromes or symptoms) that meets the objectives of early detection and impact assessment of public health events. The aim of this study is to implement and measure the performance of a rule-based method and two supervised models for automatic free-text cause of death classification from death certificates in order to implement them for routine surveillance.METHOD: A rule-based method was implemented using four processing steps: standardization rules, splitting causes of death using delimiters, spelling corrections and dictionary projection. A supervised machine learning method using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was also implemented. Two models were produced using different features (SVM1 based solely on surface features and SVM2 combining surface features and MSGs classified by the rule-based method as feature vectors). The evaluation was conducted using an annotated subset of electronic death certificates received between 2012 and 2016. Classification performance was evaluated on seven MSGs (Influenza, Low respiratory diseases, Asphyxia/abnormal respiration, Acute respiratory disease, Sepsis, Chronic digestive diseases, and Chronic endocrine diseases).RESULTS: The rule-based method and the SVM2 model displayed a high performance with F-measures over 0.94 for all MSGs. Precision and recall were slightly higher for the rule-based method and the SVM2 model. An error-analysis shows that errors were not specific to an MSG.CONCLUSION: The high performance of the rule-based method and SVM2 model will allow us to set-up a reactive mortality surveillance system based on free-text death certificates. This surveillance will be an added-value for public health decision making",Automatic classification of free-text medical causes from death certificates for reactive mortality surveillance in France,,,Elsevier,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2).

189855542,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322372256,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.Scopu",A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier,10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Also, research-level skin-wearable devices, while excelling in some aspects, fall short as concept-only presentations due to the fundamental challenges of active wireless communication and integration as a single device platform. Here, an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable hybrid electronics with key capabilities for real-time physiological monitoring, automatic detection of signal abnormality via deep-learning, and a long-range wireless connectivity (up to 15 m) is introduced. The strategic integration of thin-film electronic layers with hyperelastic elastomers allows the overall device to adhere and deform naturally with the human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. The stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact are capable of generating clinical-grade electrocardiograms and accurate analysis of heart and respiratory rates while the motion sensor assesses physical activities. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time physiological classifications demonstrates the feasibility of multifaceted analysis with a high clinical relevance.

System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

390020643,2019-07-30T00:00:00,"The economic-legal analysis of the state and trends of the development of technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) has been carried out. The influence of AI on the development of society, eco­nomic effect, methods and the field of application, the state of developments in the world and Ukraine are analyzed. In the next decade, AI will become the main mar­ket trend and the best business tool. The contribution of intellectual technologies to global GDP is estimated at 15.7 trillion. dollars In the next 5-10 years, China will be the leader in the successful operation and adaptation of AI technologies. Ac­cording to analysts, the most benefit from AI technologies will be in the areas of fi­nancial services, retail and medicine.The scientific and inventive activity in the sphere of AI, the role of protection of in­tellectual property (patent and copyright), and the maintenance of the balance of com­peting interests are researched. Recently, the number of inventions based on AI has sharply increased. The leaders in the number of such inventions are American compa­nies IBM and Microsoft. This growth is due to the fact that in recent years AI has evolved from the theoretical concept into a real product that gains the world market. Since the advent of AI in the 50’s of the last century, inventors and researchers have applied for almost 340 thousand inventions based on AI (as of the end of 2016) and published more than 1.6 million scientific articles. The transport sector, including au­tonomous vehicles, is one of the sectors with the highest rates of growth in the appli­cation of AI. China has become a global leader in increasing the number of patents in the AI sphere over the past five years.By the number of companies working in the sphere of AI, Ukraine is among the three leaders among the countries of Eastern Europe. There are 57 AI companies in Ukraine and it has 11 investorsGeneralized practice of state regulation of activity in the sphere of AI in indus­trialized countries and EU countries. More and more countries are developing na­tional AI strategies. Thus, 17 countries, including Canada, China, Denmark, France, India, South Korea and Taiwan, have already announced their AI strate­gies. Some of them invest billions of dollars in this area. China, for example, has invested more than $ 10 billion in this technological trend, followed by South Korea — $ 2 billion and France — $ 1.5 billion. Governmental structures from dif­ferent countries are concerned about the need to develop relevant national strate­gies, programs and regulation of AI legislative level. Identified existing problems and suggested ways to solve them. Problems constraining the development of AI in Ukraine: the absence of a strategy for the development of AI, the domestic infra­structure for its work and the weakness of the business about existing fundamen­tal scientific developments in the field of AI, insufficient for the implementation of AI level of digitalization of companies, the lack of a high level of data work, and is also a misunderstanding of the implementation guidance in the AI company.В статье представлен экономико-правовой анализ состояния и тенденций развития технологий искусственного интеллекта (ИИ).

It is shown that the Internet of Things creates conditions for the emergence of a synergetic effect from the combination of possibilities of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, set of sensors, mathematical algorithms for processing large data (Big Data), robotic devices of various purposes, data transmission systems (Internet), which allows to provide various services and perform various work with or without the participation of people. The role of the state in promoting the development of IP, the existing problems and ways of their solution are shown. Many governments in recent years are taking measures to analyze the state of affairs with the introduction of IP technologies, the localization of problems and threats that may or may occur in the future in order to formulate a common strategy for the development of industry for the production of IP technologies and their application in various sectors of the economy and public life. The patent landscape of the IP is analyzed, the most productive companies and inventors of IP are discovered, the dynamics of patenting in the IP environment, the value of patents, patent research problems are shown. The problems of intellectual property protection in the sphere of IP, in particular, copyright, inventions, trademarks, commercial secrets, information security are considered. The intellectual potential and untapped potential of Ukraine in the development of IP technologies are considered.

251203367,2018-10-11T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Logistic regression is a popular technique used in machine learning to construct classification models. Since the construction of such models is based on computing with large datasets, it is an appealing idea to outsource this computation to a cloud service. The privacy-sensitive nature of the input data requires appropriate privacy preserving measures before outsourcing it. Homomorphic encryption enables one to compute on encrypted data directly, without decryption and can be used to mitigate the privacy concerns raised by using a cloud service. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an algorithm (and its implementation) to train a logistic regression model on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. The core of our algorithm consists of a new iterative method that can be seen as a simplified form of the fixed Hessian method, but with a much lower multiplicative complexity. RESULTS: We test the new method on two interesting real life applications: the first application is in medicine and constructs a model to predict the probability for a patient to have cancer, given genomic data as input; the second application is in finance and the model predicts the probability of a credit card transaction to be fraudulent. The method produces accurate results for both applications, comparable to running standard algorithms on plaintext data. CONCLUSIONS: This article introduces a new simple iterative algorithm to train a logistic regression model that is tailored to be applied on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. This algorithm can be used as a privacy-preserving technique to build a binary classification model and can be applied in a wide range of problems that can be modelled with logistic regression. Our implementation results show that our method can handle the large datasets used in logistic regression training.status: publishe",Privacy-preserving logistic regression training,10.1186/s12920-018-0398-y,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"[{'title': 'BMC Medical Genomics', 'identifiers': ['1755-8794', 'issn:1755-8794']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Abdominal cancer is a widely prevalent group of tumours with a high level of mortality if diagnosed at a late stage. Although the cancer death rates have in general declined over the past few decades, the mortality from tumours in the hepatoduodenal area has significantly increased in recent years. The broader use of minimal access surgery (MAS) for diagnostics and treatment can significantly improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients after surgery. This work aims to develop and characterise an appropriate technical implementation for tissue endogenous fluorescence (TEF) and assess the efficiency of machine learning methods for the real-time diagnosis of tumours in the hepatoduodenal area. In this paper, we present the results of the machine learning approach applied to the optically guided MAS. We have elaborated tissue fluorescence approach with a fibre-optic probe to record the TEF and blood perfusion parameters during MAS in patients with cancers in the hepatoduodenal area. The measurements from the laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) channel were used as a sensor of the tissue vitality to reduce variability in TEF data. Also, we evaluated how the blood perfusion oscillations are changed in the tumour tissue. The evaluated amplitudes of the cardiac (0.6–1.6 Hz) and respiratory (0.2–0.6 Hz) oscillations was significantly higher in intact tissues (p %lt; 0.001) compared to the cancerous ones, while the myogenic (0.2–0.06 Hz) oscillation did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference. Our results demonstrate that a fibre-optic TEF probe accompanied with ML algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbours or AdaBoost is highly promising for the real-time in situ differentiation between cancerous and healthy tissues by detecting the information about the tissue type that is encoded in the fluorescence spectrum. Also, we show that the detection can be supplemented and enhanced by parallel collection and classification of blood perfusion oscillations",Machine learning aided photonic diagnostic system for minimally invasive optically guided surgery in the hepatoduodenal area,,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478671759,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration",Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, annotation is mostly performed by observers with medical background and is incredibly costly and time-consuming, creating a major bottleneck for the above-mentioned technologies. In this paper, we propose a way to eliminate, or at least limit, the human intervention in the annotation process.  Methods - Meaningful information about interaction between objects is inherently available in virtual reality environments. We propose a strategy to convert automatically this information into annotations in order to provide as output individual surgical process models.  Validation - We implemented our approach through a peg-transfer task simulator and compared it to manual annotations. To assess the impact of our contribution, we studied both intra- and inter-observer variability.  Results and conclusion - In average, manual annotations took more than 12 min for 1 min of video to achieve low-level physical activity annotation, whereas automatic annotation is achieved in less than a second for the same video period. We also demonstrated that manual annotation introduced mistakes as well as intra- and inter-observer variability that our method is able to suppress due to the high precision and reproducibility",Automatic annotation of surgical activities using virtual reality environments,10.1007/s11548-019-02008-x,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the MBL serum level and the relative expression of MBL mRNA in RVVC using real-time PCR for the first time. The case-control study included 40 female participants suffering from RVVC and 40 healthy individuals. The MBL serum level was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. The relative mRNA expression of the MBL gene was quantified using real-time PCR. Data analysis was carried out by spss software. The MBL concentration was significantly higher in the participants suffering from RVVC compared to the control group (0.330 ng/mL vs 0.253 ng/mL). The prognostic value (P < .001) for RVVC diagnosis has been calculated. Quantitative RT-PCR results from 35 samples showed a low to significant values for mRNA levels corresponding to MBL gene expression (1-352 folds) (P < .001).

370074707,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The high capacity of neural networks allows fitting models to data with high precision, but makes generalization to unseen data a challenge. If a domain shift exists, i.e. differences in image statistics between training and test data, care needs to be taken to ensure reliable deployment in real-world scenarios. In digital pathology, domain shift can be manifested in differences between whole-slide images, introduced by for example differences in acquisition pipeline - between medical centers or over time. In order to harness the great potential presented by deep learning in histopathology, and ensure consistent model behavior, we need a deeper understanding of domain shift and its consequences, such that a model's predictions on new data can be trusted. This work focuses on the internal representation learned by trained convolutional neural networks, and shows how this can be used to formulate a novel measure - the representation shift - for quantifying the magnitude of model specific domain shift. We perform a study on domain shift in tumor classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained images, by considering different datasets, models, and techniques for preparing data in order to reduce the domain shift. The results show how the proposed measure has a high correlation with drop in performance when testing a model across a large number of different types of domain shifts, and how it improves on existing techniques for measuring data shift and uncertainty. The proposed measure can reveal how sensitive a model is to domain variations, and can be used to detect new data that a model will have problems generalizing to.

To solve the intrasubject SMM variability, we propose a robust CNN model for SMM detection within subjects, whose parameters are set according to a proper analysis of SMM signals, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art SMM classification works. And, to solve the intersubject variability, we propose a global, fast, and light-weight framework for SMM detection across subjects which combines a knowledge transfer technique with an SVM classifier, therefore resolving the “real-life” medical issue associated with the lack of supervised SMMs per testing subject in particular.

322840422,2019-11-01T00:00:00,"International audienceWireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a quite suitable communication tool for medical IoT devices that are deployed to collect physiological parameters and forecast real-time events in order to facilitate the diagnostic decision-making for the medical staff. However, sensor readings may be inaccurate due to resource-constrained devices, sensor misplacement, hardware faults, and other environmental factors. Therefore, anomaly detection is envisioned as a promising approach to deal with unreliable and malicious data injection to improve remote patient monitoring systems and reduce false medical diagnosis. In this context, several data analysis and machine learning tools have been proposed to detect abnormal deviations in WBAN. Nevertheless, no one considers the dynamic context changes of WBAN to provide adaptive and dynamic outlier detection. In addition, most of them ignore the co-existence of strong spatial and temporal correlations between monitored physiological attributes. To this end, we propose a two-level lightweight and adaptive anomaly detection approach to discard false alarms caused by faulty measurements and raise alarms only when a patient seems to be in emergency situations. In the first level, a game-theoretic technique is introduced wherein body-worn sensor nodes exploit the spatiotemporal correlation among readings to locally and adaptively detect anomalous events according to the dynamic context changes of WBAN. In the second level, we apply the Mahalanobis distance in the Local Processing Unit (LPU) which has a global view for multivariate analysis. Our main objective is to ensure a tradeoff between detection accuracy, false positive rates, and network performance while considering the WBAN environment constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated through numerical simulations on a real physiological data set. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of achieving high detection accuracy with low false alarm rate and energy consumption",Game-Based Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks,10.1016/j.comnet.2019.106870,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

151188608,2018-02-12T15:59:05,"This is the final version of the article. Available from BMJ Publishing Group via the DOI in this record.Objective Bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with adverse human health outcomes and exposure to this compound is near-ubiquitous in the Western world. We aimed to examine whether self-moderation of BPA exposure is possible by altering diet in a real-world setting.

Design An Engaged Research dietary intervention study designed, implemented and analysed by healthy teenagers from six schools and undertaken in their own homes.

Participants A total of 94 students aged between 17 and 19 years from schools in the South West of the UK provided diet diaries and urine samples for analysis.

Intervention Researcher participants designed a set of literature-informed guidelines for the reduction of dietary BPA to be followed for 7 days.

Main outcome measures Creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA levels were taken before and after the intervention. Information on packaging and food/drink ingested was used to calculate a BPA risk score for anticipated exposure. A qualitative analysis was carried out to identify themes addressing long-term sustainability of the diet.

Results BPA was detected in urine of 86% of participants at baseline at a median value of 1.22 ng/mL (IQR 1.99). No effect of the intervention diet on BPA levels was identified overall (P=0.25), but there was a positive association in those participants who showed a drop in urinary BPA concentration postintervention and their initial BPA level (P=0.003). Qualitative analysis identified themes around feelings of lifestyle restriction and the inadequacy of current labelling practices.

Conclusions We found no evidence in this self-administered intervention study that it was possible to moderate BPA exposure by diet in a real-world setting. Furthermore, our study participants indicated that they would be unlikely to sustain such a diet long term, due to the difficulty in identifying BPA-free foods.This study was funded by a Wellcome Trust People Award to LWH and TSG (grant no 105162/Z/14/Z).

299968308,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Intracranial hemorrhage is a medical emergency that requires urgent diagnosis and immediate treatment to improve patient outcome. Machine learning algorithms can be used to perform medical image classification and assist clinicians in diagnosing radiological scans. In this paper, we apply 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) to classify computed tomography (CT) brain scans into normal scans (N) and abnormal scans containing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), acute subdural hemorrhage (ASDH) and brain polytrauma hemorrhage (BPH). The dataset used consists of 399 volumetric CT brain images representing approximately 12,000 images from the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. We used a 3D CNN to perform both 2-class (normal versus a specific abnormal class) and 4-class classification (between normal, SAH, IPH, ASDH). We apply image thresholding at the image pre-processing step, that improves 3D CNN classification accuracy and performance by accentuating the pixel intensities that contribute most to feature discrimination. For 2-class classification, the F1 scores for various pairs of medical diagnoses ranged from 0.706 to 0.902 without thresholding. With thresholding implemented, the F1 scores improved and ranged from 0.919 to 0.952. Our results are comparable to, and in some cases, exceed the results published in other work applying 3D CNN to CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan classification.

METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing. CONCLUSIONS:As AI-based data analysis and clinical decision support systems begin to be implemented in healthcare systems around the world, further openness of clinical effectiveness and mechanisms of action may be required by safety-conscious healthcare policy-makers to ensure they are clinically effective in real world use",An Open Science Approach to Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare,10.1055/s-0039-1677898,,'Georg Thieme Verlag KG',"[{'title': 'Yearbook of Medical Informatics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2364-0502', '2364-0502', 'issn:0943-4747', '0943-4747']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recent developments based on the concept of Industry 4.0 such as big data, new communication protocols and artificial intelligence provide several new avenues to explore. In the specific context of machining, we are working toward the development of a system capable of making the prognostic of the quality (in terms of dimensional conformance) of a workpiece in real time while it is being manufactured. The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms. In the end, this paper depicts the system architecture as well as its interactions between the multiple systems and software already in place at our industrial partner. This paper also shows preliminary results describing the relationship between the workpiece quality (in terms of respect toward the dimensional requirements) and the extracted features from the sensors signals. We conclude that it is now possible to do the diagnostic of a cutting operation. Additionally, with the same information we show that it is possible to quickly do the general diagnostic of the health state of the machine. Future work regarding this project will include data acquisition from a wider range of products (i.e. different shapes, materials, processes, etc.) and the development of a machine learning based prognostic model",Toward the quality prognostic of an aircraft engine workpiece in Inconel Alloy 625: case study and proposed system architecture,,,HAL CCSD,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
365584409,2019-11-07T00:00:00,"Purpose

Recently, several attempts were conducted to transfer deep learning to medical image reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a result, many approaches use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable problems.





Methods

PYRO‐NN is a generalized framework to embed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow. The current status includes state‐of‐the‐art parallel‐, fan‐, and cone‐beam projectors, and back‐projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow layers. On top, the framework provides a high‐level Python API to conduct FBP and iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems.





Results

The framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to design end‐to‐end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction algorithms. The high‐level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as known from Tensorflow. All algorithms and tools are referenced to a scientific publication and are compared to existing non‐deep learning reconstruction frameworks. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, the framework comes with baseline experiments, which are described in the supplementary material. The framework is available as open‐source software under the Apache 2.0 licence at https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN.





Conclusions

PYRO‐NN comes with the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end‐to‐end trainable neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We believe that the framework will be a step toward reproducible research and give the medical physics community a toolkit to elevate medical image reconstruction with new deep learning techniques",Technical Note: PYRO‐NN: Python reconstruction operators in neural networks,10.1002/mp.13753,,'Wiley',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

333919275,2020-04-28T00:00:00,"International audienceBackground: High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota.Methods: Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results.Results: AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3-11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa.Conclusion: Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa. For fungal analysis, ITS2 allowed the detection of a greater number of minor taxa compared with ITS1",Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?,10.1371/journal.pone.0232215,,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The objective of work is the investigation of one-minute intervals of RR data series to definite the dataset of parameters for estimation of physiological state in real time mode. The methodology of investigation is based on the data proc-essing of the standard indicators of heart rate variability (HRV), fractal analysis, machine learning methods (k-means) and fac-tor analysis. Testing signals were been taken from the European data base of medical signals PhysioNet. Scatterogram analysis of the testing diurnal record with normal sinus rhythm and arrhythmia was performed. A strong correlation between the coeffi-cient of fractal dimension and standard indications of HRV for normal sinus rhythm and null correlation for arythmia had been observed. Standard indicators of HRV and coefficient of fractal dimension for each one-minute interval were calculated and estimated with the Student’s average test that had shown inexpediency of scaterogram surface using. Cluster analysis based on the k-means method to determine general probabilistic data series groups was performed. Initial data for cluster analysis is a matrix of standard HRV indicators, coefficient of fractal dimension and geometric parameters of scatetogram. Entire objects from the one-minute dataset were grouped into six clusters. The average value of scatterogram parameters (coefficient of fractal dimension, long and short axes and their ration) for selected clusters were found with probability more than 95 %. Data set of parameters to analyze the one-minute intervals of RR-dataset was defined with fractal analysis. Proposed dataset of indicators for estimation one-minute intervals includes: pNN50 (the proportion derived by dividing the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms by the total number of NN intervals), long SD2 and short SD1 ellipse axes, ratio SD2/SD1, triangular index TI, mean heart rate and coefficient of fractal dimension Df.

Considering the everincreasing complexity of the network, and the emergence of novel use cases such as autonomous cars, industrial automation, virtual reality, e-health, and several intelligent applications, machine learning (ML) is expected to be essential to assist in making the 5G vision conceivable. This paper focuses on the potential solutions for 5G from an ML-perspective. First, we establish the fundamental concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, taking a look at what has been done so far in the adoption of ML in the context of mobile and wireless communication, organizing the literature in terms of the types of learning.We then discuss the promising approaches for how ML can contribute to supporting each target 5G network requirement, emphasizing its specific use cases and evaluating the impact and limitations they have on the operation of the network.

427136958,,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a prevalent technology in the IT industry. One of the industries that can benefit extensively in this technology is healthcare. However, the healthcare IoT is still under debate with several studies suggesting it is lack of interoperability, security, and too much complexity. Even more, the risk involved in deploying it is still enormous. Many traditional risk assessment models are unable to provide a specific IoT risk guideline and specification, especially in the healthcare area. Thus, it is essential to understand the full extent of the IoT risk and how to manage its risk in the healthcare area. The risk management models, such as NIST SP 800-30, ISO/IEC 27005, OCTAVE, CRAMM, and EBIOS, which are among the leading and widely used in many areas and healthcare fields, have also been described. Besides, this paper includes a review of three IoT risk assessment models that are based on ABA-IDS, Deep Learning, and AHP-SVM. Based on the review analysis, we proposed a new enhanced healthcare IoT risk assessment model, which aims to provide a real-time monitoring and mitigating risks that incorporate the NIST SP 800-30 framework, ABA-IDS, and CNN deep learning.

477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R).

With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events.

440959518,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The control of plant leaf diseases is crucial as it affects the quality and production of plant species with an effect on the economy of any country. Automated identification and classification of plant leaf diseases is, therefore, essential for the reduction of economic losses and the conservation of specific species. Various Machine Learning (ML) models have previously been proposed to detect and identify plant leaf disease; however, they lack usability due to hardware sophistication, limited scalability and realistic use inefficiency. By implementing automatic detection and classification of leaf diseases in fruit trees (apple, grape, peach and strawberry) and vegetable plants (potato and tomato) through scalable transfer learning on Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker and importing it into AWS DeepLens for real-time functional usability, our proposed DeepLens Classification and Detection Model (DCDM) addresses such limitations. Scalability and ubiquitous access to our approach is provided by cloud integration. Our experiments on an extensive image data set of healthy and unhealthy fruit trees and vegetable plant leaves showed 98.78% accuracy with a real-time diagnosis of diseases of plant leaves. To train DCDM deep learning model, we used forty thousand images and then evaluated it on ten thousand images. It takes an average of 0.349s to test an image for disease diagnosis and classification using AWS DeepLens, providing the consumer with disease information in less than a second",Real-time plant health assessment via implementing cloud-based scalable transfer learning on AWS DeepLens.,10.1371/journal.pone.0243243,,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',"[{'title': 'PLoS ONE', 'identifiers': ['issn:1932-6203', '1932-6203']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
440978332,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND:High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota. METHODS:Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results. RESULTS:AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3-11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa. CONCLUSION:Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa. For fungal analysis, ITS2 allowed the detection of a greater number of minor taxa compared with ITS1",Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?,10.1371/journal.pone.0232215,,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',"[{'title': 'PLoS ONE', 'identifiers': ['issn:1932-6203', '1932-6203']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
346545484,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly",VIS4ML: an ontology for visual analytics assisted machine learning,,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Data that are routinely generated from, for example, electronic medical records and smart devices have become progressively easier and cheaper to collect, process, and analyze. In recent decades, this has prompted a substantial increase in biomedical research efforts outside traditional clinical trial settings. Despite the apparent enthusiasm of researchers, funders, and the media, evidence is scarce for successful implementation of products, algorithms, and services arising that make a real difference to clinical care. This article collection provides concrete examples of how “big data” can be used to advance healthcare and discusses some of the limitations and challenges encountered with this type of research. It primarily focuses on real-world data, such as electronic medical records and genomic medicine, considers new developments in AI and digital health, and discusses ethical considerations and issues related to data sharing.

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an acute-phase protein that plays a key role in the innate immunity defence against infectious disease. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the MBL serum level and the relative expression of MBL mRNA in RVVC using real-time PCR for the first time. The case-control study included 40 female participants suffering from RVVC and 40 healthy individuals. The MBL serum level was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. The relative mRNA expression of the MBL gene was quantified using real-time PCR. Data analysis was carried out by spss software. The MBL concentration was significantly higher in the participants suffering from RVVC compared to the control group (0.330Â ng/mL vs 0.253Â ng/mL). The prognostic value (PÂ <.001) for RVVC diagnosis has been calculated. Quantitative RT-PCR results from 35 samples showed a low to significant values for mRNA levels corresponding to MBL gene expression (1-352 folds) (PÂ <.001).

300465489,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
287732361,2019-12-01T00:00:00,"Accurate detection of pathological conditions in human subjects can be achieved through off-line analysis of recorded biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, human diagnosis is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for diagnosing professionals. In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural processing system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis of pathological conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible pathological conditions, or to trigger an off-line data recording system for further analysis by a medical professional. We apply the system to real-time classification of ECG data for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and pathological rhythms. Multi-channel analog ECG traces are encoded as asynchronous streams of binary events and processed using a spiking recurrent neural network operated in a reservoir computing paradigm. An event-driven neuron output layer is then trained to recognize one of several pathologies. Finally, the filtered activity of this output layer is used to generate a binary trigger signal indicating the presence or absence of a pathological pattern.

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human–computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one ﬁnds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The ﬁrst branch explores geo-metric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the ﬁnal classiﬁca-tion score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on ﬁve benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces.

To validate our model in the consecutive speeches during time-outs, we generated 200 time-out speeches for cataract surgeries by randomly selecting the surgical statuses of the surgical participants. After the training process, the deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% for the validation dataset of short-word audio clips. Our deep learning-based smart speaker achieved an accuracy of 93.5% for the 200 time-out speeches. The surgical and procedural accuracy was 100%. Additionally, on validating the deep learning model by using web-generated time-out speeches and video clips for general surgery, the model exhibited a robust and good performance. In this pilot study, the proposed deep learning-based smart speaker was able to successfully confirm the surgical information during the time-out speech. Future studies should focus on collecting real-world time-out data and automatically connecting the device to electronic health records. Adopting smart speaker-assisted time-out phases will improve the patients' safety during cataract surgeries, particularly in relation to wrong-site surgeries",Deep learning-based smart speaker to confirm surgical sites for cataract surgeries: A pilot study.,10.1371/journal.pone.0231322,,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',"[{'title': 'PLoS ONE', 'identifiers': ['issn:1932-6203', '1932-6203']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

395142972,2019-08-11T00:00:00,"[EN] Modelling the dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles, such as buses or trucks, can be very useful for driving simulation and training, autonomous driving, crash analysis, etc. However, dynamic modelling of a vehicle is a difficult task because there are many subsystems and signals that affect its behaviour. In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

288328958,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration.publishedVersio",Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,https://core.ac.uk/download/288328958.pdf,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s.

370074721,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

196141017,2018,"According to statistics, every fifth married couple is faced with the inability to conceive a child. Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample. At the final stage of study, the program's functioningwas tested on real data.За статистикою, кожна п'ята подружня пара стикається з неможливістю зачаття дитини.

200793946,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Augmented reality (AR) is a new technology. Very few people know about its development, which began in 1970s from massive and primitive devices. Now AR is at the very peak of its improvement in the form of various software. Augmented reality has its application in the following devices: glasses, phones, tablets. Augmented reality works on the basis of two stages: object recognition and marker tracking. Recognition occurs on the basis of machine learning and tracking of markers by finding certain elements or special markers. The analogue of this principle of operation is SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building). But the best results are achieved with the simultaneous use of two technologies. AR is involved in different areas: education, medicine, entertainment, military training. For education, three-dimensional 3D models are used, which are more visual for students and simplify their studies. In entertainment, AR has found a place for itself in various social networks in the form of masks (Snapchat), games (Pokemon GO) and others. In medicine, in addition to training, AR is used to visualize the internal organs of patients. Augmented reality has great potential for development in practical application in everyday life environments because it does not require high hardware characteristics.Дополненная реальность, или AR (augmented reality) – новая технология, развитие которой сейчас мало кому известно.

Дополненная реальность имеет свое применение в следующий устройствах: очки, телефоны, планшеты. AR работает на основе двух этапов: распознавание объектов и отслеживание маркеров. Распознавание происходит на базе машинного обучения, а отслеживание маркеров путем нахождения определенных элементов или специальных маркеров. Аналогом данного принципа работы является технология SLAM. Но наилучшие результаты достигаются при одновременном использовании двух технологий. AR заполняет все больше сфер. Для образования используют объемные 3D модели, которые являются более наглядными для студентов и упрощают их обучение. В развлечениях AR нашло себе место в различных социальных сетях в виде масок (Snapchat), игр (Pokemon GO) и других.

442048635,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Roll-to-Roll (R2R) processing is a common processing method for flexible photoelectric film materials. Due to the physical properties of the materials, the change in the performance of the R2R processing equipment can easily cause deformation of the flexible film material, it is particularly important to predict the performance degradation of the processing equipment. Based on the accuracy and real-time requirements of performance degradation prediction, a PTS-FNN model for performance degradation prediction was proposed in this paper, which combines the Possibilistic C-Means (PCM) fuzzy clustering and Takagi–Sugeno Fuzzy Neural Network (TS-FNN). We also studied the PCM classification algorithm of input data of PTS-FNN model, the predecessor network of TS-FNN prediction model and the construction method of post-component network. Finally, the implementation process of PCM classification algorithm and TS-FNN prediction model were given. The R2R processing equipment health prediction experiment system was built and the PTS-FNN model experiment was carried out. The experimental results showed that the training time of PTS-FNN model was 50.37% less than the standard TS-FNN prediction model. The prediction accuracy increased by 5.48%, and the PTS-FNN had no error in the judgment of state 1 and state 4",PTS-FNN-Based Health Prediction Method for Flexible Photoelectric Film Material Processing Equipment,10.1155/2020/9232561,,'Hindawi Limited',"[{'title': 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering', 'identifiers': ['issn:1024-123X', '1024-123x', '1563-5147', 'issn:1563-5147']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
477989381,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls is one of most concerning accidents in aged population due to its high frequency and serious repercussion; thus, quick assistance is critical to avoid serious health consequences. There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement.This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program as part of the ACTIVAGE project under Grant 732679.Sarabia-Jácome, D.; Usach, R.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

The aim of the current review was to summarize current applications of 18F-FDOPA PET in gliomas and constitute, as a perspective, a first step in harmonizing clinical practices in French centers. In France, the indication for 18F-FDOPA PET is restricted to the assessment of primary brain tumor recurrence. According to the literature, this indication could be expanded to primary diagnosis and, to a lesser extent, treatment monitoring. There is a real need to harmonize standard procedures among French centers. The objective is to increase the availability of data for this rare entity of glioma and to develop multi-parametric PET analyses (static, dynamic and textural), also known as radiomics, by using artificial intelligence algorithms. For this purpose, kinetics analysis with dynamic PET acquisition should be implemented in routine practice because it has demonstrated its additional value for initial diagnosis in gliomas. Therefore, this review proposes a workflow based on acquisition and reconstruction parameters that can be implemented in each center to increase the amount of standardized 18F-FDOPA PET data in neuro-oncology imaging in France. This would help in creating a national database and developing national multi-center studies that can respond to the challenge of using multi-parametric PET in glioma",La TEP à la 18F-FDOPA dans les gliomes : applications actuelles et perspectives,10.1016/j.mednuc.2020.02.006,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
203885835,2/3/2014,"Prediction and classification techniques have been well studied by machine learning researchers and developed for several real-word problems. However, the level of acceptance and success of prediction models are still below expectation due to some difficulties such as the low performance of prediction models when they are applied in different environments. Such a problem has been addressed by many researchers, mainly from the machine learning community. A second problem, principally raised by model users in different communities, such as managers, economists, engineers, biologists, and medical practitioners, etc., is the prediction models’ interpretability. The latter is the ability of a model to explain its predictions and exhibit the causality relationships between the inputs and the outputs. In the case of classification, a successful way to alleviate the low performance is to use ensemble classiers. It is an intuitive strategy to activate collaboration between different classifiers towards a better performance than individual classier. Unfortunately, ensemble classifiers method do not take into account the interpretability of the final classification outcome. It even worsens the original interpretability of the individual classifiers. In this paper we propose a novel implementation of classifiers combination approach that does not only promote the overall performance but also preserves the interpretability of the resulting model. We propose a solution based on Ant Colony Optimization and tailored for the case of Bayesian classifiers. We validate our proposed solution with case studies from medical domain namely, heart disease and Cardiotography-based predictions, problems where interpretability is critical to make appropriate clinical decisions.",Public Library of Science,Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Interpretable Bayesian Classifiers Combination: Application to Medical Predictions,10.1371/journal.pone.0086456,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
80959251,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Mobile e-health applications provide users and healthcare practitioners with an insightful way to check users/patients’ status and monitor their daily calorie intake. Mobile e-health applications provide users and healthcare practitioners with an insightful way to check users/patients’ status and monitor their daily activities. This paper proposes a cloud-based mobile e-health calorie system that can classify food objects in the plate and further compute the overall calorie of each food object with high accuracy. The novelty in our system is that we are not only offloading heavy computational functions of the system to the cloud, but also employing an intelligent cloud-broker mechanism to strategically and efficiently utilize cloud instances to provide accurate and improved time response results. The broker system uses a dynamic cloud allocation mechanism that takes decisions on allocating and de-allocating cloud instances in real-time for ensuring the average response time stays within a predefined threshold.

Purpose: To compare different CEUS doses of injected contrast agent in order to establish an optimal dose for the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. Material and Methods: In Group A we compared the bolus dose of 1.2 mL vs. 2.4 mL and in Group B we compared the bolus dose of 2.4 mL vs. 4.8 mL (26 and 25 invasive carcinomas, respectively). CEUS was performed in real-time contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) using a L9-3 MHz probe. All examinations were recorded in a contrast side/side imaging mode loop for 120 s. Wash-in and wash-out patterns of the contrast agent were analyzed with advanced US quantification software and kinetic curves were used for statistical analysis. Results: In Group B (2.4 mL vs. 4.8 mL), more and stronger correlation was found among kinetic parameters (area under the curve, P< 0.00001; lognormal model parameters, mu, P = 0.0007 and sigma, P< 0.0001; mean transit time, P< 0.0001; model-based wash-out ratios, W-21m, P = 0.0002; W-50m, P = 0.0001; time-to-peak, P = 0.005) as compared to Group A (1.2 mL vs. 2.4 mL). Conclusion: The optimal way to evaluate kinetic features of invasive breast tumors using real-time CEUS is with an injection of contrast agent of either 2.4 mL or 4.8 mL",'SAGE Publications',Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using real-time contrast harmonic imaging in invasive breast cancer: comparison of enhancement dynamics with three different doses of contrast agent,10.1177/0284185114520860,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2).

attends to the user needs and increases their wellbeing. In this sense, this paper introduces the EJaCalIVE framework which allows
the creation of emotional virtual environments that incorporate agents, eHealth related devices, human actors, and emotions
projecting them virtually and managing the interaction between all the elements. In this way, the proposed framework allows
the design and programming of intelligent virtual environments, as well as the simulation and detection of human emotions which
can be used for the improvement of the decision-making processes of the developed entities. The paper also shows a case study
that enforces the need of this framework in common environments like nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Concretely, the
case study proposes the simulation of a residence for the elderly. The main goal is to have an emotion-based simulation to train an
assistance robot avoiding the complexity involved in working with the real elders. The main advantage of the proposed framework
is to provide a safe environment, that is, an environment where users are able to interact safely with the system.This work is partially supported by the MINECO/FEDER TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R and the FPI Grant AP2013-01276 awarded to Jaime-Andres Rincon.

Metodi: gli strumenti utilizzati sono quelli della pianificazione strategica e degli investimenti territoriali integrati, secondo una logica di intervento sulla struttura fisica della città coerente con la struttura demografica dei residenti e quindi capace di rispondere ai bisogni reali degli abitanti. I quartieri scelti per la sperimentazione sono “zone di margine” caratterizzati da una condizione di segregazione sociale e spaziale. Il modello di gestione è quello della medicina di iniziativa con intervento proattivo basato sulla partecipazione e coinvolgimento delle persone.

Risultati: i primi risultati mettono in evidenza che l’intervento messo in atto si presta particolarmente al coinvolgimento della popolazione anziana emarginata, che per presenza di barriere sociali, economiche, culturali ed ambientali, sottoutilizza o non si rivolge ai servizi di cura. Inoltre, alle azioni specifiche su target predefinito (ultra 70enni) vengono affiancate attività di promozione sociale del valore della salute e della cultura della responsabilità all’auto-cura individuale e collettiva.Objectives: the integration of health and social services is one of the most important issues for the municipal amministration of Cagliari which is building, restoration of functional abandoned buildings in neighborhoods with particular socio-economic problems to create Integrated Medical Information referred to as “health centers”, aimed particularly so for the elderly, but capable of having repercussions on the entire social structure of reference.

Methods: the instruments used are the strategic planning and investment territorial integrated, according to a logic of intervention on the physical structure of the city in line with the demographic structure of the residents and therefore able to respond to the real needs of the inhabitants. The districts chosen for testing are “marginal areas” characterized by a state of social and spatial segregation. The management model is one of medicine’s initiative with proactive intervention based on parteciapzione and involvement of people.

Results: the first results show that the intervention implemented is particularly the involvement of the elderly marginalized, that the presence of barriers to social, economic, and environmental culturalie, does not use care services.

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations.

The neural network (NN)-based data-driven method has been considered to be promising for MHC prediction due to the adaptability, nonlinearity and universal approximation capability of NNs. This paper presents an online MHC prediction approach using online dynamic fuzzy NNs (OD-FNNs) with structure and parameters learning. To meet the requirement of real-time application, the original OD-FNN is simplified based on an extreme learning machine technique as follows: (1) initial fuzzy rules are randomly generated without the knowledge of training data; (2) fuzzy rules are added and pruned uniformly by fired strength-based criteria; (3) antecedent parameters are fixed after generation so that only consequent parameters are updated online. The modified OD-FNN is particularly suitable for MHC prediction since: (1) fuzzy rules can evolve as new training datum arrives, which enables us to cope with non-stationary processes in MHC; (2) learning mechanisms applied are simple and efficient for real-time implementation. The validity and superiority of the proposed MHC prediction approach has been evaluated by real-world monitoring data from the accelerated bearing life.ASTAR (Agency for Sci., Tech. and Research, S’pore",'Elsevier BV',Machine health condition prediction via online dynamic fuzzy neural networks,10.1016/j.engappai.2014.05.015,,"[{'title': 'Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence', 'identifiers': ['issn:0952-1976', '0952-1976']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

161140829,2/3/2014,"Prediction and classification techniques have been well studied by machine learning researchers and developed for several real-word problems. However, the level of acceptance and success of prediction models are still below expectation due to some difficulties such as the low performance of prediction models when they are applied in different environments. Such a problem has been addressed by many researchers, mainly from the machine learning community. A second problem, principally raised by model users in different communities, such as managers, economists, engineers, biologists, and medical practitioners, etc., is the prediction models’ interpretability. The latter is the ability of a model to explain its predictions and exhibit the causality relationships between the inputs and the outputs. In the case of classification, a successful way to alleviate the low performance is to use ensemble classiers. It is an intuitive strategy to activate collaboration between different classifiers towards a better performance than individual classier. Unfortunately, ensemble classifiers method do not take into account the interpretability of the final classification outcome. It even worsens the original interpretability of the individual classifiers. In this paper we propose a novel implementation of classifiers combination approach that does not only promote the overall performance but also preserves the interpretability of the resulting model. We propose a solution based on Ant Colony Optimization and tailored for the case of Bayesian classifiers.

While preventable with proper food safety practices, the traditional restaurant inspection process has limited impact given the predictability and low frequency of inspections, and the dynamic nature of the kitchen environment. Despite this reality, the inspection process has remained largely unchanged for decades. CDC has even identified food safety as one of seven ”winnable battles”; however, progress to date has been limited.

We apply machine learning to Twitter data, develop a system that automatically detects venues likely to pose a public health hazard, and demonstrate its efficacy in the Las Vegas metropolitan area in a double-blind experiment conducted over three months in collaboration with Nevada’s health department. By contrast, previous research in this domain has been limited to indirect correlative validation using only aggregate statistics. We show that adaptive inspection process is 64 percent more effective at identifying problematic venues than the current state of the art. If fully deployed, our approach could prevent over 9,000 cases of foodborne illness and 557 hospitalizations annually in Las Vegas alone.

The deployment of this robot in healthcare sector has improved patient care and health. The vision system in a telepresence robot allows two way audiovisual communication between people at different location. In spite of such advancement, the manual way of controlling a robot to recognise and track people during an emergency is not favourable for a long duration. To circumvent this problem, biometric method using human face is proposed in this research which is implemented on Medical Telediagnosis Robot. This paper details the design of the face recognition and tracking system with four automated modules which are motion detection, face detection, face recognition and face tracking. The modules are developed with different algorithm and tested individually to ensure the stability of the system. Artificial Intelligence technique was applied at the face recognition stage while a two degree of freedom mechanism for actuator control was used at face tracking stage. A sequential mode operation is proposed to reduce the execution time in a real-time environment. To achieve this, only one module is operated at each time. A Graphical User Interface was developed to ease the users at the local and robot environment. The system is designed in LabVIEW platform. The biometric system proposed with hybrid algorithm at each module adapts for face images detected at different distances, poses and lighting condition.

IODA directly links a whole image to a whole label map, assigning a label to each pixel using a single neural network forward step. Instead of designing a handcrafted a priori model on labels (such as an atlas in the medical domain), we propose to automatically learn the dependencies between labels. The originality of IODA is to transpose DNN input pre-training trick to the output space, in order to learn a high level representation of labels. It allows a fast image labeling inside a fully neural network framework, without the need of any preprocessing such as feature designing or output coding.

202153885,2/28/2017,"AbstractA large part of the biomedical research spectrum is dedicated to develop electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing techniques to contribute to early diagnosis. However, it is common to find that ECG analysis methods reported are confined to off-line PC host operation. The authors present an arrhythmia classification method implemented on a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) platform intended for on-line, real-time ambulatory operation to classify eight heartbeat conditions: normal sinus rhythm (N), auricular fibrillation (AF), premature atrial contraction (PAC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinoauricular heart block (SHB) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The algorithm uses a wavelet transform process based on quadratic wavelets for identifying individual ECG waves and obtain a fiducial marker array. Classification is conducted by means of a Probabilistic Neural Network. The algorithm is tested with 17 ECG records obtained from the PhysioNet repository. The proposed classification procedure was tested initially on MATLAB and the results where compared with the equivalent analogue data fed to a DSP-based ECG data acquisition prototype through an arbitrary waveform generator. The results derived from confusion matrix tests yielded on-line classification accuracy of 92.69% (AF), 97.15% (N), 76.82% (PAC), 91.06% (LBBB), 87.5% (RBBB), 71.04% (PVC), 91.94% (SHB) and 95.45% (SVT), overall classification rate of 92.746% and 100% agreement between the MATLAB and on-line DSP implementations.

352137681,2014-03-21T00:00:00,"Future radiology practices assume that the radiology reports should be uniform, comprehensive, and easily managed. This means that reports must be readable to humans and machines alike. In order to improve reporting practices in breast imaging, we allow the radiologist to write structured reports with a special pen on paper with an invisible dot pattern. In this way, we provide a knowledge acquisition system for printed mammography patient forms for the combined work with printed and digital documents. In this domain, printed documents cannot be easily replaced by computer systems because they contain free-form sketches and textual annotations, and the acceptance of traditional PC reporting tools is rather low among the doctors. This is due to the fact that current electronic reporting systems significantly add to the amount of time it takes to complete the reports. We describe our real-time digital paper application and focus on the use case study of our deployed application. We think that our results motivate the design and implementation of intuitive pen-based user interfaces for the medical reporting process and similar knowledge work domains. Our system imposes only minimal overhead on traditional form-filling processes and provides for a direct, ontology-based structuring of the user input for semantic search and retrieval applications, as well as other applied artificial intelligence scenarios which involve manual form-based data acquisition",'Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)',Integrating Digital Pens in Breast Imaging for Instant Knowledge Acquisition,10.1609/aimag.v35i1.2501,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
323528435,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Стаття висвітлює проблеми розробки універсальних та адаптивних систем аналізу даних. На прикладі побудови біомедичних систем моніторингу стану здоров’я людини виділені основні принципи, притаманні системам, які аналізують мультимодальні дані. До основних невирішених проблем створення адаптивних систем можна віднести необхідність переконфігурації системи в залежності від вхідної задачі. Для розв’язання задач переконфігурації була запропонована архітектура адаптивної системи аналізу даних. Особливістю запропонованої системи є дворівнева архітектура: незалежна референсна система та підсистема, яка відповідає за адаптивну роботу.The development of adaptive system has been researched for a decade, but only recently machine learning problems became solvable. In this paper is presented an overview of current smart systems and the problem of development real adaptive and versatile data analysis system. Such system has to analyze multivariate signals of different nature. That is why the overview part is based on examples of biomedical human health monitoring systems (BHMS). BHMS have complex internal structure, to simplify it can be divided into three big tiers: tier of data acquisition, communication and analytics tiers. In the first tier, all data acquisition steps are made, including placement sensors to the specific location. The communication tier is responsible for gathering data from all available hardware and send it via wireless channel to the third layer. The analytical tier is the final destination of acquired data. This layer includes all algorithms which will be used for processing data and interpretation of the results. Such simple division allow us to specify and select our potential field of study and improvements. Specifically, in this paper the analytics tier will be explored and new system architecture will be proposed.
The crucial step in the adaptive systems development is solving reconfiguration problem. Nowadays, almost all data analysis systems have specific applicable fields. The main advantages of the latter are that they are robust, fast, but the development of such system can take a lot of time and reconfiguration of currently used systems will allow speed up that process. The reconfiguration is process of creation a specific targeting system from general system setup or currently known system. In this paper we have investigated problems, related with reconfiguration and proposing the theoretical basis for creation the reconfigurable adaptive system. The output structure is two-tier system, which allow to analyze any task from different field of study and then process it in a single setup. Each of the tier is considered as independent components, however the combination of the general reference system (tier one) and training agent subsystem (tier two) creates a highly adaptive system with reconfiguration properties. The reference system itself is a big storage of available algorithms which can be applied for certain problem and the algorithms workflow can be tuned for specific problem. Such adjustments can be made because of system training agent, which main purpose is to process input task and defined which algorithms can be applied. Such task classification problem can be solved by using machine learning algorithms.
Since, this paper presents only theoretical basis there is no precise implementation of proposed system. Currently we just gave a small overview of the future development of adaptive and reconfigurable systems.В данной работе были исследованы проблемы разработки универсальных и адаптивных систем анализа данных.

33499577,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"There is an increasing need in biology and clinical medicine to robustly and reliably measure tens-to-hundreds of peptides and proteins in clinical and biological samples with high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and repeatability. Previously, we demonstrated that LC-MRM-MS with isotope dilution has suitable performance for quantitative measurements of small numbers of relatively abundant proteins in human plasma, and that the resulting assays can be transferred across laboratories while maintaining high reproducibility and quantitative precision. Here we significantly extend that earlier work, demonstrating that 11 laboratories using 14 LC-MS systems can develop, determine analytical figures of merit, and apply highly multiplexed MRM-MS assays targeting 125 peptides derived from 27 cancer-relevant proteins and 7 control proteins to precisely and reproducibly measure the analytes in human plasma. To ensure consistent generation of high quality data we incorporated a system suitability protocol (SSP) into our experimental design. The SSP enabled real-time monitoring of LC-MRM-MS performance during assay development and implementation, facilitating early detection and correction of chromatographic and instrumental problems. Low to sub-nanogram/mL sensitivity for proteins in plasma was achieved by one-step immunoaffinity depletion of 14 abundant plasma proteins prior to analysis. Median intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was <20%, sufficient for most biological studies and candidate protein biomarker verification. Digestion recovery of peptides was assessed and quantitative accuracy improved using heavy isotope labeled versions of the proteins as internal standards. Using the highly multiplexed assay, participating laboratories were able to precisely and reproducibly determine the levels of a series of analytes in blinded samples used to simulate an inter-laboratory clinical study of patient samples. Our study further establishes that LC-MRM-MS using stable isotope dilution, with appropriate attention to analytical validation and appropriate quality c`ontrol measures, enables sensitive, specific, reproducible and quantitative measurements of proteins and peptides in complex biological matrices such as plasma",'American Society for Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (ASBMB)',"Large-scale inter-laboratory study to develop, analytically validate and apply highly multiplexed, quantitative peptide assays to measure cancer-relevant proteins in plasma",10.1074/mcp.M114.047050,https://core.ac.uk/download/33499577.pdf,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
163105483,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",'Elsevier BV',Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,https://core.ac.uk/download/163105483.pdf,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

74320701,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"The increasing application of process-oriented approaches in new challenging dynamic domains beyond business computing (e.g., healthcare, emergency management, factories of the future, home automation, etc.) has led to reconsider the level of flexibility and support required to manage complex knowledge-intensive processes in such domains. A knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making and coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves performing complex tasks in the “physical” real world to achieve a common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable, and knowledge-intensive processes must be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue. To tackle this issue, in this paper we present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process Management System featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated adaptation of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able to automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions occur, without explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions and without the intervention of domain experts at runtime, aiming at reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc changes, and thus at relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish this, we make use of well-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. The approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been implemented and validated with a case study based on real knowledge-intensive processes coming from an emergency management domain",'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',Intelligent Process Adaptation in the SmartPM System,10.1145/2948071,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The immunodevice is based on chemisorption of open tissue transglutaminase enzyme on the surface of gold nanoparticles-functionalized carbon screen printed electrodes. IgA and IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase target antibodies are recognized by the immobilized bioreceptor as highly specific biomarkers related to Celiac Disease.

Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows  to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample.

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2).

189855542,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",'Elsevier BV',Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To this end an iterative selection procedure employing the Tomlinson I phage display library and a crude almond protein extract was carried out. Two different almond-specific scFv (named PD1F6 and PD2C9) were isolated after two rounds of biopanning, and an indirect phage ELISA was implemented to detect the presence of almond protein in foodstuffs. The isolated scFvs demonstrated to be highly specific and allowed detection of 40 ng mL?1 and 100 ng mL?1 of raw and roasted almond protein, respectively. The practical detection limit of the assay in almond spiked food products was 0.1 mg g?1 (110e120 ppm). The developed indirect phage ELISA was validated by analysis of 92 commercial food products, showing good correlation with the results obtained by a previously developed real-time PCR method for the detection of almond in foodstuffs.

detecting invariant points using only textures that are present in the sclera, i.e., without using traditional
features like the pupil and/or cornea reflections, which remain partially or totally occluded in most
surgeries. Two known algorithms that compute invariant points and correspondences between pairs of
images were implemented in our system: Scalable Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) and Speed Up
Robust Features (SURF). The results of experiments performed on phantom eyes show that, with either
algorithm, the developed system tracks a sphere at a 360◦ rotation angle with an error that is lower than
0.5%. Some experiments have also been carried out on images of real eyes showing promising behavior

146965571,2015-09,"There is an increasing need in biology and clinical medicine to robustly and reliably measure tens-to-hundreds of peptides and proteins in clinical and biological samples with high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and repeatability. Previously, we demonstrated that LC-MRM-MS with isotope dilution has suitable performance for quantitative measurements of small numbers of relatively abundant proteins in human plasma, and that the resulting assays can be transferred across laboratories while maintaining high reproducibility and quantitative precision. Here we significantly extend that earlier work, demonstrating that 11 laboratories using 14 LC-MS systems can develop, determine analytical figures of merit, and apply highly multiplexed MRM-MS assays targeting 125 peptides derived from 27 cancer-relevant proteins and 7 control proteins to precisely and reproducibly measure the analytes in human plasma. To ensure consistent generation of high quality data we incorporated a system suitability protocol (SSP) into our experimental design. The SSP enabled real-time monitoring of LC-MRM-MS performance during assay development and implementation, facilitating early detection and correction of chromatographic and instrumental problems. Low to sub-nanogram/mL sensitivity for proteins in plasma was achieved by one-step immunoaffinity depletion of 14 abundant plasma proteins prior to analysis. Median intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was <20%, sufficient for most biological studies and candidate protein biomarker verification. Digestion recovery of peptides was assessed and quantitative accuracy improved using heavy isotope labeled versions of the proteins as internal standards. Using the highly multiplexed assay, participating laboratories were able to precisely and reproducibly determine the levels of a series of analytes in blinded samples used to simulate an inter-laboratory clinical study of patient samples. Our study further establishes that LC-MRM-MS using stable isotope dilution, with appropriate attention to analytical validation and appropriate quality c`ontrol measures, enables sensitive, specific, reproducible and quantitative measurements of proteins and peptides in complex biological matrices such as plasma","American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","Large-scale interlaboratory study to develop, analytically validate and apply highly multiplexed, quantitative peptide assays to measure cancer-relevant proteins in plasma",10.1074/mcp.M114.047050,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

251203367,2018-10-11T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Logistic regression is a popular technique used in machine learning to construct classification models. Since the construction of such models is based on computing with large datasets, it is an appealing idea to outsource this computation to a cloud service. The privacy-sensitive nature of the input data requires appropriate privacy preserving measures before outsourcing it. Homomorphic encryption enables one to compute on encrypted data directly, without decryption and can be used to mitigate the privacy concerns raised by using a cloud service. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an algorithm (and its implementation) to train a logistic regression model on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. The core of our algorithm consists of a new iterative method that can be seen as a simplified form of the fixed Hessian method, but with a much lower multiplicative complexity. RESULTS: We test the new method on two interesting real life applications: the first application is in medicine and constructs a model to predict the probability for a patient to have cancer, given genomic data as input; the second application is in finance and the model predicts the probability of a credit card transaction to be fraudulent. The method produces accurate results for both applications, comparable to running standard algorithms on plaintext data. CONCLUSIONS: This article introduces a new simple iterative algorithm to train a logistic regression model that is tailored to be applied on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. This algorithm can be used as a privacy-preserving technique to build a binary classification model and can be applied in a wide range of problems that can be modelled with logistic regression. Our implementation results show that our method can handle the large datasets used in logistic regression training.status: publishe",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Privacy-preserving logistic regression training,10.1186/s12920-018-0398-y,,"[{'title': 'BMC Medical Genomics', 'identifiers': ['1755-8794', 'issn:1755-8794']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
143643223,2018-02-01T00:00:00,"Objective: To train a generic deep learning software (DLS) to classify breast cancer on ultrasound images and to compare its performance to human readers with variable breast imaging experience.

Methods: In this retrospective study, all breast ultrasound examinations from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 at our institution were reviewed. Patients with post-surgical scars, initially indeterminate, or malignant lesions with histological diagnoses or 2-year follow-up were included. The DLS was trained with 70% of the images, and the remaining 30% were used to validate the performance. Three readers with variable expertise also evaluated the validation set (radiologist, resident, medical student). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with a receiver operating characteristic analysis.

Results: 82 patients with malignant and 550 with benign lesions were included. Time needed for training was 7 min (DLS). Evaluation time for the test data set were 3.7 s (DLS) and 28, 22 and 25 min for human readers (decreasing experience). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed non-significant differences (p-values 0.45–0.47) in the area under the curve of 0.84 (DLS), 0.88 (experienced and intermediate readers) and 0.79 (inexperienced reader).

Conclusion: DLS may aid diagnosing cancer on breast ultrasound images with an accuracy comparable to radiologists, and learns better and faster than a human reader with no prior experience. Further clinical trials with dedicated algorithms are warranted.

Advances in knowledge: DLS can be trained classify cancer on breast ultrasound images high accuracy even with comparably few training cases.

82487224,8/31/2014,"AbstractBovine mastitis is a frequent problem in Swiss dairy herds. One of the main pathogens causing significant economic loss is Staphylococcus aureus. Various Staph. aureus genotypes with different biological properties have been described. Genotype B (GTB) of Staph. aureus was identified as the most contagious and one of the most prevalent strains in Switzerland. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with the herd-level presence of Staph. aureus GTB and Staph. aureus non-GTB in Swiss dairy herds with an elevated yield-corrected herd somatic cell count (YCHSCC). One hundred dairy herds with a mean YCHSCC between 200,000 and 300,000cells/mL in 2010 were recruited and each farm was visited once during milking. A standardized protocol investigating demography, mastitis management, cow husbandry, milking system, and milking routine was completed during the visit. A bulk tank milk (BTM) sample was analyzed by real-time PCR for the presence of Staph. aureus GTB to classify the herds into 2 groups: Staph. aureus GTB-positive and Staph. aureus GTB-negative. Moreover, quarter milk samples were aseptically collected for bacteriological culture from cows with a somatic cell count ≥150,000cells/mL on the last test-day before the visit. The culture results allowed us to allocate the Staph. aureus GTB-negative farms to Staph. aureus non-GTB and Staph. aureus-free groups. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with the herd-level presence of Staph. aureus GTB and Staph. aureus non-GTB. The prevalence of Staph. aureus GTB herds was 16% (n=16), whereas that of Staph. aureus non-GTB herds was 38% (n=38). Herds that sent lactating cows to seasonal communal pastures had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (odds ratio: 10.2, 95% CI: 1.9–56.6), compared with herds without communal pasturing. Herds that purchased heifers had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (rather than Staph. aureus non-GTB) compared with herds without purchase of heifers. Furthermore, herds that did not use udder ointment as supportive therapy for acute mastitis had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (odds ratio: 8.5, 95% CI: 1.6–58.4) or Staph. aureus non-GTB (odds ratio: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.3–27.8) than herds that used udder ointment occasionally or regularly. Herds in which the milker performed unrelated activities during milking had significantly higher odds of being infected with Staph. aureus GTB (rather than Staph. aureus non-GTB) compared with herds in which the milker did not perform unrelated activities at milking.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

In a general form, those mechanisms occur across multiple scales, both spatial and temporal, and contain linear and non-linear information. In this framework, entropy measures are good candidates in order provide useful evidence about disorder in the system, lack of information in time-series and/or irregularity of the signals. The most common movement disorder is essential tremor (ET), which occurs 20 times more than Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, about 50%-70% of the cases of ET have a genetic origin. One of the most used standard tests for clinical diagnosis of ET is Archimedes' spiral drawing. This work focuses on the selection of non-linear biomarkers from such drawings and handwriting, and it is part of a wider cross study on the diagnosis of essential tremor, where our piece of research presents the selection of entropy features for early ET diagnosis. Classic entropy features are compared with features based on permutation entropy.

However, it is common to find that ECG analysis methods reported are confined to off-line PC host operation. The authors present an arrhythmia classification method implemented on a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) platform intended for on-line, real-time ambulatory operation to classify eight heartbeat conditions: normal sinus rhythm (N), auricular fibrillation (AF), premature atrial contraction (PAC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinoauricular heart block (SHB) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The algorithm uses a wavelet transform process based on quadratic wavelets for identifying individual ECG waves and obtain a fiducial marker array. Classification is conducted by means of a Probabilistic Neural Network. The algorithm is tested with 17 ECG records obtained from the PhysioNet repository. The proposed classification procedure was tested initially on MATLAB and the results where compared with the equivalent analogue data fed to a DSP-based ECG data acquisition prototype through an arbitrary waveform generator. The results derived from confusion matrix tests yielded on-line classification accuracy of 92.69% (AF), 97.15% (N), 76.82% (PAC), 91.06% (LBBB), 87.5% (RBBB), 71.04% (PVC), 91.94% (SHB) and 95.45% (SVT), overall classification rate of 92.746% and 100% agreement between the MATLAB and on-line DSP implementations.

201850402,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties including repetitive patterns of behavior known as stereotypical motor movements (SMM). So far, several techniques have been implemented to track and identify SMMs. In this context, we propose a deep learning approach for SMM recognition, namely, convolutional neural networks (CNN) in time and frequency-domains. To solve the intrasubject SMM variability, we propose a robust CNN model for SMM detection within subjects, whose parameters are set according to a proper analysis of SMM signals, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art SMM classification works. And, to solve the intersubject variability, we propose a global, fast, and light-weight framework for SMM detection across subjects which combines a knowledge transfer technique with an SVM classifier, therefore resolving the “real-life” medical issue associated with the lack of supervised SMMs per testing subject in particular. We further show that applying transfer learning across domains instead of transfer learning within the same domain also generalizes to the SMM target domain, thus alleviating the problem of the lack of supervised SMMs in general",'Hindawi Limited',A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Recognizing Stereotypical Motor Movements within and across Subjects on the Autism Spectrum Disorder,10.1155/2018/7186762,,"[{'title': 'Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience', 'identifiers': ['issn:1687-5273', '1687-5273', '1687-5265', 'issn:1687-5265']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
227981804,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: It has been revealed that Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) may feature anti-cancer and anti-metastatic advantages due to its ability to modify cell immunity processes and signaling pathways. Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive human cancers; it has a high mortality nature, which makes it an attractive area for the development of novel therapies. Objectives: We examined whether the SEB could exert its growth inhibitory effects on glioblastoma cells partially through the manipulation of a key tumor growth factor termed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²). Materials and Methods: A human primary glioblastoma cell line, U87, was treated with different concentrations of SEB. The cell quantity was measured by the MTT assay at different exposure times. For molecular assessments, total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from either non-treated or SEB-treated cells. Subsequently, the gene expression of TGF-Î² transducers, smad2/3, at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, was analyzed via a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the SYBR Green method. Significant differences between cell viability and gene expression levels were determined (Prism 5.0 software) using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Results: We reported that SEB could effectively down-regulate smad2/3 expression in glioblastoma cells at concentrations as quantity as 1 Âµg/mL and 2 Âµg/mL (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The SEB concentrations effective at regulating smad2/3 expression were correlated with those used to inhibit the proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Our results also showed that SEB was able to decrease smad2/3 expression at the mRNA level in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Conclusions: We suggested that SEB could represent an agent that can significantly decrease smad2/3 expression in glioblastoma cells, leading to moderate TGF-Î² growth signaling and the reduction of tumor cell proliferation.

304881195,2015,"Aquéllos que practican cualquier deporte, ya sea con objetivos competitivos o de salud, al tratar de mantener su condición física, se encuentran en un nivel que les permite ser útiles y al mismo tiempo prevenir sucesos traumáticos (Scotton et al 2006; Viru 2002). El atleta que compite, amateur o profesional, debe seguir estrictamente la periodización (Scotton, Gollin 2006) y el programa más adecuado para sus propósitos, privilegiando los medios y métodos de entrenamiento más afines y útiles para la formación durante el período especificado. Se sabe que al acercarse una carrera, el tipo de entrenamiento seguido se parece cada vez más a la competición. Se trata de un hábito establecido para aquéllos que realizan cualquier actividad deportiva (Scotton 2003) con fines competitivos, tratar de mantener la eficiencia en el sistema músculo-esquelético y los sistemas conectados a él (Wilmore, Costill 2005), para obtener diversión y, de paso, condición física, sin considerar demasiado las reglas que regulan la formación deportiva. Un sujeto no profesional que usa el monitor de frecuencia cardíaca Polar S710i ha realizado dos sesiones de entrenamiento en una bicicleta de montaña de recorrido libre en dos días separados y en la misma ruta. El software del instrumento permite superponer los archivos del mismo para resaltar las similitudes de las secciones principales de las sesiones: duración de ascenso y descenso con la velocidad obtenida y los kilómetros recorridos, la frecuencia cardíaca media y máxima para las fracciones individuales, y el entrenamiento total. Objetivo: En este trabajo se propone usar los datos recogidos en un recorrido ""real"" para permitir que el atleta pueda replicarlos en casa o en el gimnasio, manteniendo los ritmos cardíacos durante el tiempo indicado mediante la combinación del uso de rodillos, sobre los que se coloca la bicicleta, y el uso del monitor de frecuencia cardíaca (Wirnitzer, Kornexl 2008).Who practice sports, whether with competitive or health objectives, while trying to maintain their physical condition, are at a level that allows them to be useful and at the same time prevent traumatic events (Scotton et al 2006; Viru 2002). The athlete who competes, amateur or professional, must strictly follow the periodization (Scotton, Gollin 2006) and the most suitable program for his purposes, privileging the most compatible and useful means and training methods during the specified period. It is known that when a race is approaching, the type of training followed looks more and more like competition. It is a habit established for those who practice any sports activity (Scotton 2003) for competitive purposes, trying to maintain efficiency in the musculoskeletal system and the systems connected to it (Wilmore, Costill 2005), to get fun and, in passing, physical condition, without considering too much the rules that regulate sports training. A non-professional subject using the Polar S710i heart rate monitor has performed two training sessions on a free-riding mountain bike on two separate days and on the same route. The software of the instrument allows superimposing the files of the same to highlight the similarities of the main sections of the sessions: duration of ascent and descent with the speed obtained and the kilometers traveled, the average and maximum heart rates for the individual fractions, and the training total. Objective: In this work we propose to use the data collected in a ""real"" route to allow the athlete to replicate them at home or in the gym, maintaining the heart rhythms during the indicated time by combining the use of rollers, on which the bicycle is placed, and the use of the heart rate monitor is used (Wirnitzer, Kornexl 2008).Chi pratica sport, sia con obiettivi agonistici sia di fitness, cerca di mantenere il proprio stato di forma ad un livello che gli permetta di essere prestativo e contemporaneamente di prevenire eventi traumatici (Scotton et al. 2006; Viru 2002). L’atleta che compete, amatore o professionista, dovrebbe seguire scrupolosamente la periodizzazione (Scotton, Gollin 2006) e la programmazione più idonee ai propri scopi, privilegiando i mezzi e i metodi di allenamento più congeniali a lui e più utili per lo specifico periodo. E’ noto che quando si avvicinano le gare il tipo di allenamento seguito assomiglia sempre più alla tipologia di competizione. E’ abitudine consolidata per chi svolge una qualsiasi specialità sportiva (Scotton 2003) con finalità non agonistiche cercare di mantenere efficiente l’apparato locomotore ed i sistemi ad esso collegati (Wilmore, Costill 2005) per ottenere divertimento e, appunto, il fitness, senza considerare troppo le norme che regolano l’allenamento sportivo. Un soggetto, non professionista, indossando il cardiofrequenzimetro Polar S710i ha effettuato due sessioni di allenamento su una mountain bike da free-ride in due distinte giornate e sullo stesso percorso. Il software dello strumento consente di sovrapporre i files del medesimo giro evidenziando le somiglianze dei tratti principali delle sedute: la durata della salita e della discesa con le velocità ottenute e i km percorsi, le frequenze cardiache medie e massime relative alle singole frazioni dell’allenamento e nel totale. Obiettivo: Nel lavoro si propone di utilizzare i dati raccolti sul percorso “reale” per permettere all’atleta di replicarlo a casa o in palestra mantenendo le frequenze cardiache per il tempo indicato abbinando all’uso dei rulli, su cui è posizionata la bicicletta, anche l’impiego del cardiofrequenzimetro (Wirnitzer, Kornexl 2008).peerReviewe",Federación Extremeña de Balonmano y Universidad de Extremadura,"Mountain bike, monitoring and heart rate monitor",,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1885-7019', '1885-7019']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is high demand for tracking running performance and progress for amateurs and professionals alike. The parameters velocity and distance are thereby of main interest. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of four algorithms, which calculate the stride velocity and stride length during running using data of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed in the midsole of a running shoe. The four algorithms are based on stride time, foot acceleration, foot trajectory estimation, and deep learning, respectively. They are compared using two studies: a laboratory-based study comprising 2377 strides from 27 subjects with 3D motion tracking as a reference and a field study comprising 12 subjects performing a 3.2-km run in a real-world setup. The results show that the foot trajectory estimation algorithm performs best, achieving a mean error of 0.032 ± 0.274 m/s for the velocity estimation and 0.022 ± 0.157 m for the stride length. An interesting alternative for systems with a low energy budget is the acceleration-based approach. Our results support the implementation decision for running velocity and distance tracking using IMUs embedded in the sole of a running shoe",'MDPI AG',Comparison of Different Algorithms for Calculating Velocity and Stride Length in Running Using Inertial Measurement Units,10.3390/s18124194,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2). Video detection of cells at 105, 104, 103, and 100 cells/mL is demonstrated in real time using un-reconstructed holograms.

Emissions reduction and the achievement of the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol are becoming a fundamental concern in the work of engineers and technicians operating in the energy management field. Optimal energy management practices need to deal with uncertainties in generation and demand, hence the development of reliable forecasting methods is an important priority area of research in electric energy systems. This paper presents a load forecasting model and the way it was applied to a real case study, to forecast the electrical consumption of the Cellini medical clinic of Turin. The model can be easily integrated into a Building Management System or into a real time monitoring system. The load forecasting is performed through the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed multi-layer perceptron ANN, based on a back propagation training algorithm, is able to take as inputs: loads, data concerning the type of day (e.g. weekday/holiday), time of the day and weather data.

Available from BMJ Publishing Group via the DOI in this record.Objective Bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with adverse human health outcomes and exposure to this compound is near-ubiquitous in the Western world. We aimed to examine whether self-moderation of BPA exposure is possible by altering diet in a real-world setting.

Design An Engaged Research dietary intervention study designed, implemented and analysed by healthy teenagers from six schools and undertaken in their own homes.

Participants A total of 94 students aged between 17 and 19 years from schools in the South West of the UK provided diet diaries and urine samples for analysis.

Intervention Researcher participants designed a set of literature-informed guidelines for the reduction of dietary BPA to be followed for 7 days.

Main outcome measures Creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA levels were taken before and after the intervention. Information on packaging and food/drink ingested was used to calculate a BPA risk score for anticipated exposure. A qualitative analysis was carried out to identify themes addressing long-term sustainability of the diet.

Results BPA was detected in urine of 86% of participants at baseline at a median value of 1.22 ng/mL (IQR 1.99). No effect of the intervention diet on BPA levels was identified overall (P=0.25), but there was a positive association in those participants who showed a drop in urinary BPA concentration postintervention and their initial BPA level (P=0.003). Qualitative analysis identified themes around feelings of lifestyle restriction and the inadequacy of current labelling practices.

Conclusions We found no evidence in this self-administered intervention study that it was possible to moderate BPA exposure by diet in a real-world setting. Furthermore, our study participants indicated that they would be unlikely to sustain such a diet long term, due to the difficulty in identifying BPA-free foods.This study was funded by a Wellcome Trust People Award to LWH and TSG (grant no 105162/Z/14/Z).

81924539,12/31/2016,"AbstractDetection and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are critically linked to the diagnosis abnormalities. Any abnormality in the wave shape and duration of the wave features of the ECG is considered as arrhythmia. This paper presents a diagnostic system for classification of cardiac arrhythmia from ECG data, using hybrid model of Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic. In an ECG, clinically useful information is obtained from the intervals and amplitudes of the cardiac waves. In an ECG, the non-stationary signal commonly changed its statistical property with time. In the proposed paper an algorithm based on wavelet packet tree classifier (for detection of QRS complex) has been implemented for the comparative study of automatic real-time ECG data. The amplitude and duration of the characteristic waves of the ECG can be more accurately obtained using Wavelet Packet Tree (WPT) analysis. WPT techniques have been employed to extract a set of linear (time and frequency domain) characteristics. Neuro-fuzzy techniques have been employed to extract a set of non-linear characteristic features from the transformed ECG signals. The real-time signals are obtained from various diagnostic centers.

275626014,2017-04-01T00:00:00,"Progress in biomechanical modelling of human soft tissue is the basis for the development of new clinical applications capable of improving the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases (e.g. cancer), as well as the surgical planning and guidance of some interventions. The finite element method (FEM) is one of the most popular techniques used to predict the deformation of the human soft tissue due to its high accuracy. However, FEM has an associated high computational cost, which makes it difficult its integration in real-time computer-aided surgery systems. An alternative for simulating the mechanical behaviour of human organs in real time comes from the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, which are much faster than FEM. This paper assesses the feasibility of ML methods for modelling the biomechanical behaviour of the human liver during the breathing process, which is crucial for guiding surgeons during interventions where it is critical to track this deformation (e.g. some specific kind of biopsies) or for the accurate application of radiotherapy dose to liver tumours. For this purpose, different ML regression models were investigated, including three tree-based methods (decision trees, random forests and extremely randomised trees) and other two simpler regression techniques (dummy model and linear regression). In order to build and validate the ML models, a labelled data set was constructed from modelling the deformation of eight ex-vivo human livers using FEM. The best prediction performance was obtained using extremely randomised trees, with a mean error of 0.07 mm and all the samples with an error under 1 mm. The achieved results lay the foundation for the future development of some real-time software capable of simulating the human liver deformation during the breathing process during clinical interventions.This work has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) through research projects TIN2014-52033-R and DPI2013-40859-R, both also supported by European FEDER funds.

In a general form, those mechanisms occur across multiple scales, both spatial and temporal, and contain linear and non-linear information. In this framework, entropy measures are good candidates in order provide useful evidence about disorder in the system, lack of information in time-series and/or irregularity of the signals. The most common movement disorder is essential tremor (ET), which occurs 20 times more than Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, about 50%-70% of the cases of ET have a genetic origin. One of the most used standard tests for clinical diagnosis of ET is Archimedes' spiral drawing. This work focuses on the selection of non-linear biomarkers from such drawings and handwriting, and it is part of a wider cross study on the diagnosis of essential tremor, where our piece of research presents the selection of entropy features for early ET diagnosis. Classic entropy features are compared with features based on permutation entropy. Automatic analysis system settled on several Machine Learning paradigms is performed, while automatic features selection is implemented by means of ANOVA (analysis of variance) test.

Optimization of the energy consumption of mobile applications, especially those which run 24/7 in the background, is essential for longer use of smartphones. In order to improve energy-efficiency without compromising on the fall detection performance, we propose a novel 3-tier architecture that combines simple thresholding methods with machine learning algorithms. The proposed method is implemented on a mobile application, called uSurvive, for Android smartphones. It runs as a background service and monitors the activities of a person in daily life and automatically sends a notification to the appropriate authorities and/or user defined contacts when it detects a fall. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated in terms of fall detection performance and energy consumption. Real life performance tests conducted on two different models of smartphone demonstrate that our 3-tier architecture with feature reduction could save up to 62% of energy compared to machine learning only solutions.

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations.

211485892,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The twelve papers included in this special issue represent a selection of extended contributions presented at the Sixth International Conference on Soft Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications, held in Salamanca, Spain, 6–8th April, 2011. Papers were selected on the basis of fundamental ideas and concepts rather than the direct usage of well-established techniques. This special issue is then aimed at practitioners, researchers and post-graduate students, who are engaged in developing and applying advanced Soft Computing Models to solving real-world problems in the Industrial and Environmental fields. The papers are organized as follows. In the first contribution, Graña and Gonzalez-Acuña develop a formulation of dendritic classifiers based on lattice kernels and train them using a direct Monte Carlo approach and a Sparse Bayesian Learning. The results of both kinds of training are compared with the Relevance Vector Machines on a collection of benchmark datasets. In the second contribution by Irigoyen and Miñano, the authors present the results of the identification of the relationship in time, between the required exercise (machine resistance) and the heart rate of the patient in medical effort tests, using a NARX neural network model. In the experimental stage, test data have been obtained by exercising with a cyclo-ergometer in two different tests: Power Step Response and Conconi. Carneiro et al. in the third contribution present a biologically inspired method to deal with the problem in which genetic algorithms are used to create possible solutions for a given dispute. The approach presented is able to generate a broad number of diverse solutions that cover virtually the whole search space for a given problem. The results of this work are being applied in a negotiation tool that is part of the UMCourt conflict resolution platform. In the fourth contribution by Donate et al., they propose a novel Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) approach, where a weighted n-fold validation fitness scheme is used to build an ensemble of neural networks, under four different combination methods: mean, median, softmax and rank-based combinations. Several experiments were held, using six real-world time series with different characteristics and from distinct domains. Overall, the proposed approach achieved competitive results when compared with non weighted n-fold EANN ensembles, the simpler 0-fold EANN and also the popular Holt–Winters statistical method. Dan Burdescu et al. in the fifth contribution, present a system used in the medical domain for three distinct tasks: image annotation, semantic based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. An original image segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure was used to perform the segmentation of medical images. Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The annotation and semantic based retrieval task is evaluated for two annotation models: Cross Media Relevance Model and Continuous-space Relevance Model. Semantic based image retrieval is performed using the methods provided by the annotation models. The ontology used by the annotation process was created in an original manner starting from the information content provided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The experiments were made using a database containing colour images retrieved from medical domain using an endoscope and related to digestive diseases. In sixth paper by Pedraza et al., they develop a face recognition system based on soft computing techniques, which complies with privacy-by-design rules and defines a set of principles that context-aware applications (including biometric sensors) should contain to conform to European and US law. This research deals with the necessity to consider legal issues concerning privacy or human rights in the development of biometric identification in ambient intelligence systems. Clearly, context-based services and ambient intelligence (and the most promising research area in Europe, namely ambient assisted living, ALL) call for a major research effort on new identification procedures. The aim of the research by Redel-Macías et al. in paper seven is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem. In the eighth paper, Wu et al. analyse the existence criterion of loop strategies, and then present some corollaries and theorems, by which the loop strategies and chain strategies can be found, also superfluous strategies and inconsistent strategies. It presents a ranking model that indicates the weak node in strategy set and it also introduces a probability-based model which is the basis of evaluation of strategy. Additionally, this research proposes a method to generate offensive strategy, and the statistic results of simulation game prove the validity of the method. Pop et al. in the ninth paper present an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a local–global approach to the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) and a powerful local search procedure. The computational experiments on several benchmarks instances show that the hybrid algorithm is competitive to all of the known heuristics published to date. In the tenth paper Kramer et al. illustrate how methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting, and monitoring techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable, and smart energy grids. The study is based on the application of kernel methods like support vector regression and kernel density estimation as prediction methods. Furthermore, dimension reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of high-dimensional wind time series are applied. The methods are briefly introduced, related work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The experimental parts are based on real wind energy time series data from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Vera et al. in the eleventh contribution present a novel soft computing procedure based on the application of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and identification systems, which makes it possible to optimise the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving both time and financial costs and/or energy. The novel proposed approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. The final contribution, by Sakalauskas and Kriksciuniene, presents a research about financial market efficiency and to recognize major reversal points of long-term trend of stock market index, which could indicate forthcoming crisis or market raise periods. The study suggests a computational model of financial time series analysis, which combines several approaches of soft computing, including information efficiency evaluation methods (Shannon's entropy, Hurst exponent), neural networks and sensitivity analysis. The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behaviour, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index. The performance of neural network model is explored by applying sensitivity analysis and resulted in selecting smoothing parameters of the input variables. The experimental research investigates behaviour of the long-term trend of the three emerging financial markets within NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchange. Introduction of information efficiency measures improve ability of the model to recognize the approaching reversal of long-term trend from temporary market “nervousness” and can be useful for calibrating stock trading strategy.

296224748,2017-06,"Over the last decade, toxic events along the Mediterranean coast associated with exceptional harmful blooms of the dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata have increased in frequency and distribution, causing not only the death of marine organisms and human health problems, but also economic loss on the tourism and aquaculture industries. In order to reduce the burden of routine algal counting, an innovative automated, low-cost, opto-electronic system called OvMeter was developed. It is able to speed up the monitoring process and therefore it enables early warning of incipient harmful algal blooms. An ad-hoc software tool provides automated cell recognition, counting and real-time calculation of the final algal concentration. The core of dinoflagellate recognition relies on a localization step which takes advantage of the synergistic exploitation of 2D bright-field and quantitative phase microscopy images, and a classification phase performed by a machine learning algorithm based on Boosted Trees approach. The architectural design of the OvMeter device is presented here, together with a performance evaluation on sea samples",Springer,OvMeter: an automated 3D-integrated opto-electronic system for Ostreopsis cf. ovata bloom monitoring,10.1007/s10811-017-1069-7,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

82405452,12/31/2013,"AbstractObjectivesThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of free circulating DNA (FCDNA) as a biomarker in patients suffering from colorectal cancer (CRC), investigating both its prognostic value correlated with stage of disease and its potential role in early recurrence diagnosis.MethodsThe quantification of plasma DNA was achieved through the use of real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the RNAse P gene. The study enrolled patients undergoing surgery for primary CRC, at different stages of disease; samples were collected before surgery and during follow-up examinations every 3 months after surgery. Data were statistically analyzed using Software Packages SPSS® for Windows.ResultsFCDNA was detectable in all pre-operative samples and the mean value was 47.8 ng/mL. FCDNA values increased progressively related to UICC stage of disease, although statistical significance was demonstrated only when comparing patients by pT stage. The analysis of postoperative samples showed a significant decrease of FCDNA quantity after radical surgery and in specific cases a rise preceding disease recurrence.ConclusionsThis study shows that absolute quantification of FCDNA in CRC patients could have a prognostic value, being related to stage of disease, and could be used as potential tool for early detection of recurrences",Elsevier Ltd and Surgical Associates Ltd.,Free circulating DNA as a biomarker of colorectal cancer ,10.1016/S1743-9191(13)60017-5,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82405452.pdf,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
98663631,2016,"The increasing application of process-oriented approaches in new challenging dynamic domains beyond business computing (e.g., healthcare, emergency management, factories of the future, home automation, etc.) has led to reconsider the level of flexibility and support required to manage complex knowledge-intensive processes in such domains. A knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making and coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves performing complex tasks in the &quot;physical&quot; real world to achieve a common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable, and knowledgeintensive processes must be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue. To tackle this issue, in this paper we present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process Management System featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated adaptation of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able to automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions occur, without explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions and without the intervention of domain experts at runtime, aiming at reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc changes, and thus at relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish this, we make use of we ll-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. The approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been implemented and validated with a case study based on real knowledgeintensive processes coming from an emergency management domain",Association for Computer Machinery (United States),Intelligent process adaptation in the SmartPM system,10.1145/2948071,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275613405,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"The inclusion of embedded sensors into a networked system provides useful
information for many applications. A Distributed Control System (DCS) is one of the
clearest examples where processing and communications are constrained by the client s
requirements and the capacity of the system. An embedded sensor with advanced
processing and communications capabilities supplies high level information, abstracting
from the data acquisition process and objects recognition mechanisms. The implementation
of an embedded sensor/actuator as a Smart Resource permits clients to access sensor
information through distributed network services. Smart resources can offer sensor services
as well as computing, communications and peripheral access by implementing a self-aware
based adaptation mechanism which adapts the execution profile to the context. On the
other hand, information integrity must be ensured when computing processes are
dynamically adapted. Therefore, the processing must be adapted to perform tasks in a
certain lapse of time but always ensuring a minimum process quality. In the same way,
communications must try to reduce the data traffic without excluding relevant information.
The main objective of the paper is to present a dynamic configuration mechanism to adapt
the sensor processing and communication to the client s requirements in the DCS. This
paper describes an implementation of a smart resource based on a Red, Green, Blue, and
Depth (RGBD) sensor in order to test the dynamic configuration mechanism presented.This work has been supported by the Spanish Science and Innovation Ministry MICINN under the CICYT project M2C2: ""Codiseno de sistemas de control con criticidad mixta basado en misiones"" TIN2014-56158-C4-4-P and the Programme for Research and Development PAID of the Polytechnic University of Valencia: UPV-PAID-FPI-2013.

346545484,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',VIS4ML: an ontology for visual analytics assisted machine learning,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
18540517,2013-05-01T00:00:00,"The current challenge in automatic brain tumor classification based on MRS is the improvement of the robustness of the classification models that explicitly account for the probable breach of the independent and identically distributed conditions in the MRS data points. To contribute to this purpose, a new algorithm for the extraction of discriminant MRS features of brain tumors based on a functional approach is presented. Functional data analysis based on region segmentation (RSFDA) is based on the functional data analysis formalism using nonuniformly distributed B splines according to spectral regions that are highly correlated. An exhaustive characterization of the method is presented in this work using controlled and real scenarios. The performance of RSFDA was compared with other widely used feature extraction methods. In all simulated conditions, RSFDA was proven to be stable with respect to the number of variables selected and with respect to the classification performance against noise and baseline artifacts. Furthermore, with real multicenter datasets classification, RSFDA and peak integration (PI) obtained better performance than the other feature extraction methods used for comparison. Other advantages of the method proposed are its usefulness in selecting the optimal number of features for classification and its simplified functional representation of the spectra, which contributes to highlight the discriminative regions of the MR spectrum for each classification task. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The authors gratefully acknowledge former INTERPRET and eTUMOUR European project partners.

The deployment of this robot in healthcare sector has improved patient care and health. The vision system in a telepresence robot allows two way audiovisual communication between people at different location. In spite of such advancement, the manual way of controlling a robot to recognise and track people during an emergency is not favourable for a long duration. To circumvent this problem, biometric method using human face is proposed in this research which is implemented on Medical Telediagnosis Robot. This paper details the design of the face recognition and tracking system with four automated modules which are motion detection, face detection, face recognition and face tracking. The modules are developed with different algorithm and tested individually to ensure the stability of the system. Artificial Intelligence technique was applied at the face recognition stage while a two degree of freedom mechanism for actuator control was used at face tracking stage. A sequential mode operation is proposed to reduce the execution time in a real-time environment. To achieve this, only one module is operated at each time. A Graphical User Interface was developed to ease the users at the local and robot environment. The system is designed in LabVIEW platform. The biometric system proposed with hybrid algorithm at each module adapts for face images detected at different distances, poses and lighting condition. This system was tested in real-time and has an execution time of 55ms and 98% accuracy.

300465489,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",'Elsevier BV',Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Eligibility reflected anticipated Ministry of Health VL monitoring criteria. Testing was conducted at a central laboratory. Virological failure was defined as >5000 copies/ml. Primary outcomes were program feasibility (timely result availability and patient receipt) and effectiveness (second-line therapy initiation).ResultsWe enrolled 1,498 participants; 5.9% were failing at baseline. Median time from enrollment to receipt of results was 42 days; 79.6% of participants received results within 3 months. Among participants with confirmed elevated VL, 92.6% initiated second-line therapy; 90.7% were switched within 365 days of VL testing. Nearly one-third (30.8%) of participants with elevated baseline VL had suppressed (4 years were more likely to be failing than participants on therapy 1–4 years (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8); older participants were less likely to be failing (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98). There was no difference in likelihood of failure based on clinical symptoms (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.65-2.11).ConclusionsDBS for VL monitoring is feasible and effective in real-world clinical settings.

225416598,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) sizing in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial for follow-up and outcome. Recently, the automated quantification of LA using the novel three-beat averaging real-time three dimensional echocardiography (3BA-RT3DE) is introduced. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of 3BA-RT3DE in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

METHODS: Thirty-one patients with AF (62.8 ± 11.7 years, 67.7 % male) were prospectively recruited to have two dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and 3BA-RT3DE (SC 2000, ACUSON, USA). The maximal left atrial (LA) volume was measured by the conventional prolate-ellipse (PE) and area-length (AL) method using three-beat averaging 2D transthoracic echocardiography and automated software analysis (eSie volume analysis, Siemens Medical Solution, Mountain view, USA); measurements were compared with those obtained by computed tomography (CT).

RESULTS: Maximal LA volume by 3BA-RT3DE was feasible for all patients. LA volume was 68.4 ± 28.2 by PE-2DE, 89.2 ± 33.1 by AL-2DE, 100.6 ± 31.8 by 3BA-RT3DE, and 131.2 ± 42.2 mL by CT. LA volume from PE-2DE (R(2) = 0.48, p < 0.001, ICC = 0.64, p < 0.001), AL-2DE (R(2) = 0.47, p < 0.001, ICC = 0.67, p < 0.001), and 3BA-RT3DE (R(2) = 0.50, p = 0.001, ICC = 0.65, p < 0.001) showed significant correlations with CT. However, 3BA-RT3DE demonstrated a small degree of underestimation (30.5 mL) of LA volume compared to 2DE-based measurements. Good-quality images from 3BA-RT3DE (n = 16) showed a significantly tighter correlation with images from CT scanning (R(2) = 0.60, p = 0.0004, ICC = 0.76, p < 0.001) compared to those of fair quality.

CONCLUSION: Automated quantification of LA volume using 3BA-RT3DE is feasible and accurate in patients with AF.

79183572,2016-04-01T00:00:00,"This paper proposes a modification to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to select the most informative genes that serve as inputs to an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) for cancer classification. Unlike the conventional AHP, the modified AHP allows us to process quantitative factors that are ranking outcomes of individual gene selection methods including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test, and signal-to-noise ratio. The IT2FLS is introduced for the classification task due to its great ability for handling nonlinear, noisy, and outlier data, which are common problems in cancer microarray gene expression profiles. An unsupervised learning strategy using the fuzzy c-means clustering is employed to initialize parameters of the IT2FLS. Other classifiers such as multilayer perceptron network, support vector machine, and fuzzy ARTMAP are also implemented for comparisons. Experiments are carried out on three well-known microarray datasets: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer, and prostate. Rather than the traditional cross validation, leave-one-out cross-validation strategy is applied for the experiments. Results demonstrate the performance dominance of the IT2FLS against the competing classifiers. More noticeably, the modified AHP improves the classification performance not only of the IT2FLS but of all other classifiers as well. Accordingly, the proposed combination between the modified AHP and IT2FLS is a powerful tool for cancer classification and can be implemented as a real clinical decision support system that is useful for medical practitioners",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Modified AHP for gene selection and cancer classification using type-2 fuzzy logic,10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2453153,http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30084985,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

196141017,2018,"According to statistics, every fifth married couple is faced with the inability to conceive a child. Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample. At the final stage of study, the program's functioningwas tested on real data.За статистикою, кожна п'ята подружня пара стикається з неможливістю зачаття дитини.

При побудові спермограми, важливо визначати не тільки кількість добрих сперматозоїдів, але й їх морфологію та рухливість. Тому дослідження та вдосконалення деяких етапів спермограми і є метою дослідження. У даній статті вирішується задача класифікації сперматозоїдів на добрі та погані, з урахуванням їх рухливості та морфології, із застосуванням методів машинного навчання. Для реалізації першого етапу машинного навчання (з вчителем) у графічному редакторі були створені навчальні екземпляри (тренувальна вибірка). Навчання було реалізована трьома методами: методом опорних векторів, логістична регресія та метод К - найближчих сусідів. За результатами тестування обрано метод К - найближчих сусідів. На етапі тестування використовувалася вибірка з 15 різних сперматозоїдів в різних варіаціях обертання навколо своєї осі. Тестова вибірка не містила примірників з тренувальної вибірки і була сформована з урахуванням морфологічних особливостей сперматозоїдів, але не копіювала їх з тренувальної вибірки. На завершальному етапі навчання роботу програми було протестовано на реальних даних","Національний технічний університет ""Харківський політехнічний інститут""",Застосування методів машинного навчання для вирішення задачі аналізу біологічних даних,10.20998/2522-9052.2018.3.01,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

226465289,2015-04-21T07:42:35,"none582BACKGROUND: Multi-element interventions for first-episode psychosis (FEP) are promising, but have mostly been conducted in non-epidemiologically representative samples, thereby raising the risk of underestimating the complexities involved in treating FEP in 'real-world' services. METHODS/DESIGN: The Psychosis early Intervention and Assessment of Needs and Outcome (PIANO) trial is part of a larger research program (Genetics, Endophenotypes and Treatment: Understanding early Psychosis - GET UP) which aims to compare, at 9 months, the effectiveness of a multi-component psychosocial intervention versus treatment as usual (TAU) in a large epidemiologically based cohort of patients with FEP and their family members recruited from all public community mental health centers (CMHCs) located in two entire regions of Italy (Veneto and Emilia Romagna), and in the cities of Florence, Milan and Bolzano. The GET UP PIANO trial has a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled design. The randomized units (clusters) are the CMHCs, and the units of observation are the centers' patients and their family members. Patients in the experimental group will receive TAU plus: 1) cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, 2) psycho-educational sessions for family members, and 3) case management. Patient enrollment will take place over a 1-year period. Several psychopathological, psychological, functioning, and service use variables will be assessed at baseline and follow-up. The primary outcomes are: 1) change from baseline to follow-up in positive and negative symptoms' severity and subjective appraisal; 2) relapse occurrences between baseline and follow-up, that is, episodes resulting in admission and/or any case-note records of re-emergence of positive psychotic symptoms. The expected number of recruited patients is about 400, and that of relatives about 300. Owing to the implementation of the intervention at the CMHC level, the blinding of patients, clinicians, and raters is not possible, but every effort will be made to preserve the independency of the raters. We expect that this study will generate evidence on the best treatments for FEP, and will identify barriers that may hinder its feasibility in 'real-world' clinical settings, patient/family conditions that may render this intervention ineffective or inappropriate, and clinical, psychological, environmental, and service organization predictors of treatment effectiveness, compliance, and service satisfaction.Ruggeri M, Bonetto C, Lasalvia A, De Girolamo G, Fioritti A, Rucci P, Santonastaso P, Neri G, Pileggi F, Ghigi D, Miceli M, Scarone S, Cocchi A, Torresani S, Faravelli C, Zimmermann C, Meneghelli A, Cremonese C, Scocco P, Leuci E, Mazzi F, Gennarelli M, Brambilla P, Bissoli S, Bertani ME, Tosato S, De Santi K, Poli S, Cristofalo D, Tansella M; GET UP GROUP, Ruggeri M, Mirella ME, Bissoli S, Bonetto C, Cristofalo D, De Santi K, Lasalvia A, Lunardi S, Negretto V, Poli S, Tosato S, Zamboni MG, Ballarin M, De Girolamo G, Fioritti A, Neri G, Pileggi F, Rucci P, Bocchio Chiavetto L, Scasselatti C, Zanardini R, Brambilla P, Bellani M, Bertoldo A, Marinelli V, Negretto V, Perlini C, Rambaldelli G, Lasalvia A, Bertani M, Bissoli S, Lazzarotto L, Bardella S, Gardellin F, Lamonaca D, Lasalvia A, Lunardon M, Magnabosco R, Martucci M, Nicolau S, Nifosì F, Pavanati M, Rossi M, Piazza C, Piccione G, Sala A, Sale A, Stefan B, Zotos S, Balbo M, Boggian I, Ceccato E, Dall'Agnola R, Gardellin F, Girotto B, Goss C, Lamonaca D, Lasalvia A, Leoni R, Mai A, Pasqualini A, Pavanati M, Piazza C,

From a real 4D sequence, a software pipeline is applied to create several synthetic sequences by combining various steps including motion tracking and segmentation. We use here this synthetic database to train a machine learning algorithm which estimates the depolarization times of each cardiac segment from invariant kinematic descriptors such as local displacements or strains. First experiments on the inverse electro- kinematic learning are demonstrated on the synthetic 3D US database and are evaluated on clinical 3D US sequences from two patients with Left Bundle Branch Block",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Synthetic Echocardiographic Image Sequences for Cardiac Inverse Electro-Kinematic Learning,10.1007/978-3-642-23623-5_63,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
323317300,2011-04-08T00:00:00,"[EN] This paper proposes a methodology for the recognition of surgical maneuvers in laparoscopic surgical interventions. The aim is to create an interface between the surgeon and a surgical robotic assistant for two arms of minimally invasive surgery procedures. The proposed interface receives information about the positioning of surgical tools of the surgeon using 3D sensors and the recognition system facilitates the current maneuver is completed. Therefore, the recognition system maneuvers that supports this interface requires a library of models of maneuvers to work. The models chosen to represent the surgical maneuvers are Hidden Markov Models. To validate the proposed methodology, we have developed a series of in-vitro experiments.[ES] Este trabajo propone una metodología para el reconocimiento de maniobras quirúrgicas en intervenciones de cirugía laparoscópica. El objetivo es la creación de un interfaz entre el cirujano y un asistente robótico quirúrgico de dos brazos para procesos de cirugía mínimamente invasiva.

Por lo tanto, el sistema de reconocimiento de maniobras sobre el que se apoya este interfaz necesita una librería de modelos de maniobras para trabajar.

213007942,2011,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium which is the causative agent of melioidosis, a common cause of fatal bacterial pneumonia and sepsis in the tropics. The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n =40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n =40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n =16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml. Comparison of isolates using multilocus sequence typing demonstrated clinical matches and close associations between environmental isolates and isolates derived from clinical samples from patients in Townsville. This study demonstrated that waterborne B. pseudomallei from groundwater seeps around Castle Hill may facilitate exposure to B. pseudomallei and contribute to the clinical clustering at this site. Access to this type of information will advise the development and implementation of public health measures to reduce the incidence of melioidosis. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology",American Society for Microbiology,Groundwater seeps facilitate exposure to Burkholderia pseudomallei,10.1128/AEM.05048-11,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213007942.pdf,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
82663801,4/30/2010,"Background/PurposeThe postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, caused by the porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2), is a major disease that poses a significant threat to the global swine industry. The purpose of this study was to establish a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the quantification of PCV-2 and to enable the rapid differentiation of porcine circoviruses type 1 and 2 (PCV-1 and PCV-2). Such a method would significantly speed up the process of clinical diagnosis, and could also be used to study the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases associated with PCV-2.MethodsMultiplex real-time PCR, together with LightCycler PCR data analysis software, was used for the quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2. A 263-bp DNA fragment was amplified from the 3′ end of the open reading frame-2 of PCV-2 by nested PCR, and its DNA sequence was verified as having 100% identity with a PCV-2 standard (NCBI accession number: AF055394). The 263-bp DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector, and the recombinant plasmid was serially diluted and quantified using real-time PCR. A standard curve was then constructed for quantification of the PCV-2 levels in field samples. The differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2 was carried out by analyzing the melting temperatures of the genotype-specific PCR products.ResultsTo quantify the PCV-2 levels in field samples, a standard curve (1 × 102 −1 × 109 copies/μL) was constructed. PCV-2 concentrations as low as 1 × 102 copies/mL could be detected in specimens taken from the lymph nodes or infected tissues in samples of PCV-2-infected pigs. The diagnosis of PCV-1 and PCV-2 infections and the quantification of the viral load in the field samples could be completed within 45 minutes after extracting the viral DNA using a commercial extraction kit.ConclusionThis study demonstrate that real-time PCR is a clinically feasible method for the accurate quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2",Taiwan Society of Microbiology.

Organizational mechanisms can be introduced into a Multi-Agent System with the aim of influencing the behavior of agents populating it to achieve their goals in a proper way. In this paper, we propose to model organizational mechanisms by means of artifacts, which are non-proactive entities used by agents. Artifacts were presented within the Agents & Artifacts conceptual framework, and that present good advantages for coordinating agents' environments. We put forward a formal model that defines how organizational mechanisms can be designed by using artifacts theory. We validate the approach by presenting a case study focused on a real health care domain problem. Additionally, the Artifacts for Organizational Mechanisms are compared with some different proposed artifacts. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.This work is supported by TIN2009-13839-C03 and PROMETEO/2008/051 projects of the Spanish government, CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 under grant CSD2007-00022, and the COST Action IC0801.Esparcia García, S.; Argente Villaplana, E.; Centeno, R.; Hermoso, R.

The dynamics of the GCF is based on the estimation of the final state related to each alternative via a net of concepts and some evolution functions that define how the initial state will evolve given a certain alternative. The GCF scores the alternatives computing their expected utility and so, it requires a probability value associated to each possible final state. The estimated values of the criteria that characterize a state are bounded using fuzzy sets, which provide an easy method for assigning probability values. The GCF considers that it could be necessary to carry out simultaneously more than one alternative to mitigate a fire emergency.[ES] Este trabajo propone un Sistema Computacional de Ayuda a la Decisión, el Gestor de Crisis de Fuego (GCF), diseñado para ayudar a una persona a tomar decisiones en tiempo real en situaciones de emergencia, concretamente, en caso de incendio en un edificio. El funcionamiento del GCF se basa principalmente en la estimación del estado final asociado a cada alternativa a través de una red de conceptos y unas funciones de evolución que serán aplicadas al estado inicial. El GCF tiene en cuenta que para mitigar la crisis producida por un incendio pueden ser necesarias varias alternativas ejecutándose simultáneamente.Este  trabajo  se  ha  desarrollado  dentro  del  marco  del  proyecto HESPERIA (CDTI-Programa CENIT-2005).Iglesias, Á.; Del Castillo, MD.; Serrano, JI.; Oliva, J.

224742248,2010-07-14T00:00:00,"Due to increasing numbers of wind energy converters, the accurate assessment of the lifespan of their structural parts and the entire converter system is becoming more and more paramount. Lifespan-oriented design, inspections and remedial maintenance are challenging because of their complex dynamic behavior. Wind energy converters are subjected to stochastic turbulent wind loading causing corresponding stochastic structural response and vibrations associated with an extreme number of stress cycles (up to 109 according to the rotation of the blades). Currently, wind energy converters are constructed for a service life of about 20 years. However, this estimation is more or less made by rule of thumb and not backed by profound scientific analyses or accurate simulations. By contrast, modern structural health monitoring systems allow an improved identification of deteriorations and, thereupon, to drastically advance the lifespan assessment of wind energy converters. In particular, monitoring systems based on artificial intelligence techniques represent a promising approach towards cost-efficient and reliable real-time monitoring. Therefore, an innovative real-time structural health monitoring concept based on software agents is introduced in this contribution. For a short time, this concept is also turned into a real-world monitoring system developed in a DFG joint research project in the authors’ institute at the Ruhr-University Bochum.

74313337,2002-01-01T00:00:00,"In this paper we present two novel techniques, namely a local unwarping polynomial (LUP) and a hierarchical radial basis function (HRBF) network, to correct geometric distortions in XRII images. The two techniques have been implemented and compared, in terms of residual error measured at control and intermediate points, with local and global methods reported in the previous literature. In particular, LUP rests on a locally optimized 3rd degree polynomial applied within each quadrilateral cell on the rectilinear calibration grid of points. HRBF, based on a feed-forward neural network paradigm, is constituted by a set of hierarchical layers at increasing cut-off frequency, each characterized by a set of Gaussian functions. Extensive experiments have been performed both on simulated and real data. In simulation, we tested the effect of pincushion, sigmoidal and local distortions, along with the number of calibration points. Provided that a sufficient number of cells of the calibration grid is available, the obtained accuracy for both LUP and HRBF is comparable to or better than that of global polynomial technique. Tests on real data, carried out by using two different (12 in. and 16 in.) XRIIs, showed that the global polynomial accuracy (0.16 ±.08 pixels) is slightly worse than that of LUP (0.07±0.05 pixels) and HRBF (0.08 ± 0.04 pixels). The effects of the discontinuity at the border of the local areas and the decreased accuracy at intermediate points, typical of local techniques, have been proved to be smoothed for both LUP and HRBF. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",'Wiley',Distortion correction for x-ray image intensifiers: Local unwarping polynomials and RBF neural networks,10.1118/1.1488602,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p=0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p=0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p=0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p=0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p=0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p=0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p=0.49) and NOTSS (p>0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.ConclusionsPart- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention.

FQ-PCR is also used in scientific research for detection of HBV DNA in cell culture. Understanding potential FQ-PCR interference factors can improve the accuracy of HBV DNA quantification in cell culture medium. HBV positive serum was diluted with culture medium to produce three test groups with HBV DNA levels of 5 x 107 copies/ml (high), 5 x 105 copies/ml (medium), and 5 x 103 copies/ml (low). Chromosome DNA was extracted from HepG2 cells and then added to high, medium, and low group samples at final concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mu g/ml. The samples were quantified by FQ-PCR and data were evaluated using statistical software. No marked changes were seen in the quantitative curves for high level HBV DNA samples when the samples were supplemented with 0-100 mu g/ml of chromosome DNA. Interference was observed in medium level samples when 50 and 100 mu g/ml of chromosome DNA was added. Interference was also observed in low level HBV DNA samples when the concentration of added chromosome DNA was greater than 25 mu g/ml. The interference was eliminated when samples were digested by DNase I prior to PCR detection.

199265210,1998-01-01T00:00:00,"During reactor upset/abnormal conditions, emphasis is placed on the plant operator's ability to quickly identify the problem and perform diagnosis and initiate recovery action to ensure the safety of the plant. However, the reliability of human action is adversely affected at the time of crisis due to time stress and psychological factors. The availability of operational aids capable of monitoring the status of the plant and quickly identifying the deviation from normal operation is expected to significantly improve the operator reliability. The development of operator support systems using probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) techniques and information is finding wide application in nuclear plant operation. Often it is observed that most of the applications use a rule-based approach for diagnosis as well as safety status/transient conditions monitoring. A more efficient approach using artificial neural networks for safety status/transient condition monitoring and rule-based systems for diagnosis and emergency procedure generation has been applied for the development of a prototype operator adviser (OPAD) system for a 100 MW(th) heavy water moderated, cooled and natural uranium fueled research reactor. The development objective of this system is to improve the reliability of operator action and hence the reactor safety at the time of crisis as well as in normal operation. In order to address safety objectives at various stages of development of OPAD, the PSA techniques and tools have been used for knowledge representation. It has been demonstrated, with recall tests on the artificial neural network, that it can efficiently identify the reactor status in real-time scenario.

208883124,12/31/2010,"AbstractThe technology of amine-based carbon dioxide (CO2) capture has been widely adopted for reducing CO2 emissions and mitigating global warming. The operation of an amine-based CO2 capture system is complicated and involves monitoring over one hundred process parameters and careful manipulation of numerous valves and pumps. The monitoring and control of critical parameters of the process is an important task because it directly impacts plant performance and capture efficiency of CO2. In this study, artificial intelligence techniques were applied to develop a knowledge-based expert system that aims to effectively monitor and control the CO2 capture process, and thereby enhance CO2 capture efficiency. The Knowledge-Based System for Carbon Dioxide Capture (KBSCDC) was implemented with DeltaV Simulate (trademark of Emerson Corp., USA). DeltaV Simulate provides control utilities and algorithms which support the configuration of control strategies in modular components. The KBSCDC can conduct real-time monitoring and diagnosis, as well as suggest remedies for any abnormality detected. Also, the control strategies applied to the control devices of the process are simulated in KBSCDC. The expert system enhances performance and efficiency of the CO2 capture system because it supports automated diagnosis of the system should any abnormal conditions occur. In developing the system, the Inferential Modeling Technique (IMT) was applied to analyze the domain knowledge and problem-solving techniques.

The purpose of this study was to establish a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the quantification of PCV-2 and to enable the rapid differentiation of porcine circoviruses type 1 and 2 (PCV-1 and PCV-2). Such a method would significantly speed up the process of clinical diagnosis, and could also be used to study the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases associated with PCV-2.MethodsMultiplex real-time PCR, together with LightCycler PCR data analysis software, was used for the quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2. A 263-bp DNA fragment was amplified from the 3′ end of the open reading frame-2 of PCV-2 by nested PCR, and its DNA sequence was verified as having 100% identity with a PCV-2 standard (NCBI accession number: AF055394). The 263-bp DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector, and the recombinant plasmid was serially diluted and quantified using real-time PCR. A standard curve was then constructed for quantification of the PCV-2 levels in field samples. The differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2 was carried out by analyzing the melting temperatures of the genotype-specific PCR products.ResultsTo quantify the PCV-2 levels in field samples, a standard curve (1 × 102 −1 × 109 copies/μL) was constructed. PCV-2 concentrations as low as 1 × 102 copies/mL could be detected in specimens taken from the lymph nodes or infected tissues in samples of PCV-2-infected pigs.

Ultrasound images were acquired on a Philips 7500 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts) with a matrix-array transducer (real-time 3D echo) with full volume sweeps from apical and subcostal views. Sagittal, 4-chamber, and coronal views were derived for contour detection (all 12 to 24 slices). The MR images were acquired with a 3-T MRI magnet with segmented cine-loop gradient echo sequences in short- and rotated long-axis views to cover the RV inflow, body, and outflow tract. The RV volumes were analyzed with the new software applicable to 3D echo MR images.ResultsNew software aided delineation of the RV free wall, tricuspid valve, RV outflow tract, and apex on 3D echo volumes. Although there was a slightly higher variability measuring right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and volumes obtained by US compared with MRI, both imaging methods showed closely correlated results. The RVEF was measured with 4% variability for US and 5% variability for MRI with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.91. The RV end-diastolic volume was measured at 70.97 ± 15.0 ml with 3D US and at 70.06 ± 14.8 ml with MRI (r = 0.99), end-systolic volume measured 39.8 ± 10.4 ml with 3D US and 39.1 ± 10.2 ml with MRI (r = 0.98).ConclusionsThe new RV analysis software allowed validation of the accuracy of 4D echo RV volume data compared with MRI",American College of Cardiology Foundation.

155565312,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"In lung cancer radiotherapy, radiation to a mobile target can be delivered by respiratory gating, for which we need to know whether the target is inside or outside a predefined gating window at any time point during the treatment. This can be achieved by tracking one or more fiducial markers implanted inside or near the target, either fluoroscopically or electromagnetically. However, the clinical implementation of marker tracking is limited for lung cancer radiotherapy mainly due to the risk of pneumothorax. Therefore, gating without implanted fiducial markers is a promising clinical direction. We have developed several template-matching methods for fluoroscopic marker-less gating. Recently, we have modeled the gating problem as a binary pattern classification problem, in which principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) are combined to perform the classification task. Following the same framework, we investigated different combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and four nonlinear manifold learning methods) and two machine learning classification methods (artificial neural networks-ANN and SVM). Performance was evaluated on ten fluoroscopic image sequences of nine lung cancer patients. We found that among all combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and classification methods, PCA combined with either ANN or SVM achieved a better performance than the other nonlinear manifold learning methods. ANN when combined with PCA achieves a better performance than SVM in terms of classification accuracy and recall rate, although the target coverage is similar for the two classification methods. Furthermore, the running time for both ANN and SVM with PCA is within tolerance for real-time applications. Overall, ANN combined with PCA is a better candidate than other combinations we investigated in this work for real-time gated radiotherapy.Engineering, BiomedicalRadiology, Nuclear Medicine &amp; Medical ImagingSCI(E)15ARTICLE61555-15635",'IOP Publishing',Markerless gating for lung cancer radiotherapy based on machine learning   techniques,10.1088/0031-9155/54/6/010,,"[{'title': 'Physics in Medicine and Biology', 'identifiers': ['issn:0031-9155', '0031-9155']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Heating elements were used to provide a constant heat source in order to simulate the production of metabolites by the cells. The design of experiments determined the use of nine sensors at both factorial and axial locations.

295462858,7/5/2010,"Computer science studies possess a strong multidisciplinary vocation; most graduates do their professional work elsewhere of a computing environment, in collaboration with professionals from many different areas. However, the training offered in computer science studies lacks that multidisciplinary, focusing more on purely technical aspects. The campus, a place where studies of very different nature exist side by side, may constitute an excellent basis for conducting multidisciplinary training without underestimating higher education rigor. The aim of the universities is to train their students in the skills demanded by businesses and companies. According to experts, students need to develop more the skills called generic in which can be found the interpersonal skills. This paper presents a good example where computer studies and educational psychology find out a common ground and realistic working through laboratory practices. Specifically, the work enables to students of computer science education the development of diagnosis support systems, with artificial intelligence techniques, that could then be used for future educational psychologists. The applications developed by computer science students is the creation of a model for the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), sometimes also commonly called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The complexity of this diagnosis, not only by the exclusive characteristics of every person who suffer it but also by the large numbers of variables involved in it, requires a very strong and closed interdisciplinary participation. Moreover, for the enhancement of this software (and especially for the collection and creation of the database) it has been required the creation of a working framework which involves doctors and families, as well as those students of computer science and educational psychology already mentioned. The final purpose of this tool for the diagnosis is its applicability in primary schools to increase the early detection and diagnosis. Meanwhile, students of educational psychology incorporate their knowledge to adjust the computer application successfully, incorporating it the qualitative and quantitative information needed for verification. As a result of this synergy, a good interdisciplinary teamwork has emerged, closer to the real world than the university and which all would be enriched. In this sense, this work demonstrates that it is possible to intervene in a curricular perspective, in the university, to promote the development of interpersonal skills. It can be shown, in this way, a methodology for interdisciplinary practices design and a guide for monitoring and evaluation",IATED,Development of multidisciplinary practical lessons through research-action methodology in the faculties of computer science and educational psychology,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

82019810,8/31/2011,"AbstractObjective(s)Patient-specific simulated rehearsal (PsR) is a technological advance within the domain of endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation. It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p=0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p=0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p=0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p=0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p=0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p=0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p=0.49) and NOTSS (p>0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.ConclusionsPart- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention.

Ultrasound images were acquired on a Philips 7500 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts) with a matrix-array transducer (real-time 3D echo) with full volume sweeps from apical and subcostal views. Sagittal, 4-chamber, and coronal views were derived for contour detection (all 12 to 24 slices). The MR images were acquired with a 3-T MRI magnet with segmented cine-loop gradient echo sequences in short- and rotated long-axis views to cover the RV inflow, body, and outflow tract. The RV volumes were analyzed with the new software applicable to 3D echo MR images.ResultsNew software aided delineation of the RV free wall, tricuspid valve, RV outflow tract, and apex on 3D echo volumes. Although there was a slightly higher variability measuring right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and volumes obtained by US compared with MRI, both imaging methods showed closely correlated results. The RVEF was measured with 4% variability for US and 5% variability for MRI with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.91. The RV end-diastolic volume was measured at 70.97 ± 15.0 ml with 3D US and at 70.06 ± 14.8 ml with MRI (r = 0.99), end-systolic volume measured 39.8 ± 10.4 ml with 3D US and 39.1 ± 10.2 ml with MRI (r = 0.98).ConclusionsThe new RV analysis software allowed validation of the accuracy of 4D echo RV volume data compared with MRI",American College of Cardiology Foundation.

A number of measures have been applied in order to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities in roads, i.e., implementation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based on image processing. In this paper, a real time speed supervisor based on road sign recognition that can work both in urban and non-urban environments is presented. The system is able to recognize 135 road signs, belonging to the danger, yield, prohibition obligation and indication types, and sends warning messages to the driver upon the combination of two pieces of information: the current speed of the car and the road sign symbol. The core of this paper is the comparison between the two main methods which have been traditionally used for detection and recognition of road signs: template matching (TM) and neural networks (NN). The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches will be shown and commented.

82126746,12/31/2010,"AbstractThe technology of amine-based carbon dioxide (CO2) capture has been widely adopted for reducing CO2 emissions and mitigating global warming. The operation of an amine-based CO2 capture system is complicated and involves monitoring over one hundred process parameters and careful manipulation of numerous valves and pumps. The monitoring and control of critical parameters of the process is an important task because it directly impacts plant performance and capture efficiency of CO2. In this study, artificial intelligence techniques were applied to develop a knowledge-based expert system that aims to effectively monitor and control the CO2 capture process, and thereby enhance CO2 capture efficiency. The Knowledge-Based System for Carbon Dioxide Capture (KBSCDC) was implemented with DeltaV Simulate (trademark of Emerson Corp., USA). DeltaV Simulate provides control utilities and algorithms which support the configuration of control strategies in modular components. The KBSCDC can conduct real-time monitoring and diagnosis, as well as suggest remedies for any abnormality detected. Also, the control strategies applied to the control devices of the process are simulated in KBSCDC. The expert system enhances performance and efficiency of the CO2 capture system because it supports automated diagnosis of the system should any abnormal conditions occur. In developing the system, the Inferential Modeling Technique (IMT) was applied to analyze the domain knowledge and problem-solving techniques. The knowledge base of KBSCDC can be shared and reused, and can contribute to future study of the CO2 capture process",Published by Elsevier B.V.,Monitoring and Diagnosis of the Carbon Dioxide Capture Process Using an Intelligent System Approach ,10.1016/j.proenv.2010.10.002,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82126746.pdf,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

19606375,2011-10,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium which is the causative agent of melioidosis, a common cause of fatal bacterial pneumonia and sepsis in the tropics. The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n = 40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n = 40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n = 16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml. Comparison of isolates using multilocus sequence typing demonstrated clinical matches and close associations between environmental isolates and isolates derived from clinical samples from patients in Townsville. This study demonstrated that waterborne B. pseudomallei from groundwater seeps around Castle Hill may facilitate exposure to B. pseudomallei and contribute to the clinical clustering at this site. Access to this type of information will advise the development and implementation of public health measures to reduce the incidence of melioidosis",American Society for Microbiology,Groundwater seeps facilitate exposure to Burkholderia pseudomallei,10.1128/AEM.05048-11,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
