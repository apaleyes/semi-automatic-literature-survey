287429785,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of wireless sensor networks, which are the key ingredient in the growing Internet of Things (IoT), has surged over the past few years with a widening range of applications in the industry, healthcare, agriculture, with a special attention to monitoring and tracking, often tied with security issues. In some applications, sensors can be deployed in remote, large unpopulated areas, whereas in others, they serve to monitor confined busy spaces. In either case, clustering the sensor network’s nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network’s lifetime. In the present paper, we survey and compare popular and advanced clustering schemes and provide a detailed analysis of their performance as a function of scale, type of collected data or their heterogeneity, and noise level.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",HAL CCSD,Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

333569035,2020,"Integrated clinical pathways (ICPs) are task-oriented care plans detailing the essential steps of the therapeutic pathway referring to a specific clinical problem with a patient’s expected clinical course. ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient’s health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based approaches",'MDPI AG',Design and Execution of Integrated Clinical Pathway: A Simplified Meta-Model and Associated Methodology,10.3390/info11070362,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
428925085,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"Background: Blood donors are at risk for reduced iron stores, because of which donor iron monitoring received increased attention in the last decade. Despite the importance for donor health, international consensus on an appropriate policy for iron monitoring is lacking. Therefore, we conduct a trial to evaluate to what extent ferritin-guided donation intervals are effective in increasing haemoglobin and ferritin levels, decreasing low-haemoglobin deferral, increasing donor return and improving the health of whole blood donors in the Netherlands. Methods: Sanquin Blood Bank is implementing ferritin-guided donation intervals to prevent donors from increasing iron loss at repeated donations. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial approach, the design involves a random crossover of 29 clusters of blood collection centres from the existing policy without ferritin measurements to a ferritin-guided donation interval policy. This new policy includes ferritin measurements for all new donors and at every 5th whole blood donation, extending donation intervals to 6 months if ferritin is 15-≤ 30 ng/mL and to 12 months if ferritin is < 15 ng/mL. We measure ferritin levels of whole blood donors from stored plasma samples and collect haemoglobin levels and information on low-haemoglobin deferral and donor return from the donor database before, during and after the implementation period. We measure donor health during and after the implementation period using questionnaires, assessing physical and mental wellbeing and iron deficiency- and donation-related symptoms. We use multilevel analyses to investigate differences in ferritin and haemoglobin levels, low-haemoglobin deferral rates, donor return and donor health from whole blood donors, between blood collection centres that have versus those that have not yet implemented the ferritin-guided donation interval policy. Discussion: This stepped wedge cluster randomised trial will provide insight into the effectiveness of ferritin-guided donation intervals in lowering iron deficiency, decreasing donor deferrals due to low haemoglobin and improving donor health. We will evaluate a policy that is implemented nationwide in a real-life setting. Our study is therefore not limited to a small experimental setting and the results will guide policymakers seeking an appropriate policy for iron monitoring.

300365238,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.publishe",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',VIS4ML : An Ontology for Visual Analytics Assisted Machine Learning,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864838,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Exploratory qualitative research employed as methods of inquiry. Twelve resource persons were interviewed (3 teachers and 9 parents). The data revealed, parents and teachers perceive that using home visits has a number of benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are as follows: 1) more effective than online; 2) make learning materials easy for children to understand; 3) pique children's interest and excitement for learning; and 4) eliminate the need for parents to assist their children with their tasks. Meanwhile, the downsides include the following: 1) it was inconvenient for parents because they were needed to entertain teachers and other children; 2) some pupils couldn't study because home visits were far away from their homes.; 3) additional media and learning activities preparation; 4) additional time and energy was wasted; and 5) the risk of exposure to COVID-19 was increased. The researchers recommend that additional study be conducted with a larger and more diverse sample size in order to obtain a more complete picture of this issue.

487585666,2021-10-02T00:00:00,"International audienceBackground: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular-omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods: The European ""ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)"" consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results: This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the ""ITFoC Challenge"". This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets. Conclusions: The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized care",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A framework for validating AI in precision medicine: considerations from the European ITFoC consortium,10.1186/s12911-021-01634-3,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429033224,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.

The cutting tool is a critical asset of the milling machine; the failure of the cutting tool causes a loss in industrial productivity due to unplanned downtime. In such cases, a proper predictive maintenance strategy by real-time health monitoring of cutting tools becomes essential. Accurately predicting the useful life of equipment plays a vital role in the predictive maintenance arena of industry 4.0.

So, the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive literature survey on the data-driven approach of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation of cutting tools during the milling process. The authors have summarized different monitoring techniques, feature extraction methods, decision-making models, and available sensors currently used in the data-driven model. The authors have also presented publicly available datasets related to milling under various operating conditions to compare the accuracy of the prediction model for tool wear estimation.

389359328,2021-01-14T00:00:00,"Cardiovascular diseases have been reported to be the leading cause of mortality across the globe. Among such diseases, Myocardial Infarction (MI), also known as “heart attack”, is of main interest among researchers, as its early diagnosis can prevent life threatening cardiac conditions and potentially save human lives. Analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG) can provide valuable diagnostic information to detect different types of cardiac arrhythmia. Real-time ECG monitoring systems with advanced machine learning methods provide information about the health status in real-time and have improved user’s experience. However, advanced machine learning methods have put a burden on portable and wearable devices due to their high computing requirements. We present an improved, less complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classifier model that identifies multiple arrhythmia types using the two-dimensional image of the ECG wave in real-time. The proposed model is presented as a three-layer ECG signal analysis model that can potentially be adopted in real-time portable and wearable monitoring devices. We have designed, implemented, and simulated the proposed CNN network using Matlab. We also present the hardware implementation of the proposed method to validate its adaptability in real-time wearable systems.

437429008,2022-03-31T00:00:00,"The Internet of Things (IoT), in combination with advancements in Big Data, communications and networked systems, offers a positive impact across a range of sectors including health, energy, manufacturing and transport. By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks. We demonstrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of Citrus: a novel intrusion detection framework which is adept at tackling emerging threats through the collection and labelling of live attack data by utilising diverse Internet vantage points in order to detect and classify malicious behaviour using graph-based metrics as well as a range of machine learning (ML) algorithms.

In this paper, leak detection was investigated using an experimental setup consisting of a plastic tank immersed underwater. Three different techniques for this purpose were implemented and compared with each other, including fast Fourier transform (FFT), wavelet transforms, and time-domain features, all of which are followed with 1D convolution neural network (1D-CNN).

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells.

Currently most TFPGs are manually constructed by system experts, a process that can be time-consuming, error-prone, and even impossible for systems with highly nonlinear and machine-learning-based components. This letter proposes a new type of TFPGs, called Real-Valued Timed Failure Propagation Graphs (rTFPGs), designed for continuous-state systems. More importantly, it presents a systematic way of constructing rTFPGs by combining the powers of human experts and data-driven methods: first, an expert constructs a partial rTFPG based on his/her expertise; then a data-driven algorithm refines the rTFPG by adding nodes and edges based on a given set of labeled signals.

481464351,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has a significant impact on the environment and human health. However, strong spatial heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dependence increases the difficulty of prediction. Moreover, due to the lag of the update of auxiliary variables at national scale in the prediction application, it is still difficult to achieve the timely nationwide PM2.5 prediction at present. To better model and predict real time concentrations and spatial distributions of PM2.5, this study developed a workflow of future PM2.5 concentrations prediction based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Using ground-based station PM2.5 data in 2014–2018, the 1 km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product and other auxiliary data to predict PM2.5 concentrations in the next year and generate a high-resolution national PM2.5 concentration spatial distribution map. The LSTM model outperformed random forest (RF) and Cubist approaches for prediction PM2.5 because of its recurrent neural network structure that can capture time dependence and nonlinear relationships among PM2.5 concentrations and other independent variables, and exhibited a stable accuracy with an R2 of 0.83, by applying the annual time series, with an improvement of 0.04–0.09, compared to daily and monthly data. The results indicated that PM2.5 pollution had gradually decreased in 2019 after application of pollution controls, with annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of 27.33 ± 15.56 μg m−3, although there were still some areas with severe pollution, including the North China Plain, parts of the Loess Plateau, and the Taklimakan Desert.

Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota.Methods: Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results.Results: AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3-11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa.Conclusion: Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa.

However, the technique has been hampered by technical limitations due to massive data throughput requirements and nonlinear inverse search algorithms, limiting it to an offline technique where data must be postprocessed. Aim: To present an MELSCI system capable of continuous acquisition and processing of MELSCI data, enabling real-time video-rate perfusion imaging with high accuracy. Approach: The MELSCI algorithm was implemented in programmable hardware (field programmable gate array) closely interfaced to a high-speed CMOS sensor for real-time calculation. Perfusion images were estimated in real-time from the MELSCI data using an artificial neural network trained on simulated data. The MELSCI perfusion was compared to two existing single-exposure metrics both quantitatively in a controlled phantom experiment and qualitatively in vivo. Results: The MELSCI perfusion shows higher signal dynamics compared to both single-exposure metrics, both spatially and temporally where heartbeat-related variations are resolved in much greater detail. The MELSCI perfusion is less susceptible to measurement noise and is more linear with respect to laser Doppler perfusion in the phantom experiment (R-2 = 0.992). Conclusions: The presented MELSCI system allows for real-time acquisition and calculation of high-quality perfusion at 15.6 frames per second. (C) The Authors.

The real-time recording of death certificates, thanks to Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS), provides valuable data for reactive mortality surveillance based on medical causes of death in free-text format. Reactive mortality surveillance is based on the monitoring of mortality syndromic groups (MSGs). An MSG is a cluster of medical causes of death (pathologies, syndromes or symptoms) that meets the objectives of early detection and impact assessment of public health events. The aim of this study is to implement and measure the performance of a rule-based method and two supervised models for automatic free-text cause of death classification from death certificates in order to implement them for routine surveillance.METHOD: A rule-based method was implemented using four processing steps: standardization rules, splitting causes of death using delimiters, spelling corrections and dictionary projection. A supervised machine learning method using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was also implemented. Two models were produced using different features (SVM1 based solely on surface features and SVM2 combining surface features and MSGs classified by the rule-based method as feature vectors). The evaluation was conducted using an annotated subset of electronic death certificates received between 2012 and 2016. Classification performance was evaluated on seven MSGs (Influenza, Low respiratory diseases, Asphyxia/abnormal respiration, Acute respiratory disease, Sepsis, Chronic digestive diseases, and Chronic endocrine diseases).RESULTS: The rule-based method and the SVM2 model displayed a high performance with F-measures over 0.94 for all MSGs. Precision and recall were slightly higher for the rule-based method and the SVM2 model. An error-analysis shows that errors were not specific to an MSG.CONCLUSION: The high performance of the rule-based method and SVM2 model will allow us to set-up a reactive mortality surveillance system based on free-text death certificates.

STARLINER aimed to characterise disease behaviour in patients with suspected ILD during the peri-diagnostic period using real-time home-based assessments. Methods: STARLINER (NCT03261037) was an international, multicentre study. Patients ≥ 50 years old with suspected ILD were followed throughout the peri-diagnostic period, consisting of a pre-diagnostic period (from enrolment to diagnosis) and a post-diagnostic period (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Study length was variable (≤ 18 months). The primary endpoint was time-adjusted semi-annual forced vital capacity (FVC) change measured during the peri-diagnostic period using daily home spirometry in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Secondary outcomes included changes in FVC (home spirometry) in patients with non-IPF ILD, changes in FVC (site spirometry), changes in physical functional capacity measured by daily home accelerometry and site 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IPF or non-IPF ILD. Results: Of the 178 patients enrolled in the study, 68 patients were diagnosed with IPF, 62 patients were diagnosed with non-IPF ILD, 9 patients received a non-ILD diagnosis and 39 patients did not receive a diagnosis. Technical and analytical issues led to problems in applying the prespecified linear regression model to analyse the home FVC data. Time-adjusted median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) semi-annual FVC change during the peri-diagnostic period measured using home and site spirometry, respectively, was – 147.7 (– 723.8, 376.2) ml and – 149.0 (– 314.6, 163.9) ml for IPF and 19.1 (– 194.9, 519.0) ml and – 23.4 (– 117.9, 133.5) ml in non-IPF ILD. A greater decline in steps per day was observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD, whereas an increase in 6MWD was observed for patients with IPF versus a decline in 6MWD for patients with non-IPF ILD. No clear patterns of disease behaviour were observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD for PROs. Conclusions: Despite home spirometry being feasible for most patients and centres, technical and analytical challenges in the home-based assessments prevented firm conclusions regarding disease behaviour.

387260665,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Complex tasks such as classifying and segmenting medical images and localising and recognising objects of interest have become much less challenging. This progress has the potential of accelerating research and deployment of multitudes of medical applications that utilise CV. However, in reality, there are limited practical examples being physically deployed into front-line health facilities. In this paper, we examine the current state of the art in CV as applied to the medical domain. We discuss the main challenges in CV and intelligent data-driven medical applications and suggest future directions to accelerate research, development, and deployment of CV applications in health practices. First, we critically review existing literature in the CV domain that addresses complex vision tasks, including: medical image classification; shape and object recognition from images; and medical segmentation. Second, we present an in-depth discussion of the various challenges that are considered barriers to accelerating research, development, and deployment of intelligent CV methods in real-life medical applications and hospitals.

Together with the function of the newly infected individualsI, this model allows us to predict the evolution of the resulting epidemic process in terms of the numberEof the death patients plus individuals who have overcome the disease. Our model has as a starting point the representation ofEas the convolution ofIandP. It allows introducing information about latent patients-patients who have already been cured but are still potentially infectious, and re-infected individuals. We also provide three methods for the estimation ofPusing real data, all of them based on the minimization of the quadratic error: the exact solution using the associated Lagrangian function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, a Monte Carlo computational scheme acting on the total set of local minima, and a genetic algorithm for the approximation of the global minima. Although the calculation of the exact solutions of all the linear systems provided by the use of the Lagrangian naturally gives the best optimization result, the huge number of such systems that appear when the time variable increases makes it necessary to use numerical methods. We have chosen the genetic algorithms. Indeed, we show that the results obtained in this way provide good solutions for the model.This research was funded by Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades: MTM2016-77054-C2-1-P and Generalitat Valenciana: Catedra de Transparencia y Gestion de Datos (U.P.V.).

305118535,2020-04-01T00:00:00,"Real-world epidemiology gives us the unique opportunity to observe large numbers of people, and the actions and events that characterize their encounters with healthcare providers. However, the heterogeneity and sheer diversity of the population and healthcare systems makes it impossible for researchers to compare “like with like” when attempting to draw causal inferences about interventions and outcomes. The critical issue in epidemiological datasets relates to high risk of bias due to confounders that stem from baseline differences between groups. Propensity score (PS) techniques are statistical approaches that have been used to tackle potential imbalance in the comparison groups. The PS is the estimated probability (based on measured baseline covariates) that the patient receives a particular intervention. Patients that share similar PS will most likely have the same distributions of underlying covariates included in the PS. Implementation of PS methods may achieve better balance of covariates, but there is no consensus on the best way of capturing all relevant confounders for incorporation into the PS model. Should covariates be selected by clinical or epidemiological experts, or would data-driven algorithms (machine learning) offer more efficient and reliable methods of estimating PS and controlling for confounding? The PS can be incorporated into the analysis in different ways, each with its own strengths and limitations, and researchers must choose the best fit for their study objectives.

This article identifies four design principles to address this challenge and applies them in a real-world implementation: cloud-based robot control, a modular design, one common knowledge base for all applications, and hybrid artificial intelligence for decision making and reasoning. The control architecture for this robot includes a common Knowledge-base (ontologies), Data-base, “Hybrid Artificial Brain” (dialogue manager, action selection and explainable AI), Activities Centre (Timeline, Quiz, Break and Sort, Memory, Tip of the Day, ), Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA, i.e., robot and avatar), and Dashboards (for authoring and monitoring the interaction). Further, the ECA is integrated with an expandable set of (mobile) health applications.

Various distance metrics were tried for obtaining clinically relevant search results. With the use of R programming language, we designed the first version of the system in approximately a week. A set of features for the comparison of the cases was selected with the use of random forest algorithm implemented in Caret.

In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations.

481177708,2021-10-02T00:00:00,"International audienceBackground: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular-omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods: The European ""ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)"" consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results: This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the ""ITFoC Challenge"". This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets. Conclusions: The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings.

483816328,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background
Uncertainty in patients' COVID-19 status contributes to treatment delays, nosocomial transmission, and operational pressures in hospitals. However, the typical turnaround time for laboratory PCR remains 12–24 h and lateral flow devices (LFDs) have limited sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that artificial intelligence-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) can provide rapid COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1 h of arrival to hospital. Here, we aimed to improve the time from arrival to the emergency department to the availability of a result, do external and prospective validation, and deploy a novel laboratory-free screening tool in a UK emergency department.
Methods
We optimised our previous model, removing less informative predictors to improve generalisability and speed, developing the CURIAL-Lab model with vital signs and readily available blood tests (full blood count [FBC]; urea, creatinine, and electrolytes; liver function tests; and C-reactive protein) and the CURIAL-Rapide model with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were validated externally for emergency admissions to University Hospitals Birmingham, Bedfordshire Hospitals, and Portsmouth Hospitals University National Health Service (NHS) trusts, and prospectively at Oxford University Hospitals, by comparison with PCR testing. Next, we compared model performance directly against LFDs and evaluated a combined pathway that triaged patients who had either a positive CURIAL model result or a positive LFD to a COVID-19-suspected clinical area. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser to provide laboratory-free COVID-19 screening at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK). Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result, and our performance measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
Findings
72 223 patients met eligibility criteria across the four validating hospital groups, in a total validation period spanning Dec 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. CURIAL-Lab and CURIAL-Rapide performed consistently across trusts (AUROC range 0·858–0·881, 95% CI 0·838–0·912, for CURIAL-Lab and 0·836–0·854, 0·814–0·889, for CURIAL-Rapide), achieving highest sensitivity at Portsmouth Hospitals (84·1%, Wilson's 95% CI 82·5–85·7, for CURIAL-Lab and 83·5%, 81·8–85·1, for CURIAL-Rapide) at specificities of 71·3% (70·9–71·8) for CURIAL-Lab and 63·6% (63·1–64·1) for CURIAL-Rapide. When combined with LFDs, model predictions improved triage sensitivity from 56·9% (51·7–62·0) for LFDs alone to 85·6% with CURIAL-Lab (81·6–88·9; AUROC 0·925) and 88·2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84·4–91·1; AUROC 0·919), thereby reducing missed COVID-19 cases by 65% with CURIAL-Lab and 72% with CURIAL-Rapide. For the prospective deployment of CURIAL-Rapide, 520 patients were enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between Feb 18 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing and ten (2·3%) tested positive. Median time from arrival to a CURIAL-Rapide result was 45 min (IQR 32–64), 16 min (26·3%) sooner than with LFDs (61 min, 37–99; log-rank p<0·0001), and 6 h 52 min (90·2%) sooner than with PCR (7 h 37 min, 6 h 5 min to 15 h 39 min; p<0·0001). Classification performance was high, with sensitivity of 87·5% (95% CI 52·9–97·8), specificity of 85·4% (81·3–88·7), and negative predictive value of 99·7% (98·2–99·9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded infection for 31 (58·5%) of 53 patients who were triaged by a physician to a COVID-19-suspected area but went on to test negative by PCR.
Interpretation
Our findings show the generalisability, performance, and real-world operational benefits of artificial intelligence-driven screening for COVID-19 over standard-of-care in emergency departments.

 Methods:  A retrospective study of 759 ICU patients was conducted between January 2013 and July 2015. A character-level gated recurrent unit with a Weibull distribution algorithm was used to develop a real-time prediction model. Fivefold cross-validation testing (training set: 80% and validation set: 20%) determined the consistency of model accuracy. The time-dependent area under the curve (TAUC) was analyzed based on the aggregation of 5 validation sets. 

 Results:  The TAUCs of the implemented model were 0.963, 0.942, 0.917, 0.875, 0.850, 0.842, and 0.761 before cardiac arrest at 1, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 hours, respectively. The sensitivity was between 0.846 and 0.909, and specificity was between 0.923 and 0.946. The distribution of risk between the cardiac arrest group and the non-cardiac arrest group was generally different, and the difference rapidly increased as the time left until cardiac arrest reduced. 

 Conclusions:  A deep learning model for forecasting cardiac arrest was implemented and tested by considering the cumulative and fluctuating effects of time-dependent clinical data gathered from a large medical center. This real-time prediction model is expected to improve patient's care by allowing early intervention in patients at high risk of unexpected cardiac arrests.ope",'JMIR Publications Inc.',Development of a Real-Time Risk Prediction Model for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Critically Ill Patients Using Deep Learning: Retrospective Study,10.2196/16349,https://core.ac.uk/download/481637846.pdf,"[{'title': 'JMIR Medical Informatics', 'identifiers': ['2291-9694', 'issn:2291-9694']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322656794,2019-10-20T00:00:00,"[EN] Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

390020643,2019-07-30T00:00:00,"The economic-legal analysis of the state and trends of the development of technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) has been carried out. The influence of AI on the development of society, eco­nomic effect, methods and the field of application, the state of developments in the world and Ukraine are analyzed. In the next decade, AI will become the main mar­ket trend and the best business tool. The contribution of intellectual technologies to global GDP is estimated at 15.7 trillion. dollars In the next 5-10 years, China will be the leader in the successful operation and adaptation of AI technologies. Ac­cording to analysts, the most benefit from AI technologies will be in the areas of fi­nancial services, retail and medicine.The scientific and inventive activity in the sphere of AI, the role of protection of in­tellectual property (patent and copyright), and the maintenance of the balance of com­peting interests are researched. Recently, the number of inventions based on AI has sharply increased. The leaders in the number of such inventions are American compa­nies IBM and Microsoft. This growth is due to the fact that in recent years AI has evolved from the theoretical concept into a real product that gains the world market. Since the advent of AI in the 50’s of the last century, inventors and researchers have applied for almost 340 thousand inventions based on AI (as of the end of 2016) and published more than 1.6 million scientific articles. The transport sector, including au­tonomous vehicles, is one of the sectors with the highest rates of growth in the appli­cation of AI. China has become a global leader in increasing the number of patents in the AI sphere over the past five years.By the number of companies working in the sphere of AI, Ukraine is among the three leaders among the countries of Eastern Europe.

Abdominal cancer is a widely prevalent group of tumours with a high level of mortality if diagnosed at a late stage. Although the cancer death rates have in general declined over the past few decades, the mortality from tumours in the hepatoduodenal area has significantly increased in recent years. The broader use of minimal access surgery (MAS) for diagnostics and treatment can significantly improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients after surgery. This work aims to develop and characterise an appropriate technical implementation for tissue endogenous fluorescence (TEF) and assess the efficiency of machine learning methods for the real-time diagnosis of tumours in the hepatoduodenal area. In this paper, we present the results of the machine learning approach applied to the optically guided MAS. We have elaborated tissue fluorescence approach with a fibre-optic probe to record the TEF and blood perfusion parameters during MAS in patients with cancers in the hepatoduodenal area. The measurements from the laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) channel were used as a sensor of the tissue vitality to reduce variability in TEF data. Also, we evaluated how the blood perfusion oscillations are changed in the tumour tissue. The evaluated amplitudes of the cardiac (0.6–1.6 Hz) and respiratory (0.2–0.6 Hz) oscillations was significantly higher in intact tissues (p %lt; 0.001) compared to the cancerous ones, while the myogenic (0.2–0.06 Hz) oscillation did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference. Our results demonstrate that a fibre-optic TEF probe accompanied with ML algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbours or AdaBoost is highly promising for the real-time in situ differentiation between cancerous and healthy tissues by detecting the information about the tissue type that is encoded in the fluorescence spectrum. Also, we show that the detection can be supplemented and enhanced by parallel collection and classification of blood perfusion oscillations",Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Machine learning aided photonic diagnostic system for minimally invasive optically guided surgery in the hepatoduodenal area,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
442071865,2021-03-01T00:00:00,"BackgroundImmunohistochemistry (IHC) remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of pathological diseases. This technique has been supporting pathologists in making precise decisions regarding differential diagnosis and subtyping, and in creating personalized treatment plans. However, the interpretation of IHC results presents challenges in complicated cases. Furthermore, rapidly increasing amounts of IHC data are making it even harder for pathologists to reach to definitive conclusions.MethodsWe developed ImmunoGenius, a machine-learning-based expert system for the pathologist, to support the diagnosis of tumors of unknown origin. Based on Bayesian theorem, the most probable diagnoses can be drawn by calculating the probabilities of the IHC results in each disease. We prepared IHC profile data of 584 antibodies in 2009 neoplasms based on the relevant textbooks. We developed the reactive native mobile application for iOS and Android platform that can provide 10 most possible differential diagnoses based on the IHC input.ResultsWe trained the software using 562 real case data, validated it with 382 case data, tested it with 164 case data and compared the precision hit rate. Precision hit rate was 78.5, 78.0 and 89.0% in training, validation and test dataset respectively. Which showed no significant difference. The main reason for discordant precision was lack of disease-specific IHC markers and overlapping IHC profiles observed in similar diseases.ConclusionThe results of this study showed a potential that the machine-learning algorithm based expert system can support the pathologic diagnosis by providing second opinion on IHC interpretation based on IHC database. Incorporation with contextual data including the clinical and histological findings might be required to elaborate the system in the future.11Nsciescopu",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"Diagnosis prediction of tumours of unknown origin using ImmunoGenius, a machine learning-based expert system for immunohistochemistry profile interpretation",10.1186/s13000-021-01081-8,,"[{'title': 'Diagnostic Pathology', 'identifiers': ['1746-1596', 'issn:1746-1596']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429990396,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system. Its diagnosis nowadays commonly includes performing an MRI scan, as it is the most sensitive imaging test for MS. MS plaques are commonly identified from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images as hyperintense regions that are highly varying in terms of their shapes, sizes and locations, and are routinely classified in accordance to the McDonald criteria. Recent years have seen an increase in works that aimed at development of various semi-automatic and automatic methods for detection, segmentation and classification of MS plaques. In this paper, we present an automatic combined method, based on two pipelines: a traditional unsupervised machine learning technique and a deep-learning attention-gate 3D U-net network. The deep-learning network is specifically trained to address the weaker points of the traditional approach, namely difficulties in segmenting infratentorial and juxtacortical plaques in real-world clinical MRIs. It was trained and validated on a multi-center multi-scanner dataset that contains 159 cases, each with T1 weighted (T1w) and FLAIR images, as well as manual delineations of the MS plaques, segmented and validated by a panel of raters. The detection rate was quantified using lesion-wise Dice score. A simple label fusion is implemented to combine the output segmentations of the two pipelines. This combined method improves the detection of infratentorial and juxtacortical lesions by 14% and 31% respectively, in comparison to the unsupervised machine learning pipeline that was used as a performance assessment baseline",'Elsevier BV',icobrain ms 5.1: Combining unsupervised and supervised approaches for improving the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions,10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102707,,"[{'title': 'NeuroImage Clinical', 'identifiers': ['2213-1582', 'issn:2213-1582']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed.

370074707,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The high capacity of neural networks allows fitting models to data with high precision, but makes generalization to unseen data a challenge. If a domain shift exists, i.e. differences in image statistics between training and test data, care needs to be taken to ensure reliable deployment in real-world scenarios. In digital pathology, domain shift can be manifested in differences between whole-slide images, introduced by for example differences in acquisition pipeline - between medical centers or over time. In order to harness the great potential presented by deep learning in histopathology, and ensure consistent model behavior, we need a deeper understanding of domain shift and its consequences, such that a model's predictions on new data can be trusted. This work focuses on the internal representation learned by trained convolutional neural networks, and shows how this can be used to formulate a novel measure - the representation shift - for quantifying the magnitude of model specific domain shift. We perform a study on domain shift in tumor classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained images, by considering different datasets, models, and techniques for preparing data in order to reduce the domain shift. The results show how the proposed measure has a high correlation with drop in performance when testing a model across a large number of different types of domain shifts, and how it improves on existing techniques for measuring data shift and uncertainty. The proposed measure can reveal how sensitive a model is to domain variations, and can be used to detect new data that a model will have problems generalizing to. We see techniques for measuring, understanding and overcoming the domain shift as a crucial step towards reliable use of deep learning in the future clinical pathology applications",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Measuring Domain Shift for Deep Learning in Histopathology,10.1109/JBHI.2020.3032060,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this device, a patterned mesoporous nickel vanadate hollow-nanospheres modified chitosan (Ch-Ni3V2O8) was integrated with microfluidic structure. With excellent redox activity and biocompatibility, larger surface, tunable oxidation states (V5+, V4+, and V3+), the Ch-Ni3V2O8 matrix was used to functionalize the cardiac antibodies of troponin I (cAb) and amplify the electrochemical readouts. This device offered a high sensitivity of 38.88 µA/ng mL-1/cm2 for a wide range of cTnI concentration (0.005‒100 ng mL‒1). A low limit-of-detection of 5 pg mL‒1 and high stability, high reproducibility and good selectivity were achieved due to integration of microfluidic elements with hollow-nanosphere Ch-Ni3V2O8.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones.

This manuscript represents an official Position Statement of the ESGE aiming to define simple, safe, and easy-to-measure competence standards for endoscopists and artificial intelligence systems performing optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps (1 - 5 mm). METHODS : A panel of European experts in optical diagnosis participated in a modified Delphi process to reach consensus on Simple Optical Diagnosis Accuracy (SODA) competence standards for implementation of the optical diagnosis strategy for diminutive colorectal polyps. In order to assess the clinical benefits and harms of implementing optical diagnosis with different competence standards, a systematic literature search was performed. This was complemented with the results from a recently performed simulation study that provides guidance for setting alternative competence standards for optical diagnosis. Proposed competence standards were based on literature search and simulation study results. Competence standards were accepted if at least 80 % agreement was reached after a maximum of three voting rounds. RECOMMENDATION 1:  In order to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive colorectal lesions (1-5 mm), it is clinically acceptable if, during real-time colonoscopy, at least 90 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity is achieved for high confidence endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia of 1-5 mm in the rectosigmoid.

This talk describes the development of a prototype automated image guidance system, combining high-refresh-rate, volumetric ultrasound (US) imaging (or 4D US) and advanced deep learning strategies for an autonomous robotic platform, currently being investigated for knee surgery. The feasibility of using 4D US for guidance in knee minimally invasive surgery was first proved through cadaver and volunteer studies. The workflow to enable automatic interpretation of 4D US imaging for robotic guidance was then developed and implemented. The essential steps include automatic image quality assessment, tissue segmentation and tracking (in combination with the assessment of uncertainties) and surgical tool tracking. The results obtained show US imaging's potential for quantitative autonomous tasks and for the creation of autonomous, intelligent robotic surgical systems that will hopefully soon make surgery more sustainable and improve people's quality of life.Learning Objectives:1. US imaging combined with deep learning strategies can provide a solution for real-time volumetric guidance for autonomous systems;2.

299968308,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Intracranial hemorrhage is a medical emergency that requires urgent diagnosis and immediate treatment to improve patient outcome. Machine learning algorithms can be used to perform medical image classification and assist clinicians in diagnosing radiological scans. In this paper, we apply 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) to classify computed tomography (CT) brain scans into normal scans (N) and abnormal scans containing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), acute subdural hemorrhage (ASDH) and brain polytrauma hemorrhage (BPH). The dataset used consists of 399 volumetric CT brain images representing approximately 12,000 images from the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. We used a 3D CNN to perform both 2-class (normal versus a specific abnormal class) and 4-class classification (between normal, SAH, IPH, ASDH). We apply image thresholding at the image pre-processing step, that improves 3D CNN classification accuracy and performance by accentuating the pixel intensities that contribute most to feature discrimination. For 2-class classification, the F1 scores for various pairs of medical diagnoses ranged from 0.706 to 0.902 without thresholding. With thresholding implemented, the F1 scores improved and ranged from 0.919 to 0.952. Our results are comparable to, and in some cases, exceed the results published in other work applying 3D CNN to CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan classification.

This paper discusses how an ""open science"" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing.

226908814,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceManufacturing companies are under a constant pressure due to multiple factors: new competition, disruptive innovations, cost reduction request, etc. To survive, they must strive to innovate and adapt their business model to improve their productivity. Recent developments based on the concept of Industry 4.0 such as big data, new communication protocols and artificial intelligence provide several new avenues to explore. In the specific context of machining, we are working toward the development of a system capable of making the prognostic of the quality (in terms of dimensional conformance) of a workpiece in real time while it is being manufactured. The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms. In the end, this paper depicts the system architecture as well as its interactions between the multiple systems and software already in place at our industrial partner. This paper also shows preliminary results describing the relationship between the workpiece quality (in terms of respect toward the dimensional requirements) and the extracted features from the sensors signals. We conclude that it is now possible to do the diagnostic of a cutting operation. Additionally, with the same information we show that it is possible to quickly do the general diagnostic of the health state of the machine.

365584409,2019-11-07T00:00:00,"Purpose

Recently, several attempts were conducted to transfer deep learning to medical image reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a result, many approaches use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable problems.





Methods

PYRO‐NN is a generalized framework to embed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow. The current status includes state‐of‐the‐art parallel‐, fan‐, and cone‐beam projectors, and back‐projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow layers. On top, the framework provides a high‐level Python API to conduct FBP and iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems.





Results

The framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to design end‐to‐end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction algorithms. The high‐level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as known from Tensorflow. All algorithms and tools are referenced to a scientific publication and are compared to existing non‐deep learning reconstruction frameworks. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, the framework comes with baseline experiments, which are described in the supplementary material. The framework is available as open‐source software under the Apache 2.0 licence at https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN.





Conclusions

PYRO‐NN comes with the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end‐to‐end trainable neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We believe that the framework will be a step toward reproducible research and give the medical physics community a toolkit to elevate medical image reconstruction with new deep learning techniques",'Wiley',Technical Note: PYRO‐NN: Python reconstruction operators in neural networks,10.1002/mp.13753,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490584732,2021-12-21T00:00:00,"The discipline of remote working has been characterized from the beginning by a significant participatory presence in collective bargaining, from the European Framework Agreement on Telework of 2002, to its national implementation within the Interconfederal Agreement of 2004, passing through the propulsive role that the bargaining, especially that within the company realities, had regarding the preparatory work that led to the enactment of the law 22 May 2017, n. 81 about the “smart working”. This role could also affect the reform of the discipline, made indispensable because the wide appeal that the agile type, also known as «smart working» anglicism, has had due to the spread of SARS-CoV-19. It is precisely the experimentation throughout the national territory that has rekindled the debate on the subject and stimulated bargaining again with the aim of regulating a «method of execution of the employment relationship» (Article 18, l. 81/2017) which seems to have become an integral part of the current and future organization of work. This contribution aims to investigate the first solutions born in corporate bargaining. The fil rouge that binds the 25 company agreements – selected for the innovativeness of the solutions adopted, for the completeness of the discipline or for the occupational relevance – is the intent to regulate, considering the peculiarities of the workers in force in the individual companies, not simplified smart working, and that is the one that should be resorted when the health emergency will be over – indeed already practiced by someone. Three topical study topics for post-emergency labour law have been identified: access to agile mode, workplace safety and working time flexibility. With respect to the first profile, corporate collective bargaining has expanded the number of workers with priority access to this remote working method, recognizing real rights to smart working in favour of some categories. With respect to the second profile, the agreements have more or less strictly limited the freedom of the agile worker to choose the workplace independently, also with the aim of limiting the employer’s responsibility for health and safety in the workplace, the perimeter of which does not appear sufficiently clear in line with the doctrinal debate on the subject. With respect to the third profile, the contractual practice examined has kept normal working time firm, while variously developing the possibility of placing it flexibly within the working day, abdicating instead the task of fully defining the right to disconnect and, therefore, suitable and mandatory «technical and organizational measures».La disciplina de los casos de teletrabajo se ha caracterizado desde el principio por una importante presencia participativa en la negociación colectiva, desde el Acuerdo Marco Europeo sobre Teletrabajo de 2002, hasta su implementación nacional dentro del Acuerdo Interconfederal de 2004, pasando por el papel propulsor que la negociación, especialmente que dentro de las realidades de la empresa, con respecto al trabajo preparatorio que condujo a la promulgación de la ley 22 de mayo de 2017 n. 81 sobre el trabajo ágil y que también podría afectar la reforma de la disciplina, indispensable a raíz del amplio atractivo que ha tenido el tipo ágil, también conocido con el anglicismo «smart working», debido a la propagación del SARS-CoV-19. Es precisamente la experimentación que tuvo lugar en todo el territorio nacional la que ha reavivado el debate sobre el tema y ha estimulado nuevamente la negociación con el objetivo de regular un «método de ejecución de la relación laboral» (artículo 18 de la l. 81/2017), que parece haberse convertido en parte integrante de la organización del trabajo actual y futura. Esta contribución tiene como objetivo investigar las primeras soluciones nacidas de la negociación de proximidad. El fil rouge que une los 25 convenios de empresa - seleccionados por la innovación de las soluciones adoptadas, por la integridad de la disciplina o por la relevancia ocupacional - es la intención de regular, considerando las peculiaridades de los trabajadores vigentes en las empresas individuales, el smart working no simplificado, y que es lo que se utilizará cuando la emergencia sanitaria haya pasada - de hecho ya lo practican algunos. Se han identificado tres temas de estudio de actualidad para la legislación laboral posterior a emergencias: acceso al modo ágil, seguridad en el lugar de trabajo y flexibilidad horaria. En comparación con el primer perfil, la negociación colectiva corporativa ha ampliado el número de trabajadores con acceso prioritario a este método de trabajo a distancia, reconociendo derechos reales al trabajo inteligente a favor de algunas categorías. Con respecto al segundo perfil, los acuerdos han limitado más o menos estrictamente la libertad del trabajador ágil para elegir el lugar de trabajo, también con el objetivo de limitar la responsabilidad del empleador en la salud y seguridad en el lugar de trabajo, que no parece suficientemente claro en consonancia con el debate doctrinal sobre el tema. En comparación con el tercer perfil, la práctica contractual examinada ha mantenido firme el horario normal, al tiempo que desarrolló de diversas maneras la posibilidad de ubicarlo en manera flexible dentro de la jornada laboral, abdicando en cambio de la tarea de definir plenamente el derecho a desconectarse y, por lo tanto, la idoneidad y obligatoriedad de «técnicas y medidas organizativas»La disciplina delle fattispecie di lavoro da remoto è stata sin ab origine contraddistinta da una significativa presenza partecipativa della contrattazione collettiva, dall’Accordo Quadro Europeo sul Telelavoro del 2002, al suo recepimento nazionale all’interno dell’Accordo Interconfederale del 2004, passando per il ruolo propulsivo che la contrattazione, specie quella in seno alle realtà aziendali, ha avuto rispetto ai lavori preparatori che hanno condotto all’emanazione della legge 22 maggio 2017 n. 81 sul lavoro agile e che potrebbe altresì influire sulla riforma della disciplina, resa indispensabile a seguito dell’ampio ricorso che la fattispecie agile, nota anche con l’anglicismo «smart working», ha avuto a causa della diffusione del SARS-CoV-19.
È proprio la sperimentazione avutasi sull’intero territorio nazionale che ha riacceso il dibattito in materia e stimolato nuovamente la contrattazione con l’intento di regolare una «modalità di esecuzione del rapporto di lavoro subordinato» (art. 18 l. n. 81/2017), che pare sia divenuta parte integrante dell’attuale e futura organizzazione del lavoro. Il presente contributo si propone di indagare le prime soluzioni nate in seno alla contrattazione aziendale. Il fil rouge che lega i 25 accordi aziendali – selezionati per l’innovatività delle soluzioni adottate, per la completezza della disciplina o per la rilevanza occupazionale – è l’intento di regolare, considerando le peculiarità dei lavoratori in forza nelle singole realtà aziendali, lo smart working non semplificato, e cioè quello a cui si dovrebbe ricorrere ad emergenza sanitaria conclusa – invero già da alcuni praticato.
Sono stati enucleati tre temi di studio di attualità per il diritto del lavoro post-emergenziale: l’accesso alla modalità agile, la sicurezza sul luogo di lavoro e la flessibilità oraria. Rispetto al primo profilo, la contrattazione collettiva aziendale ha ampliato la platea dei lavoratori aventi accesso prioritario a tale modalità di lavoro da remoto, riconoscendo in favore di alcune categorie veri e propri diritti allo smart working. Rispetto al secondo profilo, gli accordi hanno circoscritto in maniera più o meno stringente la libertà del lavoratore agile di scegliere autonomamente il luogo di lavoro, anche con l’intento di limitare la responsabilità del datore di lavoro in materia di salute e sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro, il cui perimetro non appare sufficientemente chiaro in linea con il dibattito dottrinale in materia. Rispetto al terzo profilo, la prassi contrattuale esaminata ha mantenuto fermo l’orario normale, pur sviluppando variamente la possibilità di collocarlo in maniera flessibile all’interno della giornata lavorativa, abdicando invece al compito di definire compiutamente il diritto alla disconnessione e, dunque, «misure tecniche e organizzative» idonee e cogenti",Dipartimento di Scienze Giuridiche.

333919275,2020-04-28T00:00:00,"International audienceBackground: High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota.Methods: Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results.Results: AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3-11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa.Conclusion: Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa. For fungal analysis, ITS2 allowed the detection of a greater number of minor taxa compared with ITS1",'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?,10.1371/journal.pone.0232215,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Learn from the advantages and disadvantages of the thermodynamic model based and data-driven artificial intelligence based gas-path diagnosis methods, a newfangled gas turbine gas-path diagnosis approach on the basis of knowledge data-driven artificial intelligence is proposed. That is a hybrid method of deep learning and gas path analysis. First, gas turbine thermodynamic model of the object to be diagnosed is constructed by adaptation modeling strategy. And the engine thermodynamic model is taken as the basal model to simulate various gas path faults. Secondly, a large number of knowledge data corresponding to component health parameters and gas turbine boundary condition parameters &#x0026; gas-path measurable parameters are simulated by setting different component health parameter values and different boundary conditions based on this basal model. And next, define the vector composed of the boundary condition parameters &#x0026; the gas path measurable parameters in the knowledge database as the input vector, and the component health parameter vector as the output vector, and a deep learning model for regression modeling of this knowledge database is designed. At last, along with the gas turbine engine runs, the trained model outputs component health parameters in real time after trained deep learning model is deployed to the corresponding gas turbine power plant. The simulation experiment results show that, accurate and quantified health parameters of each gas path component can be obtained by the proposed method in this paper, and the overall root mean square error does not exceed 0.033&#x0025;, and the maximum relative error does not exceed 0.36&#x0025;, which illustrates the proposed method has great application potential",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Gas Path Fault Diagnosis of Gas Turbine Engine Based on Knowledge Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence Algorithm,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101647,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R).

426867658,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments",'MDPI AG',BCNDataset: Description and Analysis of an Annotated Night Urban Leisure Sound Dataset,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490938445,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Among various medical imaging tools, chest radiographs are the most important and widely used diagnostic tool for the detection of thoracic pathologies. Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87&#x0025; for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21&#x0025; for localization of pneumothorax. Thus, the outstanding abilities of deep learning techniques can be deployed for developing robust models for pneumothorax detection",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Automatic Diagnosis of Pneumothorax From Chest Radiographs: A Systematic Literature Review,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3122998,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491003984,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Background The aim of the present paper is to construct an emulator of a complex biological system simulator using a machine learning approach. More specifically, the simulator is a patient-specific model that integrates metabolic, nutritional, and lifestyle data to predict the metabolic and inflammatory processes underlying the development of type-2 diabetes in absence of familiarity. Given the very high incidence of type-2 diabetes, the implementation of this predictive model on mobile devices could provide a useful instrument to assess the risk of the disease for aware individuals. The high computational cost of the developed model, being a mixture of agent-based and ordinary differential equations and providing a dynamic multivariate output, makes the simulator executable only on powerful workstations but not on mobile devices. Hence the need to implement an emulator with a reduced computational cost that can be executed on mobile devices to provide real-time self-monitoring. Results Similarly to our previous work, we propose an emulator based on a machine learning algorithm but here we consider a different approach which turn out to have better performances, indeed in terms of root mean square error we have an improvement of two order magnitude. We tested the proposed emulator on samples containing different number of simulated trajectories, and it turned out that the fitted trajectories are able to predict with high accuracy the entire dynamics of the simulator output variables. We apply the emulator to control the level of inflammation while leveraging on the nutritional input. Conclusion The proposed emulator can be implemented and executed on mobile health devices to perform quick-and-easy self-monitoring assessments",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Emulating complex simulations by machine learning methods,10.1186/s12859-021-04354-7,,"[{'title': 'BMC Bioinformatics', 'identifiers': ['1471-2105', 'issn:1471-2105']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491037081,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Since consuming gutter oil does great harm to people’s health, the Food Safety Administration has always been seeking for a more effective and timely supervision. As laboratory tests consume much time, and existing field tests have excessive limitations, a more comprehensive method is in great need. This is the first time a study proposes machine learning algorithms for real-time gutter oil detection under multiple feature dimensions. Moreover, it is deployed on FPGA to be low-power and portable for actual use. Firstly, a variety of oil samples are generated by simulating the real detection environment. Next, based on previous studies, sensors are used to collect significant features that help distinguish gutter oil. Then, the acquired features are filtered and compared using a variety of classifiers. The best classification result is obtained by k-NN with an accuracy of 97.18%, and the algorithm is deployed to FPGA with no significant loss of accuracy. Power consumption is further reduced with the approximate multiplier we designed. Finally, the experimental results show that compared with all other platforms, the whole FPGA-based classification process consumes 4.77 µs and the power consumption is 65.62 mW.

deep learning model to classify the hand gestures of the sign language digits. The proposed deep
learning model is based on the bottleneck module which is inspired by the deep residual networks.
The model achieves classification accuracy of 99.1% on the publicly available sign language digits
dataset. The model is deployed on a Raspberry pi 4 Model B edge computing system to serve as an
edge device for user verification. The edge computing system consists of two steps, it first takes input
from the camera attached to it in real-time and stores it in the buffer. In the second step, the model
classifies the digit with the inference rate of 280 ms, by taking the first image in the buffer as input.publishedVersio",'MDPI AG',Design and Implementation of Deep Learning Based Contactless Authentication System Using Hand Gestures,10.3390/electronics10020182,https://core.ac.uk/download/523305217.pdf,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
475070866,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Multi-class classification is one of the major challenges in machine learning and an ongoing research issue. Classification algorithms are generally binary, but they must be extended to multi-class problems for real-world application. Multi-class classification is more complex than binary classification. In binary classification, only the decision boundaries of one class are to be known, whereas in multiclass classification, several boundaries are involved. The objective of this investigation is to propose a metaheuristic, optimized, multi-level classification learning system for forecasting in civil and construction engineering. The proposed system integrates the firefly algorithm (FA), metaheuristic intelligence, decomposition approaches, the one-against-one (OAO) method, and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). The enhanced FA automatically fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the LSSVM to construct an optimized LSSVM classification model. Ten benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of the enhanced optimization algorithm. Two binary-class datasets related to geotechnical engineering, concerning seismic bumps and soil liquefaction, are then used to clarify the application of the proposed system to binary problems. Further, this investigation uses multi-class cases in civil engineering and construction management to verify the effectiveness of the model in the diagnosis of faults in steel plates, quality of water in a reservoir, and determining urban land cover. The results reveal that the system predicts faults in steel plates with an accuracy of 91.085%, the quality of water in a reservoir with an accuracy of 93.650%, and urban land cover with an accuracy of 87.274%. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, its predictive accuracy is compared with that of a non-optimized baseline model, single multi-class classification algorithms (sequential minimal optimization (SMO), the Multiclass Classifier, the Naïve Bayes, the library support vector machine (LibSVM) and logistic regression) and prior studies.

440978332,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND:High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota. METHODS:Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results. RESULTS:AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3-11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa. CONCLUSION:Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa. For fungal analysis, ITS2 allowed the detection of a greater number of minor taxa compared with ITS1",'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?,10.1371/journal.pone.0232215,,"[{'title': 'PLoS ONE', 'identifiers': ['issn:1932-6203', '1932-6203']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an acute-phase protein that plays a key role in the innate immunity defence against infectious disease. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the MBL serum level and the relative expression of MBL mRNA in RVVC using real-time PCR for the first time. The case-control study included 40 female participants suffering from RVVC and 40 healthy individuals. The MBL serum level was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. The relative mRNA expression of the MBL gene was quantified using real-time PCR. Data analysis was carried out by spss software. The MBL concentration was significantly higher in the participants suffering from RVVC compared to the control group (0.330Â ng/mL vs 0.253Â ng/mL). The prognostic value (PÂ <.001) for RVVC diagnosis has been calculated. Quantitative RT-PCR results from 35 samples showed a low to significant values for mRNA levels corresponding to MBL gene expression (1-352 folds) (PÂ <.001). The results of this study suggest that MBL plays a main role in the innate immunity and it is also affected by environmental factors and other genetic variations. Therefore, the MBL gene expression profile does not reflect precise phenotypic levels in the serum.

287732361,2019-12-01T00:00:00,"Accurate detection of pathological conditions in human subjects can be achieved through off-line analysis of recorded biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, human diagnosis is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for diagnosing professionals. In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural processing system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis of pathological conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible pathological conditions, or to trigger an off-line data recording system for further analysis by a medical professional. We apply the system to real-time classification of ECG data for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and pathological rhythms. Multi-channel analog ECG traces are encoded as asynchronous streams of binary events and processed using a spiking recurrent neural network operated in a reservoir computing paradigm. An event-driven neuron output layer is then trained to recognize one of several pathologies. Finally, the filtered activity of this output layer is used to generate a binary trigger signal indicating the presence or absence of a pathological pattern.

However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2). Video detection of cells at 105, 104, 103, and 100 cells/mL is demonstrated in real time using un-reconstructed holograms.

The proposed approach explores the integration of a Raspberry PI single-board PC both as an audio acquisition and analysis unit. A set of real-time feature extraction and classification procedures has been implemented and integrated on the Raspberry PI device, in order to provide continuous and online audio event recognition. In addition, a tuning and calibration workflow is presented, according to which the technicians installing the device in a fast ans user-friendly manner, without any requirements for machine learning expertise. The proposed approach has been evaluated against a particular scenario that is rather important in the context of any healthcare monitoring system for the elder, namely the ""bathroom scenario"" according to which a single microphone installed on a Raspberry PI device is used to monitor bathroom activity in a 24/7 basis. Experimental results indicate a satisfactory performance rate on the classification process (around 70% for five bathroom-related audio classes) even when less than two minutes of annotated data are used for training in the installation procedure.

162582664,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThis paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,,,HAL CCSD,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations. The latter can be used as maintenance directions by a human operator in charge of production monitoring and control","WHODID: Web-based interface for Human-assisted factory Operations in fault Detection, Identification and Diagnosis",10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_47,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
287429785,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of wireless sensor networks, which are the key ingredient in the growing Internet of Things (IoT), has surged over the past few years with a widening range of applications in the industry, healthcare, agriculture, with a special attention to monitoring and tracking, often tied with security issues. In some applications, sensors can be deployed in remote, large unpopulated areas, whereas in others, they serve to monitor confined busy spaces. In either case, clustering the sensor network’s nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network’s lifetime. In the present paper, we survey and compare popular and advanced clustering schemes and provide a detailed analysis of their performance as a function of scale, type of collected data or their heterogeneity, and noise level.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,HAL CCSD,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

352137868,2017-03-31T00:00:00,"Foodborne illness afflicts 48 million people annually in the U.S. alone. Over 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from the infection. While preventable with proper food safety practices, the traditional restaurant inspection process has limited impact given the predictability and low frequency of inspections, and the dynamic nature of the kitchen environment. Despite this reality, the inspection process has remained largely unchanged for decades. CDC has even identified food safety as one of seven ”winnable battles”; however, progress to date has been limited. In this work, we demonstrate significant improvements in food safety by marrying AI and the standard inspection process. We apply machine learning to Twitter data, develop a system that automatically detects venues likely to pose a public health hazard, and demonstrate its efficacy in the Las Vegas metropolitan area in a double-blind experiment conducted over three months in collaboration with Nevada’s health department. By contrast, previous research in this domain has been limited to indirect correlative validation using only aggregate statistics. We show that adaptive inspection process is 64 percent more effective at identifying problematic venues than the current state of the art. If fully deployed, our approach could prevent over 9,000 cases of foodborne illness and 557 hospitalizations annually in Las Vegas alone. Additionally, adaptive inspections result in unexpected benefits, including the identification of venues lacking permits, contagious kitchen staff, and fewer customer complaints filed with the Las Vegas health department",Deploying nEmesis: Preventing Foodborne Illness by Data Mining Social Media,10.1609/aimag.v38i1.2711,,'Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The modules are developed with different algorithm and tested individually to ensure the stability of the system. Artificial Intelligence technique was applied at the face recognition stage while a two degree of freedom mechanism for actuator control was used at face tracking stage. A sequential mode operation is proposed to reduce the execution time in a real-time environment. To achieve this, only one module is operated at each time. A Graphical User Interface was developed to ease the users at the local and robot environment. The system is designed in LabVIEW platform. The biometric system proposed with hybrid algorithm at each module adapts for face images detected at different distances, poses and lighting condition. This system was tested in real-time and has an execution time of 55ms and 98% accuracy. The stand alone system designed for Medical Telediagnosis Robot can be will be very fruitful for various biometric system using facial technology",Towards real-time visual biometric authentication using human face for healthcare telepresence mobile robots,,https://core.ac.uk/download/151089656.pdf,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
202153885,2017-02-28,"AbstractA large part of the biomedical research spectrum is dedicated to develop electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing techniques to contribute to early diagnosis. However, it is common to find that ECG analysis methods reported are confined to off-line PC host operation. The authors present an arrhythmia classification method implemented on a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) platform intended for on-line, real-time ambulatory operation to classify eight heartbeat conditions: normal sinus rhythm (N), auricular fibrillation (AF), premature atrial contraction (PAC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinoauricular heart block (SHB) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The algorithm uses a wavelet transform process based on quadratic wavelets for identifying individual ECG waves and obtain a fiducial marker array. Classification is conducted by means of a Probabilistic Neural Network. The algorithm is tested with 17 ECG records obtained from the PhysioNet repository. The proposed classification procedure was tested initially on MATLAB and the results where compared with the equivalent analogue data fed to a DSP-based ECG data acquisition prototype through an arbitrary waveform generator. The results derived from confusion matrix tests yielded on-line classification accuracy of 92.69% (AF), 97.15% (N), 76.82% (PAC), 91.06% (LBBB), 87.5% (RBBB), 71.04% (PVC), 91.94% (SHB) and 95.45% (SVT), overall classification rate of 92.746% and 100% agreement between the MATLAB and on-line DSP implementations. The results suggest that the method and prototype presented may be suitable for being implemented on wearable sensing applications auxiliary for on-line, real-time diagnosis",DSP-based arrhythmia classification using wavelet transform and probabilistic neural network ,10.1016/j.bspc.2016.10.005,,The Authors.

300365238,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.publishe",VIS4ML : An Ontology for Visual Analytics Assisted Machine Learning,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864838,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
323528435,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Стаття висвітлює проблеми розробки універсальних та адаптивних систем аналізу даних. На прикладі побудови біомедичних систем моніторингу стану здоров’я людини виділені основні принципи, притаманні системам, які аналізують мультимодальні дані. До основних невирішених проблем створення адаптивних систем можна віднести необхідність переконфігурації системи в залежності від вхідної задачі. Для розв’язання задач переконфігурації була запропонована архітектура адаптивної системи аналізу даних. Особливістю запропонованої системи є дворівнева архітектура: незалежна референсна система та підсистема, яка відповідає за адаптивну роботу.The development of adaptive system has been researched for a decade, but only recently machine learning problems became solvable. In this paper is presented an overview of current smart systems and the problem of development real adaptive and versatile data analysis system. Such system has to analyze multivariate signals of different nature. That is why the overview part is based on examples of biomedical human health monitoring systems (BHMS). BHMS have complex internal structure, to simplify it can be divided into three big tiers: tier of data acquisition, communication and analytics tiers. In the first tier, all data acquisition steps are made, including placement sensors to the specific location. The communication tier is responsible for gathering data from all available hardware and send it via wireless channel to the third layer. The analytical tier is the final destination of acquired data. This layer includes all algorithms which will be used for processing data and interpretation of the results. Such simple division allow us to specify and select our potential field of study and improvements. Specifically, in this paper the analytics tier will be explored and new system architecture will be proposed.
The crucial step in the adaptive systems development is solving reconfiguration problem. Nowadays, almost all data analysis systems have specific applicable fields. The main advantages of the latter are that they are robust, fast, but the development of such system can take a lot of time and reconfiguration of currently used systems will allow speed up that process. The reconfiguration is process of creation a specific targeting system from general system setup or currently known system. In this paper we have investigated problems, related with reconfiguration and proposing the theoretical basis for creation the reconfigurable adaptive system. The output structure is two-tier system, which allow to analyze any task from different field of study and then process it in a single setup. Each of the tier is considered as independent components, however the combination of the general reference system (tier one) and training agent subsystem (tier two) creates a highly adaptive system with reconfiguration properties. The reference system itself is a big storage of available algorithms which can be applied for certain problem and the algorithms workflow can be tuned for specific problem. Such adjustments can be made because of system training agent, which main purpose is to process input task and defined which algorithms can be applied. Such task classification problem can be solved by using machine learning algorithms.
Since, this paper presents only theoretical basis there is no precise implementation of proposed system. Currently we just gave a small overview of the future development of adaptive and reconfigurable systems.В данной работе были исследованы проблемы разработки универсальных и адаптивных систем анализа данных.

163105483,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,https://core.ac.uk/download/163105483.pdf,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells. Hence, the IncuCyte system and its NeuroTrack module provide an appealing platform for efficient in vitro studies of antifungal compounds and immunotherapeu-tic strategies in medical mycology.openWurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P.Wurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P","Live monitoring and analysis of fungal growth, viability, and mycelial morphology using the incucyte neurotrack processing module",10.1128/mBio.00673-19,https://core.ac.uk/download/233571269.pdf,'American Society for Microbiology',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

industrial automation, virtual reality, e-health, and several intelligent applications, machine learning (ML)

is expected to be essential to assist in making the 5G vision conceivable. This paper focuses on the potential

solutions for 5G from an ML-perspective. First, we establish the fundamental concepts of supervised,

unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, taking a look at what has been done so far in the adoption of

ML in the context of mobile and wireless communication, organizing the literature in terms of the types of

learning.We then discuss the promising approaches for how ML can contribute to supporting each target 5G

network requirement, emphasizing its specific use cases and evaluating the impact and limitations they have

on the operation of the network. Lastly, this paper investigates the potential features of Beyond 5G (B5G),

providing future research directions for how ML can contribute to realizing B5G. This article is intended

A knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making and coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves performing complex tasks in the “physical” real world to achieve a common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable, and knowledge-intensive processes must be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue. To tackle this issue, in this paper we present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process Management System featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated adaptation of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able to automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions occur, without explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions and without the intervention of domain experts at runtime, aiming at reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc changes, and thus at relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish this, we make use of well-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. The approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been implemented and validated with a case study based on real knowledge-intensive processes coming from an emergency management domain",Intelligent Process Adaptation in the SmartPM System,10.1145/2948071,,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The immunodevice is based on chemisorption of open tissue transglutaminase enzyme on the surface of gold nanoparticles-functionalized carbon screen printed electrodes. IgA and IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase target antibodies are recognized by the immobilized bioreceptor as highly specific biomarkers related to Celiac Disease. The signal from the amperometric sensor is acquired and processed through on-purpose developed IoT-WiFi integrated board, allowing for real-time data sharing on cloud services to directly notify all users (physicians, caregivers, etc.) on device outcome. The proposed solution does not require customized hardware or software. The analytical performances of the immunosensors were optimized by experimental design, obtaining diagnostically useful limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) values (LODIgA=3.2 AU mL−1; LODIgG=1.4 AU mL−1; LOQIgA=4.6 AU mL−1; LOQIgG =2.3 AU mL−1) as well as good intermediate precision (RSD &lt; 5%).

Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient state prediction among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of forecasting glucose levels with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38±0.71 [mg/dL] over a 30-minute horizon, RMSE = 18.87±2.25 [mg/dL] over a 60-minute horizon) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.07±2.35 [mg/dL] for 30-minute, RMSE = 33.27±4.79\% for 60-minute). In addition, the model provides competitive performance in providing effective prediction horizon ( PHeff) with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset ( PHeff = 29.0±0.7 for 30-min and PHeff = 49.8±2.9 for 60-min) and in a real patient dataset ( PHeff = 19.3±3.1 for 30-min and PHeff = 29.3±9.4 for 60-min).

The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows  to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases.

This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors.

275782095,2019,"International audienceBACKGROUND: Mortality surveillance is of fundamental importance to public health surveillance. The real-time recording of death certificates, thanks to Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS), provides valuable data for reactive mortality surveillance based on medical causes of death in free-text format. Reactive mortality surveillance is based on the monitoring of mortality syndromic groups (MSGs). An MSG is a cluster of medical causes of death (pathologies, syndromes or symptoms) that meets the objectives of early detection and impact assessment of public health events. The aim of this study is to implement and measure the performance of a rule-based method and two supervised models for automatic free-text cause of death classification from death certificates in order to implement them for routine surveillance.METHOD: A rule-based method was implemented using four processing steps: standardization rules, splitting causes of death using delimiters, spelling corrections and dictionary projection. A supervised machine learning method using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was also implemented. Two models were produced using different features (SVM1 based solely on surface features and SVM2 combining surface features and MSGs classified by the rule-based method as feature vectors). The evaluation was conducted using an annotated subset of electronic death certificates received between 2012 and 2016. Classification performance was evaluated on seven MSGs (Influenza, Low respiratory diseases, Asphyxia/abnormal respiration, Acute respiratory disease, Sepsis, Chronic digestive diseases, and Chronic endocrine diseases).RESULTS: The rule-based method and the SVM2 model displayed a high performance with F-measures over 0.94 for all MSGs. Precision and recall were slightly higher for the rule-based method and the SVM2 model. An error-analysis shows that errors were not specific to an MSG.CONCLUSION: The high performance of the rule-based method and SVM2 model will allow us to set-up a reactive mortality surveillance system based on free-text death certificates. This surveillance will be an added-value for public health decision making",Automatic classification of free-text medical causes from death certificates for reactive mortality surveillance in France,,,Elsevier,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2).

189855542,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322372256,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.Scopu",A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier,10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
481645603,2019-07-01T00:00:00,"Commercially available health monitors rely on rigid electronic housing coupled with aggressive adhesives and conductive gels, causing discomfort and inducing skin damage. Also, research-level skin-wearable devices, while excelling in some aspects, fall short as concept-only presentations due to the fundamental challenges of active wireless communication and integration as a single device platform. Here, an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable hybrid electronics with key capabilities for real-time physiological monitoring, automatic detection of signal abnormality via deep-learning, and a long-range wireless connectivity (up to 15 m) is introduced. The strategic integration of thin-film electronic layers with hyperelastic elastomers allows the overall device to adhere and deform naturally with the human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. The stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact are capable of generating clinical-grade electrocardiograms and accurate analysis of heart and respiratory rates while the motion sensor assesses physical activities. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time physiological classifications demonstrates the feasibility of multifaceted analysis with a high clinical relevance. Finally, in vivo demonstrations with animals and human subjects in various scenarios reveal the versatility of the device as both a health monitor and a viable research tool.ope","All-in-One, Wireless, Stretchable Hybrid Electronics for Smart, Connected, and Ambulatory Physiological Monitoring",10.1002/advs.201900939,https://core.ac.uk/download/481645603.pdf,'Wiley',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322656794,2019-10-20T00:00:00,"[EN] Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

Recently, the number of inventions based on AI has sharply increased. The leaders in the number of such inventions are American compa­nies IBM and Microsoft. This growth is due to the fact that in recent years AI has evolved from the theoretical concept into a real product that gains the world market. Since the advent of AI in the 50’s of the last century, inventors and researchers have applied for almost 340 thousand inventions based on AI (as of the end of 2016) and published more than 1.6 million scientific articles. The transport sector, including au­tonomous vehicles, is one of the sectors with the highest rates of growth in the appli­cation of AI. China has become a global leader in increasing the number of patents in the AI sphere over the past five years.By the number of companies working in the sphere of AI, Ukraine is among the three leaders among the countries of Eastern Europe.

251203367,2018-10-11T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND: Logistic regression is a popular technique used in machine learning to construct classification models. Since the construction of such models is based on computing with large datasets, it is an appealing idea to outsource this computation to a cloud service. The privacy-sensitive nature of the input data requires appropriate privacy preserving measures before outsourcing it. Homomorphic encryption enables one to compute on encrypted data directly, without decryption and can be used to mitigate the privacy concerns raised by using a cloud service. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an algorithm (and its implementation) to train a logistic regression model on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. The core of our algorithm consists of a new iterative method that can be seen as a simplified form of the fixed Hessian method, but with a much lower multiplicative complexity. RESULTS: We test the new method on two interesting real life applications: the first application is in medicine and constructs a model to predict the probability for a patient to have cancer, given genomic data as input; the second application is in finance and the model predicts the probability of a credit card transaction to be fraudulent. The method produces accurate results for both applications, comparable to running standard algorithms on plaintext data. CONCLUSIONS: This article introduces a new simple iterative algorithm to train a logistic regression model that is tailored to be applied on a homomorphically encrypted dataset. This algorithm can be used as a privacy-preserving technique to build a binary classification model and can be applied in a wide range of problems that can be modelled with logistic regression. Our implementation results show that our method can handle the large datasets used in logistic regression training.status: publishe",Privacy-preserving logistic regression training,10.1186/s12920-018-0398-y,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"[{'title': 'BMC Medical Genomics', 'identifiers': ['1755-8794', 'issn:1755-8794']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478671759,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration",Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
226925383,2019-10-01T00:00:00,"International audiencePurpose - Annotation of surgical activities becomes increasingly important for many recent applications such as surgical workflow analysis, surgical situation awareness, and the design of the operating room of the future, especially to train machine learning methods in order to develop intelligent assistance. Currently, annotation is mostly performed by observers with medical background and is incredibly costly and time-consuming, creating a major bottleneck for the above-mentioned technologies. In this paper, we propose a way to eliminate, or at least limit, the human intervention in the annotation process.  Methods - Meaningful information about interaction between objects is inherently available in virtual reality environments. We propose a strategy to convert automatically this information into annotations in order to provide as output individual surgical process models.  Validation - We implemented our approach through a peg-transfer task simulator and compared it to manual annotations. To assess the impact of our contribution, we studied both intra- and inter-observer variability.  Results and conclusion - In average, manual annotations took more than 12 min for 1 min of video to achieve low-level physical activity annotation, whereas automatic annotation is achieved in less than a second for the same video period. We also demonstrated that manual annotation introduced mistakes as well as intra- and inter-observer variability that our method is able to suppress due to the high precision and reproducibility",Automatic annotation of surgical activities using virtual reality environments,10.1007/s11548-019-02008-x,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
302679903,2018-08-17T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly",VIS4ML: an ontology for visual analytics assisted machine learning,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864838,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics', 'identifiers': ['1077-2626', 'issn:1077-2626']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, it is common to find that ECG analysis methods reported are confined to off-line PC host operation. The authors present an arrhythmia classification method implemented on a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) platform intended for on-line, real-time ambulatory operation to classify eight heartbeat conditions: normal sinus rhythm (N), auricular fibrillation (AF), premature atrial contraction (PAC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinoauricular heart block (SHB) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The algorithm uses a wavelet transform process based on quadratic wavelets for identifying individual ECG waves and obtain a fiducial marker array. Classification is conducted by means of a Probabilistic Neural Network. The algorithm is tested with 17 ECG records obtained from the PhysioNet repository. The proposed classification procedure was tested initially on MATLAB and the results where compared with the equivalent analogue data fed to a DSP-based ECG data acquisition prototype through an arbitrary waveform generator. The results derived from confusion matrix tests yielded on-line classification accuracy of 92.69% (AF), 97.15% (N), 76.82% (PAC), 91.06% (LBBB), 87.5% (RBBB), 71.04% (PVC), 91.94% (SHB) and 95.45% (SVT), overall classification rate of 92.746% and 100% agreement between the MATLAB and on-line DSP implementations.

Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a cardiac biomarker exploited extensively for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We report a highly sensitive microfluidic biosensor for electrochemical detection of human cTnI in real patient samples. In this device, a patterned mesoporous nickel vanadate hollow-nanospheres modified chitosan (Ch-Ni3V2O8) was integrated with microfluidic structure. With excellent redox activity and biocompatibility, larger surface, tunable oxidation states (V5+, V4+, and V3+), the Ch-Ni3V2O8 matrix was used to functionalize the cardiac antibodies of troponin I (cAb) and amplify the electrochemical readouts. This device offered a high sensitivity of 38.88 µA/ng mL-1/cm2 for a wide range of cTnI concentration (0.005‒100 ng mL‒1). A low limit-of-detection of 5 pg mL‒1 and high stability, high reproducibility and good selectivity were achieved due to integration of microfluidic elements with hollow-nanosphere Ch-Ni3V2O8.

This paper discusses how an ""open science"" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing.

So far, several techniques have been implemented to track and identify SMMs. In this context, we propose a deep learning approach for SMM recognition, namely, convolutional neural networks (CNN) in time and frequency-domains. To solve the intrasubject SMM variability, we propose a robust CNN model for SMM detection within subjects, whose parameters are set according to a proper analysis of SMM signals, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art SMM classification works. And, to solve the intersubject variability, we propose a global, fast, and light-weight framework for SMM detection across subjects which combines a knowledge transfer technique with an SVM classifier, therefore resolving the “real-life” medical issue associated with the lack of supervised SMMs per testing subject in particular. We further show that applying transfer learning across domains instead of transfer learning within the same domain also generalizes to the SMM target domain, thus alleviating the problem of the lack of supervised SMMs in general",A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Recognizing Stereotypical Motor Movements within and across Subjects on the Autism Spectrum Disorder,10.1155/2018/7186762,,'Hindawi Limited',"[{'title': 'Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience', 'identifiers': ['issn:1687-5273', '1687-5273', '1687-5265', 'issn:1687-5265']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The four algorithms are based on stride time, foot acceleration, foot trajectory estimation, and deep learning, respectively.

Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-104 cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2).

322840422,2019-11-01T00:00:00,"International audienceWireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a quite suitable communication tool for medical IoT devices that are deployed to collect physiological parameters and forecast real-time events in order to facilitate the diagnostic decision-making for the medical staff. However, sensor readings may be inaccurate due to resource-constrained devices, sensor misplacement, hardware faults, and other environmental factors. Therefore, anomaly detection is envisioned as a promising approach to deal with unreliable and malicious data injection to improve remote patient monitoring systems and reduce false medical diagnosis. In this context, several data analysis and machine learning tools have been proposed to detect abnormal deviations in WBAN. Nevertheless, no one considers the dynamic context changes of WBAN to provide adaptive and dynamic outlier detection. In addition, most of them ignore the co-existence of strong spatial and temporal correlations between monitored physiological attributes. To this end, we propose a two-level lightweight and adaptive anomaly detection approach to discard false alarms caused by faulty measurements and raise alarms only when a patient seems to be in emergency situations. In the first level, a game-theoretic technique is introduced wherein body-worn sensor nodes exploit the spatiotemporal correlation among readings to locally and adaptively detect anomalous events according to the dynamic context changes of WBAN. In the second level, we apply the Mahalanobis distance in the Local Processing Unit (LPU) which has a global view for multivariate analysis. Our main objective is to ensure a tradeoff between detection accuracy, false positive rates, and network performance while considering the WBAN environment constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated through numerical simulations on a real physiological data set.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to perform medical image classification and assist clinicians in diagnosing radiological scans. In this paper, we apply 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) to classify computed tomography (CT) brain scans into normal scans (N) and abnormal scans containing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), acute subdural hemorrhage (ASDH) and brain polytrauma hemorrhage (BPH). The dataset used consists of 399 volumetric CT brain images representing approximately 12,000 images from the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. We used a 3D CNN to perform both 2-class (normal versus a specific abnormal class) and 4-class classification (between normal, SAH, IPH, ASDH).

The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms.

Recently, several attempts were conducted to transfer deep learning to medical image reconstruction. An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a result, many approaches use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable problems.





Methods

PYRO‐NN is a generalized framework to embed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow. The current status includes state‐of‐the‐art parallel‐, fan‐, and cone‐beam projectors, and back‐projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow layers. On top, the framework provides a high‐level Python API to conduct FBP and iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems.





Results

The framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to design end‐to‐end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction algorithms. The high‐level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as known from Tensorflow. All algorithms and tools are referenced to a scientific publication and are compared to existing non‐deep learning reconstruction frameworks. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, the framework comes with baseline experiments, which are described in the supplementary material. The framework is available as open‐source software under the Apache 2.0 licence at https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN.





Conclusions

PYRO‐NN comes with the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end‐to‐end trainable neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We believe that the framework will be a step toward reproducible research and give the medical physics community a toolkit to elevate medical image reconstruction with new deep learning techniques",Technical Note: PYRO‐NN: Python reconstruction operators in neural networks,10.1002/mp.13753,,'Wiley',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations.

The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range.

426867658,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"Acoustic pollution has been associated with adverse effects on the health and life expectancy of people, especially when noise exposure happens during the nighttime. With over half of the world population living in urban areas, acoustic pollution is an important concern for city administrators, especially those focused on transportation and leisure noise. Advances in sensor and network technologies made the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) possible in cities, which, combined with artificial intelligence (AI), can enable smart services for their citizens. However, the creation of such services often requires structured environmental audio databases to train AI algorithms. This paper reports on an environmental audio dataset of 363 min and 53 s created in a lively area of the Barcelona city center, which targeted traffic and leisure events. This dataset, which is free and publicly available, can provide researchers with real-world acoustic data to help the development and testing of sound monitoring solutions for urban environments",BCNDataset: Description and Analysis of an Annotated Night Urban Leisure Sound Dataset,,,'MDPI AG',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
440978332,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND:High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota. METHODS:Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results. RESULTS:AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3-11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa. CONCLUSION:Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa. For fungal analysis, ITS2 allowed the detection of a greater number of minor taxa compared with ITS1",Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?,10.1371/journal.pone.0232215,,'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',"[{'title': 'PLoS ONE', 'identifiers': ['issn:1932-6203', '1932-6203']}]",core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
346545484,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly",VIS4ML: an ontology for visual analytics assisted machine learning,,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
299984454,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Big data, coupled with the use of advanced analytical approaches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have the potential to improve medical outcomes and population health. Data that are routinely generated from, for example, electronic medical records and smart devices have become progressively easier and cheaper to collect, process, and analyze. In recent decades, this has prompted a substantial increase in biomedical research efforts outside traditional clinical trial settings. Despite the apparent enthusiasm of researchers, funders, and the media, evidence is scarce for successful implementation of products, algorithms, and services arising that make a real difference to clinical care. This article collection provides concrete examples of how “big data” can be used to advance healthcare and discusses some of the limitations and challenges encountered with this type of research. It primarily focuses on real-world data, such as electronic medical records and genomic medicine, considers new developments in AI and digital health, and discusses ethical considerations and issues related to data sharing. Overall, we remain positive that big data studies and associated new technologies will continue to guide novel, exciting research that will ultimately improve healthcare and medicine—but we are also realistic that concerns remain about privacy, equity, security, and benefit to all.Published versio",Beyond the hype of big data and artificial intelligence : building foundations for knowledge and wisdom,10.1186/s12916-019-1382-x,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The relative mRNA expression of the MBL gene was quantified using real-time PCR. Data analysis was carried out by spss software. The MBL concentration was significantly higher in the participants suffering from RVVC compared to the control group (0.330Â ng/mL vs 0.253Â ng/mL). The prognostic value (PÂ <.001) for RVVC diagnosis has been calculated. Quantitative RT-PCR results from 35 samples showed a low to significant values for mRNA levels corresponding to MBL gene expression (1-352 folds) (PÂ <.001). The results of this study suggest that MBL plays a main role in the innate immunity and it is also affected by environmental factors and other genetic variations. Therefore, the MBL gene expression profile does not reflect precise phenotypic levels in the serum.

300465489,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a supervised classification method to accurately detect epileptic brain activity in real-time from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straightforward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature",Fast statistical model-based classification of epileptic EEG signals,10.1016/j.bbe.2018.08.002,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
287732361,2019-12-01T00:00:00,"Accurate detection of pathological conditions in human subjects can be achieved through off-line analysis of recorded biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, human diagnosis is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for diagnosing professionals. In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural processing system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis of pathological conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible pathological conditions, or to trigger an off-line data recording system for further analysis by a medical professional. We apply the system to real-time classification of ECG data for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and pathological rhythms. Multi-channel analog ECG traces are encoded as asynchronous streams of binary events and processed using a spiking recurrent neural network operated in a reservoir computing paradigm. An event-driven neuron output layer is then trained to recognize one of several pathologies. Finally, the filtered activity of this output layer is used to generate a binary trigger signal indicating the presence or absence of a pathological pattern. We validate the approach proposed using a Dynamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor (DYNAP) chip, implemented using a standard 180 nm CMOS VLSI process, and present experimental results measured from the chi",Real-Time Ultra-Low Power ECG Anomaly Detection Using an Event-Driven Neuromorphic Processor,10.1109/tbcas.2019.2953001,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/184174/9/1911.05521.pdf,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human–computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one ﬁnds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The ﬁrst branch explores geo-metric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the ﬁnal classiﬁca-tion score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on ﬁve benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The data-bases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

440979163,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Wrong-site surgeries can occur due to the absence of an appropriate surgical time-out. However, during a time-out, surgical participants are unable to review the patient's charts due to their aseptic hands. To improve the conditions in surgical time-outs, we introduce a deep learning-based smart speaker to confirm the surgical information prior to cataract surgeries. This pilot study utilized the publicly available audio vocabulary dataset and recorded audio data published by the authors. The audio clips of the target words, such as left, right, cataract, phacoemulsification, and intraocular lens, were selected to determine and confirm surgical information in the time-out speech. A deep convolutional neural network model was trained and implemented in the smart speaker that was developed using a mini development board and commercial speakerphone. To validate our model in the consecutive speeches during time-outs, we generated 200 time-out speeches for cataract surgeries by randomly selecting the surgical statuses of the surgical participants. After the training process, the deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.3% for the validation dataset of short-word audio clips. Our deep learning-based smart speaker achieved an accuracy of 93.5% for the 200 time-out speeches. The surgical and procedural accuracy was 100%. Additionally, on validating the deep learning model by using web-generated time-out speeches and video clips for general surgery, the model exhibited a robust and good performance. In this pilot study, the proposed deep learning-based smart speaker was able to successfully confirm the surgical information during the time-out speech.

395142972,2019-08-11T00:00:00,"[EN] Modelling the dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles, such as buses or trucks, can be very useful for driving simulation and training, autonomous driving, crash analysis, etc. However, dynamic modelling of a vehicle is a difficult task because there are many subsystems and signals that affect its behaviour. In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

Compared to marine species from all kingdoms, freshwater species have been highly neglected. Objective: This work focuses on the screening of acetylcholinesterase inhibitory (AChE) and mutagenic activities of the acetone extract (obtained by maceration) of the freshwater sponge Ochridaspongia rotunda Arndt (Malawispongiidae) in vitro. Materials and methods: AChE inhibitory activity was evaluated both in liquid (five different concentrations of the extract, from 1 to 100 mu g/mL) and in solid (seven different concentrations of the extract, from 0.5 to 10.0 mu g) by methods well described in literature, while mutagenicity was estimated using the Ames test (four different concentrations of the extract, from 0.106 to 1.328mg/plate). Results: Ochridaspongia rotunda acetone extract exhibited promising AChE inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner both in liquid (IC50 23.07 mu g/mL) and in solid (1.50 mu g). Furthermore, the Ames test revealed no sign of mutagenicity at any concentration tested. Its FTIR spectrum coupled with the positive Liebermann-Burchard, Salkowski and Zak color reactions (tests) indicated the presence of sterol compounds. Discussion and conclusion: The screened extract may inspire a search for novel anticholinesterase therapeutic agent(s) potentially used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration.publishedVersio",Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,https://core.ac.uk/download/288328958.pdf,,,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis).

370074721,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

196141017,2018,"According to statistics, every fifth married couple is faced with the inability to conceive a child. Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample. At the final stage of study, the program's functioningwas tested on real data.За статистикою, кожна п'ята подружня пара стикається з неможливістю зачаття дитини. Чоловічі статеві клітини дуже вразливі, зростаюче число випадків чоловічого безпліддя підтверджує, що в сучасному світі дуже багато чинників, які впливають і на активність сперматозоїдів і на їх кількість. Та важливою є не стільки їх кількість, скільки якість. Спермограма є об'єктивним методом лабораторної діагностики, що дозволяє максимально точно оцінити здатність до запліднення чоловіка, проаналізувавши еякулят за рядом найважливіших параметрів. Тільки спермограма здатна відповісти на питання про можливе чоловіче безпліддя та про наявність урологічних захворювань. При побудові спермограми, важливо визначати не тільки кількість добрих сперматозоїдів, але й їх морфологію та рухливість. Тому дослідження та вдосконалення деяких етапів спермограми і є метою дослідження. У даній статті вирішується задача класифікації сперматозоїдів на добрі та погані, з урахуванням їх рухливості та морфології, із застосуванням методів машинного навчання. Для реалізації першого етапу машинного навчання (з вчителем) у графічному редакторі були створені навчальні екземпляри (тренувальна вибірка). Навчання було реалізована трьома методами: методом опорних векторів, логістична регресія та метод К - найближчих сусідів. За результатами тестування обрано метод К - найближчих сусідів. На етапі тестування використовувалася вибірка з 15 різних сперматозоїдів в різних варіаціях обертання навколо своєї осі. Тестова вибірка не містила примірників з тренувальної вибірки і була сформована з урахуванням морфологічних особливостей сперматозоїдів, але не копіювала їх з тренувальної вибірки.

200793946,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Augmented reality (AR) is a new technology. Very few people know about its development, which began in 1970s from massive and primitive devices. Now AR is at the very peak of its improvement in the form of various software. Augmented reality has its application in the following devices: glasses, phones, tablets. Augmented reality works on the basis of two stages: object recognition and marker tracking. Recognition occurs on the basis of machine learning and tracking of markers by finding certain elements or special markers. The analogue of this principle of operation is SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building). But the best results are achieved with the simultaneous use of two technologies. AR is involved in different areas: education, medicine, entertainment, military training. For education, three-dimensional 3D models are used, which are more visual for students and simplify their studies. In entertainment, AR has found a place for itself in various social networks in the form of masks (Snapchat), games (Pokemon GO) and others. In medicine, in addition to training, AR is used to visualize the internal organs of patients. Augmented reality has great potential for development in practical application in everyday life environments because it does not require high hardware characteristics.Дополненная реальность, или AR (augmented reality) – новая технология, развитие которой сейчас мало кому известно. Она начала развитие в 70-х годах прошлого века от массивных и примитивных устройств. Сейчас же находится на самом пике своего совершенствования в виде различных ПО. Дополненная реальность имеет свое применение в следующий устройствах: очки, телефоны, планшеты. AR работает на основе двух этапов: распознавание объектов и отслеживание маркеров. Распознавание происходит на базе машинного обучения, а отслеживание маркеров путем нахождения определенных элементов или специальных маркеров. Аналогом данного принципа работы является технология SLAM. Но наилучшие результаты достигаются при одновременном использовании двух технологий. AR заполняет все больше сфер. Для образования используют объемные 3D модели, которые являются более наглядными для студентов и упрощают их обучение. В развлечениях AR нашло себе место в различных социальных сетях в виде масок (Snapchat), игр (Pokemon GO) и других. В медицине, помимо обучения, AR используют для визуализации внутренних органов пациентов.

Due to the physical properties of the materials, the change in the performance of the R2R processing equipment can easily cause deformation of the flexible film material, it is particularly important to predict the performance degradation of the processing equipment. Based on the accuracy and real-time requirements of performance degradation prediction, a PTS-FNN model for performance degradation prediction was proposed in this paper, which combines the Possibilistic C-Means (PCM) fuzzy clustering and Takagi–Sugeno Fuzzy Neural Network (TS-FNN). We also studied the PCM classification algorithm of input data of PTS-FNN model, the predecessor network of TS-FNN prediction model and the construction method of post-component network. Finally, the implementation process of PCM classification algorithm and TS-FNN prediction model were given. The R2R processing equipment health prediction experiment system was built and the PTS-FNN model experiment was carried out. The experimental results showed that the training time of PTS-FNN model was 50.37% less than the standard TS-FNN prediction model.

387851240,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

477989381,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls is one of most concerning accidents in aged population due to its high frequency and serious repercussion; thus, quick assistance is critical to avoid serious health consequences. There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement.This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program as part of the ACTIVAGE project under Grant 732679.Sarabia-Jácome, D.; Usach, R.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

However, their routine use must be balanced against costs and practical considerations.Weak recommendation, high quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends the routine use of high definition systems in individuals with Lynch syndrome.Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends the routine use, with targeted biopsies, of dye-based pancolonic chromoendoscopy or virtual chromoendoscopy for neoplasia surveillance in patients with long-standing colitis.Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE suggests that virtual chromoendoscopy and dye-based chromoendoscopy can be used, under strictly controlled conditions, for real-time optical diagnosis of diminutive (</= 5 mm) colorectal polyps and can replace histopathological diagnosis. The optical diagnosis has to be reported using validated scales, must be adequately photodocumented, and can be performed only by experienced endoscopists who are adequately trained, as defined in the ESGE curriculum, and audited.Weak recommendation, high quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the use of high definition white-light endoscopy in combination with (virtual) chromoendoscopy to predict the presence and depth of any submucosal invasion in nonpedunculated colorectal polyps prior to any treatment. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends the use of virtual or dye-based chromoendoscopy in addition to white-light endoscopy for the detection of residual neoplasia at a piecemeal polypectomy scar site. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 7: ESGE suggests the possible incorporation of computer-aided diagnosis (detection and characterization of lesions) to colonoscopy, if acceptable and reproducible accuracy for colorectal neoplasia is demonstrated in high quality multicenter in vivo clinical studies. Possible significant risks with implementation, specifically endoscopist deskilling and over-reliance on artificial intelligence, unrepresentative training datasets, and hacking, need to be considered.

The aim of the current review was to summarize current applications of 18F-FDOPA PET in gliomas and constitute, as a perspective, a first step in harmonizing clinical practices in French centers. In France, the indication for 18F-FDOPA PET is restricted to the assessment of primary brain tumor recurrence. According to the literature, this indication could be expanded to primary diagnosis and, to a lesser extent, treatment monitoring. There is a real need to harmonize standard procedures among French centers. The objective is to increase the availability of data for this rare entity of glioma and to develop multi-parametric PET analyses (static, dynamic and textural), also known as radiomics, by using artificial intelligence algorithms. For this purpose, kinetics analysis with dynamic PET acquisition should be implemented in routine practice because it has demonstrated its additional value for initial diagnosis in gliomas. Therefore, this review proposes a workflow based on acquisition and reconstruction parameters that can be implemented in each center to increase the amount of standardized 18F-FDOPA PET data in neuro-oncology imaging in France. This would help in creating a national database and developing national multi-center studies that can respond to the challenge of using multi-parametric PET in glioma",La TEP à la 18F-FDOPA dans les gliomes : applications actuelles et perspectives,10.1016/j.mednuc.2020.02.006,,'Elsevier BV',,core,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
