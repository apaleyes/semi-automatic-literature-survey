In order to help spread the potential benefits of autonomy sooner, as well as to cater to people who will continue to prefer to drive themselves while improving safety, there is a need for intelligent interaction and collaboration between increasingly automated vehicles and humans. At Toyota Research Institute, we call this Human-Centric Intelligent Driving (HCID). HCID has many technical challenges, some of which are shared with fully autonomous driving. Due to the collaborative nature between humans and machines in HCID, some of these challenges are particularly important and potentially different from fully autonomous driving. This chapter focuses on Toyota Research Institute’s (TRI) approach to addressing some of these core challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-11112-9_8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In 2013, deep neural networks were vulnerable to perturbed samples during the testing/deployment stage. Deep learning becomes a significant issue when we apply such algorithms in designing safety–critical applications. Deep neural networks are fooled by adding some noise intentionally in the image such that the changes are sometimes not noticeable to the human eye and are known as an adversarial mechanism. The noise adds in such a direction that the difference between the original and perturbed images should be minimal. This work demonstrates the designing of adversarial images and analyzing them on the disease prediction using a chest X-ray prototype system. This work illustrates the design of adversarial samples using three different methods: an image augmentation scheme, filtering, and patches and analysis of how adversarial samples affect the result in real-world clinical settings. The change in the clinical setting not only affects the healthcare economy but also raises technical vulnerability. This work attempts to design and improve a more robust medical learning system. The analysis shows if patches applied in specific regions give expected results to the adversary. In this work, after the successful attack model shows 71% of confidence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0151-5_29,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The growing potential of multimodal data streams and deep learning algorithms has contributed to the increasing universality of deep multimodal learning. This involves the development of models capable of processing and analyzing the multimodal information uniformly. Unstructured real-world data can inherently take many forms, also known as modalities, often including visual and textual content. Extracting relevant patterns from this kind of data is still a motivating goal for researchers in deep learning. In this paper, we seek to improve the understanding of key concepts and algorithms of deep multimodal learning for the computer vision community by exploring how to generate deep models that consider the integration and combination of heterogeneous visual cues across sensory modalities. In particular, we summarize six perspectives from the current literature on deep multimodal learning, namely: multimodal data representation, multimodal fusion (i.e., both traditional and deep learning-based schemes), multitask learning, multimodal alignment, multimodal transfer learning, and zero-shot learning. We also survey current multimodal applications and present a collection of benchmark datasets for solving problems in various vision domains.

However, predicting real time demand at the micro-geographical level is a challenging task due to its underlying complexity, and prior work has focused largely on predicting one-step-ahead demand at a macro-geographical level, often using classical times series models that do not consider exogenous factors or quantify the prediction uncertainty in a probabilistic setting. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based framework with a novel architecture to predict multi-step-ahead real time travel demand, along with uncertainty estimation. The model is multi-stage and captures both spatial and temporal aspects. We employ the encoder-decoder framework with variations of convolution and LSTM units, and incorporate an attention mechanism into the model to quantify the interdependence between the input and output elements.

The repercussion of mischievous attacks on this new technology would be a calamity in both physical meanings and trustworthiness; the rapid escalation in the number of eco-friendly services developments will have a massive blowback, especially while we are on the 5G doorstep.

The cameras of smartphones have small apertures and small sensor cells, which lead to the noisy images in low light environment. Denoising based on a burst of multiple frames generally outperforms single frame denoising but with the larger compututional cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective burst denoising system. We adopt a three-stage design: noise prior integration, multi-frame alignment and multi-frame denoising. First, we integrate noise prior by pre-processing raw signals into a variance-stabilization space, which allows using a small-scale network to achieve competitive performance. Second, we observe that it is essential to adopt an explicit alignment for burst denoising, but it is not necessary to integrate an learning-based method to perform multi-frame alignment. Instead, we resort to a conventional and efficient alignment method and combine it with our multi-frame denoising network. At last, we propose a denoising strategy that processes multiple frames sequentially. Sequential denoising avoids filtering a large number of frames by decomposing multiple frames denoising into several efficient sub-network denoising. As for each sub-network, we propose an efficient multi-frequency denoising network to remove noise of different frequencies. Our three-stage design is efficient and shows strong performance on burst denoising. Experiments on synthetic and real raw datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with less computational cost. Furthermore, the low complexity and high-quality performance make deployment on smartphones possible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-022-01627-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Modelling social interactions is of great significance for pedestrian trajectory prediction. However, most of the existing works only focus on the pair-wise interactions of humans but ignore the group-wise interactions. This paper proposes a group constrained hierarchical graph attention network, GCHGAT, to capture the intragroup, outgroup, and intergroup interaction separately. We first get a rough prediction via a vanilla generative adversarial network. Then, a state-refinement module is used to refine the rough prediction based on interaction information. We compare the performance of our method with related methods on the ETH and UCY datasets.

Unfortunately, the problems of misinformation and disinformation are exacerbated due to the wide availability of online platforms and social networks. Naturally, these emerging disinformation networks could lead users to engage with critical infrastructure systems in harmful ways, leading to broader adverse impacts. One such example involves the spread of false pricing information, which causes drastic and sudden changes in user commodity consumption behavior, leading to shortages. Given this, it is critical to address the following related questions: (i) How can we monitor the evolution of disinformation dissemination and its projected impacts on commodity consumption? (ii) What effects do the mitigation efforts of human intermediaries have on the performance of the infrastructure network subject to disinformation campaigns? (iii) How can we manage infrastructure network operations and counter disinformation in concert to avoid shortages and satisfy user demands? To answer these questions, we develop a hybrid approach that integrates an epidemiological model of disinformation spread (based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, or SIR) with an efficient mixed-integer programming optimization model for infrastructure network performance. The goal of the optimization model is to determine the best protection and response actions against disinformation to minimize the general shortage of commodities at different nodes over time.

Characteristics such as automatic flight control, flight time, and image acquisition have fueled various computer-vision tasks, providing better efficiency and usefulness than fixed viewing surveillance cameras. However, in constrained scenarios, the number of UAV-based aerial datasets is still low, which comparatively focuses on specific tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper, we present a high-resolution UAV-based image-dataset, named “NITRDrone” focusing on aerial image segmentation tasks especially extracting the road networks from the aerial images. The images and video sequences in this dataset are captured over different locations of the NITR campus area, covering around 650 acres. Thus, it provides many diversified scenarios to be considered while analyzing aerial images. In particular, the dataset is prepared to address the existing challenges in UAV-based aerial image segmentation problems. Extensive experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed dataset to address the aerial segmentation problems through the existing state-of-the-art methodologies. Out of the considered baseline methodologies, U-Net performs the best with an intersection of union (IoU) of 0.77, followed DeepLabplusException (IoU: 0.74) and SegNet (IoU: 0.68).

In instances where blinking is consequential, eye state recognition plays a critical part for the development of human–machine interaction (HMI) solutions. To accomplish this objective, pre-trained CNN architectures on ImageNet were first trained on the both dataset, which included both open and closed-eye states, and then they were tested, and their performance was quantified. The AlexNet design has proven to be more successful owing to these assessments. The ZJU and CEW datasets were leveraged to train the DCNN architecture, which was constructed employing AlexNet modifications for performance enhancement. On the both datasets, the suggested DCNN architecture was tested for performance. The achieved DCNN design was found to have 97.32% accuracy, 95.37% sensitivity, 97.97% specificity, 93.99% precision, 94.67% F 1 score, and 99.37% AUC values in the ZJU dataset, while it was found to have 97.93% accuracy, 98.74% sensitivity, 97.15% specificity, 97.11% precision, 97.92% F 1 score, and 99.69% AUC values in the CEW dataset. Accordingly, when compared to CNN architectures, it scored the maximum performance. At the same time, the DCNN architecture proposed on the ZJU and CEW datasets has been confirmed to be an acceptable and productive solution for eye state recognition depending on the outcomes compared to the studies in the literature.

The mathematical model describing these dynamics forms the core of many solutions in non-linear control and deep reinforcement learning. Traditionally, the formulation of the dynamics involves Euler angle parametrization in the Lagrangian framework or quaternion parametrization in the Newton-Euler framework. The former has the disadvantage of giving birth to singularities and the latter being algorithmically complex. This work presents a hybrid solution, combining the benefits of both, namely a quaternion approach leveraging the Lagrangian framework, connecting the singularity-free parameterization with the algorithmic simplicity of the Lagrangian approach. We do so by offering detailed insights into the kinematic modeling process and the formulation of the dynamics of a general aerial manipulator.

FL allows a group of users (often referred to as clients ) to locally train a single machine learning model on their devices without sharing their raw data. One of the main challenges in FL is how to select the most appropriate clients to participate in the training of a certain task. In this paper, we address this challenge and propose a trust-based deep reinforcement learning approach to select the most adequate clients in terms of resource consumption and training time. On top of the client selection mechanism, we embed a transfer learning approach to handle the scarcity of data in some regions and compensate potential lack of learning at some servers.

As opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time. Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next step. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest amount of currently unexplored areas. Our method presents a novel deep learning-based navigation approach that is able to solve this problem and demonstrate its ability in an even more complicated setup, i.e., when computational power is limited.

Article,doi:10.1631/FITEE.2100594,Coach-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for unexpected crashed agents,Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering,10.1631/FITEE.2100594,Springer,7/1/2022,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning is difficult to apply in practice, partially because of the gap between simulated and real-world scenarios. One reason for the gap is that simulated systems always assume that agents can work normally all the time, while in practice, one or more agents may unexpectedly “crash” during the coordination process due to inevitable hardware or software failures. Such crashes destroy the cooperation among agents and lead to performance degradation. In this work, we present a formal conceptualization of a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning system with unexpected crashes. To enhance the robustness of the system to crashes, we propose a coach-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that introduces a virtual coach agent to adjust the crash rate during training. We have designed three coaching strategies (fixed crash rate, curriculum learning, and adaptive crash rate) and a re-sampling strategy for our coach agent. To our knowledge, this work is the first to study unexpected crashes in a multi-agent system. Extensive experiments on grid-world and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive strategy compared with the fixed crash rate strategy and curriculum learning strategy. The ablation study further illustrates the effectiveness of our re-sampling strategy. 多智能体强化学习在实际场景中很难应用, 一部分原因在于模拟环境和现实环境之间存在差距。造成这种差距的一个原因是, 模拟系统总是假设智能体可以一直正常工作, 而实际上, 由于不可避免的硬件或软件故障, 一个或多个智能体可能会在合作过程中意外 “崩溃”。这样的崩溃会破坏智能体之间的合作, 导致系统性能下降。本文中, 我们给出了意外崩溃情况下合作多智能体强化学习系统的正式定义。为增强系统应对崩溃时的鲁棒性, 提出教练辅助多智能体强化学习框架, 其在训练过程中引入一个虚拟教练智能体, 以调整系统的崩溃概率。为教练智能体设计了3种教练策略和重采样策略。据我们所知, 这是研究多智能体系统中意外崩溃情况的首项工作。在网格环境和星际争霸微管理任务上的大量实验表明, 相比固定崩溃概率和课程学习的教练策略, 自适应策略更加有效。消融实验进一步展现了重采样策略的有效性。",http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/FITEE.2100594,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fog computing-based real-time applications (Online gaming, 5G, Healthcare 4.0, Industrial IoT, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, augmented reality, and many more) are growing at a very fast pace. There are limited resources at the fog layer compared to the cloud, which leads to resource constraint problems. Edge resources need to be utilized efficiently to fulfill the growing demand for a large number of IoT devices. Lots of work has been done for the efficient utilization of edge resources. This paper provided a systematic review of fog resource management literature from the year 2016–2021. In this review paper, the fog resource management approaches are divided into 9 categories which include resource scheduling, application placement, load balancing, resource allocation, resource estimation, task offloading, resource provisioning, resource discovery, and resource orchestration. These resource management approaches are further subclassified based on the technology used, QoS factors, and data-driven strategies. Comparative analysis of existing articles is provided based on technology, tools, application area, and QoS factors. Further, future research prospects are discussed in the context of QoS factors, technique/algorithm, tools, applications, mobility support, heterogeneity, AI-based, distributed network, hierarchical network, and security.

The Data as a Service (DaaS) can provide this high-quality data for training efficient machine learning models.

In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning framework for secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving computational intelligence, called Decentralized Computational Intelligence as a Service (DCIaaS), is proposed. The proposed framework is able to improve data quality, computational intelligence quality, data equality, and computational intelligence equality for complex machine learning tasks. The proposed framework uses the blockchain network for secure decentralized transfer and sharing of data and machine learning models on the cloud. As a case study for multimedia applications, the performance of DCIaaS framework for biomedical image classification and hazardous litter management is analysed. Experimental results show an increase in the accuracy of the models trained using the proposed framework compared to decentralized training.

Many real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, traffic signals, and industrial automation can now be trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. These applications are designed to take benefit of DRL in order to improve the monitoring as well as measurements in industrial internet of things for automation identification system. The complexity of these environments means that it is more appropriate to use multi-agent systems rather than a single-agent. However, in non-stationary environments multi-agent systems can suffer from increased number of observations, limiting the scalability of algorithms. This study proposes a model to tackle the problem of scalability in DRL algorithms in transportation domain. A partition-based approach is used in the proposed model to reduce the complexity of the environment. This partition-based approach helps agents to stay in their working area. This reduces the complexity of the learning environment and the number of observations for each agent. The proposed model uses generative adversarial imitation learning and behavior cloning, combined with a proximal policy optimization algorithm, for training multiple agents in a dynamic environment. We present a comparison of PPO, soft actor-critic, and our model in reward gathering.

Existence of universal adversarial perturbations could empower the cases where could not generate the image-dependent adversarial examples, which are known to be very successful on image classification. Previous work are mainly optimization-based, which take a long time to search perturbations, and the obtained adversarial examples are not so real and can be easily defensed. Moreover the researches on universal adversarial perturbation against vision-language systems are few. In our work, we novelly construct a GenerAtive Network for Universal Adversarial Perturbations, dubbed as UAP-GAN, to study the robustness of image classification and captioning systems, based on convolutional neural networks and plus recurrent neural networks, respectively. Specifically, our proposed UAP-GAN improves the framework of GAN to compute universal adversarial perturbations, with the input of a fixed random noise. Comparing to existing methods, our UAP-GAN method has four main characteristics: fast generation, high attack success rate, close to natural image, yet difficult to defense. In addition, our proposed model could produce image-agnostic perturbations for targeted and non-targeted attacks, according to the selected scene. In the end, our comprehensive experiments on MSCOCO and ImageNet, demonstrate the clear superiority to the existing work, and also prove that our UAP-GAN architecture could effectively fool the image captioning and classification models with splendid results, yet avoid the redesign of framework for different tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-022-01058-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

First, it provides a critical analysis of current efforts to establish practical mechanisms for algorithmic auditing and assessment to identify limitations and gaps with these approaches.

Third, it generalises this method to incorporate wider ethical, social, and legal considerations, in turn establishing a novel version of argument-based assurance that we call ‘ethical assurance.’ Ethical assurance is presented as a structured method for unifying the myriad practical mechanisms that have been proposed. It is built on a process-based form of project governance that enlists reflective innovation practices to operationalise normative principles, such as sustainability, accountability, transparency, fairness, and explainability. As a set of interlocutory governance mechanisms that span across the data science and AI lifecycle, ethical assurance supports inclusive and participatory ethical deliberation while also remaining grounded in social and technical realities.

In autonomous driving, the appearance of incomplete point clouds that lose geometric and semantic information is inevitable due to the limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The existence of incomplete point clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to a reduction in the accuracy of object detection, traffic alerts, and collision avoidance for autonomous driving vehicles. Existing point cloud completion networks, such as the Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of point cloud completion without considering the efficiency of the inference process, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point cloud repair in autonomous driving. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving accurately and efficiently. In the proposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm that combines incremental sampling and one-time sampling is presented to improve the inference speed of the PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and autonomous driving scenes are created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5 different sizes are used for three autonomous driving situations. The improved PF-Net can achieve speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when compared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10723-022-09610-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many existing mobile applications have been developed to assist users in locating a nearby AED. However, these applications do not provide indoor navigation to the AED location. The time required to locate an AED inside a building due to a lack of indoor navigation systems will reduce the patient’s chance of survival. The existing indoor navigation solutions either require special hardware, a large dataset or a significant amount of initial work. These requirements make these systems not viable for implementation on a large-scale. Methods The proposed system collects Wi-Fi information from the existing devices and the path’s magnetic information using a smartphone to guide the user from a starting point to an AED. The information collected is processed using four techniques: turn detection method, Magnetic data pattern matching method, Wi-Fi fingerprinting method and Closest Wi-Fi location method to estimate user location. The user location estimations from all four techniques are further processed to determine the user’s location on the path, which is then used to guide the user to the AED location. Results The four techniques used in the proposed system Turn detection , Magnetic data pattern matching , Closest Wi-Fi location and Wi-Fi fingerprinting can individually achieve the accuracy of 80% with the error distance ± 9.4 m, ± 2.4 m, ± 4.6 m, and ± 4.6 m respectively. These four techniques, applied individually, may not always provide stable results. Combining these techniques results in a robust system with an overall accuracy of 80% with an error distance of ± 2.74 m. In comparison, the proposed system’s accuracy is higher than the existing systems that use Wi-Fi and magnetic data. Conclusion This research proposes a novel approach that requires no special hardware, large scale data or significant initial work to provide indoor navigation. The proposed system AEDNav can achieve an accuracy similar to the existing indoor navigation systems. Implementing this indoor navigation system could reduce the time to locate an AED and ultimately increase patient survival during sudden cardiac arrest.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-022-01886-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The provider typically allocates backup resources to mitigate the risk of violating the SLA-specified uptime guarantee. However, initial backups may need to be adjusted in response to real-time failure and recovery events. In this study, we first develop a recurrent intervention at fixed intervals (RIFI) strategy that allows the provider to adjust the allocation of backup resources such that the expected total cost is minimized. Next, we focus on the limit to number of interventions, starting from single intervention strategy, as frequent reallocations may be operationally disruptive. Particularly, we provide a cost minimization approach to guide the service providers in their virtual resources management, and a specific downtime minimization approach for more mission-critical applications as a more aggressive alternative. We present computational results exploring the impact of intervention on the likelihood of SLA violation for the rest of the contract period, and evaluate parameters such as time and quantum of resource level adjustment, penalty levels desired by clients, and their influences on the backup resource provisioning strategies. We also validate our models through the analysis of use cases from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

The existing model-free approaches for solving the synchronization problem in the presence of disturbances do not specify the rate of convergence, whereas this paper does. For this purpose, to ensure the synchronization of followers with the leader at the desired rate, a novel observer-based H ∞ control protocol is developed to prevent the effect of disturbance that propagates through the network. The problem is then formulated as an optimal control problem, and a modified off-policy RL algorithm is presented to solve the synchronization problem in real time without requiring any knowledge of the agents' dynamics. It is shown that the proposed method not only guarantees the synchronization of the normal agents but also attenuates the effect of disturbance both at the desired rate.

Despite systematic literature reviews identifying the main characteristics of existing tools and the SPL activities they support, these reviews do not always help to understand if such tools provide what complex variability projects demand. This paper presents an empirical research in which we evaluate the degree of maturity of existing SPL tools focusing on their support of variability modeling characteristics and SPL engineering activities required by current application domains. We first identify the characteristics and activities that are essential for the development of SPLs by analyzing a selected sample of case studies chosen from application domains with high variability. Second, we conduct an exploratory study to analyze whether the existing tools support those characteristics and activities. We conclude that, with the current tool support, it is possible to develop a basic SPL approach. But we have also found out that these tools present several limitations when dealing with complex variability requirements demanded by emergent application domains, such as non-Boolean features or large configuration spaces. Additionally, we identify the necessity for an integrated approach with appropriate tool support to completely cover all the activities and phases of SPL engineering.

This is an important methodological principle because not all systems can be secured, and totally securing a system is not feasible. Thus, we need to construct algorithms that will enable systems to continue operating even when parts of the system have been compromised. Furthermore, the article forecasts emerging cyber-risks from the integration of AI in cybersecurity.

However, to date, there has not been much direct comparison between the classical and emerging paradigms to this problem. In this article, we survey recent works that apply machine learning for motion planning and control in mobile robot navigation, within the context of classical navigation systems. The surveyed works are classified into different categories, which delineate the relationship of the learning approaches to classical methods. Based on this classification, we identify common challenges and promising future directions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-022-10039-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Even though AI-powered systems have brought competitive advantages, the black-box nature makes them lack transparency and prevents them from explaining their decisions. This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI. After offering the readers a solid XAI background, we analyze and review various XAI methods, which are grouped into (i) pre-modeling explainability, (ii) interpretable model, and (iii) post-modeling explainability. We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods. In addition, we systematically discuss various XAI challenges, such as the trade-off between the performance and the explainability, evaluation methods, security, and policy. Finally, we show the standard approaches that are leveraged to deal with the mentioned challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10462-021-10088-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The main objective behind our application is to reduce maintenance costs by developing an integrated system based on a robotic arm to operate on the RBS front plane. This work details the challenges and solutions for maintaining the connectivity of networking cables in such an environment. More specifically, it discusses the problems of inserting communication cables and removing defective ones attached to an RBS equipment. We also examine the creation and evolution of a maintenance system from a simulation scenario to a real-world setup. RBOT’s interface allows both remote teleoperation and autonomous operation. It also contains Augmented Reality features providing a first-person view for remote teleoperation to increase environmental awareness. Furthermore, by applying convolutional neural networks for faulty cable classification, RBOT can actuate over the RBS and manipulate the cables with a unique, accurate, and robust gripper we specially designed for cable connector handling.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41315-021-00206-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The key criteria for a comprehensive understanding of the driving situations are proper perception and localization. The research on perception and localization of autonomous cars has increased substantially as a result of recent breakthroughs in AI, such as the wide range of deep learning approaches. However, owing to environmental uncertainties, sensor noise, and the complex interaction between the parts of the driving environment, additional study is required to achieve totally trustworthy perception and localization systems.

Due to the high demand for autonomous exploration, patrolling and inspection services and a rapid improvement of batteries, sensors and machine learning algorithms, the quality of localisation becomes even more important for smart robotic systems. The underwater domain is a very challenging environment due to the water blocking most of the signals over short distances. Recent results in localisation techniques for underwater vehicles are summarised in two principal categories: passive techniques, which strive to provide the best estimation of the vehicle’s position (global or local) given the past and current information from sensors, and active techniques, which additionally produce guidance output that is expected to minimise the uncertainty of estimated position.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41315-021-00215-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The 5G technologies have not been fully commercialized and the researchers have started exploring the 6G technologies. The 6G technologies can help provide ultra-low latency communication between the devices.

High throughput phenotyping (HTP) involves the application of these tools to phenotype the plants and can vary from ground-based imaging to aerial phenotyping to remote sensing. Adoption of these HTP tools has tried to reduce the phenotyping bottleneck in breeding programs and help to increase the pace of genetic gain. More specifically, several root phenotyping tools are discussed to study the plant’s hidden half and an area long neglected. However, the use of these HTP technologies produces big data sets that impede the inference from those datasets. Machine learning and deep learning provide an alternative opportunity for the extraction of useful information for making conclusions. These are interdisciplinary approaches for data analysis using probability, statistics, classification, regression, decision theory, data visualization, and neural networks to relate information extracted with the phenotypes obtained. These techniques use feature extraction, identification, classification, and prediction criteria to identify pertinent data for use in plant breeding and pathology activities. This review focuses on the recent findings where machine learning and deep learning approaches have been used for plant stress phenotyping with data being collected using various HTP platforms. We have provided a comprehensive overview of different machine learning and deep learning tools available with their potential advantages and pitfalls. Overall, this review provides an avenue for studying various HTP platforms with particular emphasis on using the machine learning and deep learning tools for drawing legitimate conclusions.

However, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules. This makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains and limits their potential efficacy. In this paper, we investigate how feedback in a large-scale ITS can be automatically generated in a data-driven way, and more specifically how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student performance outcomes. First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations . Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit , a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019.

These networks may be wired or wireless. Modern improvements in wireless infrastructure brought wireless sensor networks (WSN) into existence. WSN is utilized to monitor, report, and supervise tasks or events occurring in the environment. The relaying of data in such systems takes place by utilizing different routing schemes. These routing schemes were proposed to augment the throughput of communication networks. In addition, perception regarding the Internet of Things (IoT) gained momentum via making it feasible for things to interact and act smartly. In this paper, a meticulous survey of solutions proposed in both the domains i.e. WSN and IoT is conferred.

The transmission of data (to and fro) related to these applications occur between the drones and the other infrastructure over wireless channels that must abide to the stringent latency restrictions. However, relaying this data to the core cloud infrastructure may lead to a higher round trip delay. Thus, we utilize the cloud close to the ground, i.e., edge computing to realize an edge-envisioned IoD ecosystem. However, as this data is relayed over an open communication channel, it is often prone to different types of attacks due to it wider attack surface. Thus, we need to find a robust solution that can maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data while providing desired services. Blockchain technology is capable to handle these challenges owing to the distributed ledger that store the data immutably. However, the conventional block architecture pose several challenges because of limited computational capabilities of drones. As the size of blockchain increases, the data flow also increases and so does the associated challenges. Hence, to overcome these challenges, in this work, we have proposed a derived blockchain architecture that decouples the data part (or block ledger) from the block header and shifts it to off-chain storage. In our approach, the registration of a new drone is performed to enable legitimate access control thus ensuring identity management and traceability. Further, the interactions happen in the form of transactions of the blockchain. We propose a lightweight consensus mechanism based on the stochastic selection followed by a transaction signing process to ensure that each drone is in control of its block. The proposed scheme also handles the expanding storage requirements with the help of data compression using a shrinking block mechanism. Lastly, the problem of additional delay anticipated due to drone mobility is handled using a multi-level caching mechanism. The proposed work has been validated in a simulated Gazebo environment and the results are promising in terms of different metrics.

One of the most extensively used strategies for big data classification is MapReduce, which combines the map and reduce processes. For filtering and sorting, the mapping approach is employed, and the reduction technique is used to combine the final classification results. A novel Archerfish Hunter Spotted Hyena Optimization-based Improved Extreme Learning Machine (AHSHO-IELM) classifier-based MapReduce framework is proposed in this paper for big data classification. The IELM algorithm is formed by integrating the ELM technique with Principal Component Analysis to overcome the multicollinear problem and enhance the training and testing time. The AHSHO method combines the archerfish hunter optimization and Spotted Hyena Optimization algorithms to improve the optimal parameter selection of the IELM classifier, which increases classification accuracy and reduces the error rate. The performance of the proposed AHSHO-IELM classifier-based MapReduce framework is evaluated using different performance metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Computational time, F1-Score, Mathews correlation coefficient, and scale-up factor.

In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a confidence calibration method for deep neural networks by designing one novel knowledge reverse distillation strategy. Traditional knowledge distillation strategy takes the accuracy as the knowledge, and transfers it from the teacher network (usually one complex deep network) to the student network (usually one simple network). Different from this traditional distillation strategy, the proposed knowledge reverse distillation strategy regards the confidence as the knowledge, and constructs one reverse knowledge transfer pathway by applying the confidence knowledge in the simple network to calibrate the complex deep network. Experimental results on three benchmark image datasets show that the knowledge reverse distillation strategy can effectively improve the calibration capability of complex networks so that the complex deep neural network captures the high confidence along with the high prediction accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-022-10885-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Vehicles continuously exchange and collect information to provide innovative transportation services; for example, traffic management, navigation, autonomous driving, and the generation of alerts. However, VANETs are extremely challenging for data collection, due to their high mobility and dynamic network topologies that cause frequent link disruptions and make path discovery difficult. In this survey, various state-of-the-art data collection protocols for VANETs are discussed, based on three broad categories, i.e., delay-tolerant, best-effort, and real-time protocols. A taxonomy is designed for data collection protocols for VANETs that is essential to add precision and ease of understandability. A detailed comparative analysis among various data collection protocols is provided to highlight their functionalities and features. Protocols are evaluated based on three parametric phases. First, protocols investigation based on six necessary parameters, including delivery and drop ratio, efficiency, and recovery strategy. Second, a 4-D functional framework is designed to fit most data collection protocols for quick classification and mobility model identification, thus eradicating the need to read extensive literature. In the last, in-depth categorical mapping is performed to deep dive for better and targeted interpretation.

In critiquing focus on the drone’s apparent ‘autonomy’, it argues that such devices function as part of a socio-technical network. They are relational parts of human–machine interaction that, in our changing geopolitical realities, have a powerful influence on politics, reputation and warfare. Drawing on Žižek’s conception of parallax, the article stresses the importance of culture and perception in forming the role of the drone in widening power asymmetries. It examines how perceptions of autonomy are evoked by drones, to claim that this misperception is a smokescreen that obscures the relational socio-technical realities of the drone. The article therefore argues that a more critical culture of the drone emerges by shifting the focus and perception from autonomy to anonymity. This allows us to engage more fully with the distributed agency and decision-making that define how drones are developed and deployed. Rather than focusing on the drone as a singular, fetishised, technical object, a relational approach to the drone assemblage is proposed that highlights the competing human interests that define and resist drones in global politics and culture.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01042-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, most existing works treat each video frame equally and ignore their temporal interactions. To overcome this drawback, a few methods try to select some key frames and then perform attacks based on them. Unfortunately, their selection strategy is independent of the attacking step, therefore the resulting performance is limited. Instead, we argue the frame selection phase is closely relevant with the attacking phase. The key frames should be adjusted according to the attacking results. For that, we formulate the black-box video attacks into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Specifically, the environment in RL is set as the recognition model, and the agent in RL plays the role of frame selecting. By continuously querying the recognition models and receiving the attacking feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its frame selection strategy and adversarial perturbations become smaller and smaller. We conduct a series of experiments with two mainstream video recognition models: C3D and LRCN on the public UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the adversarial perturbations with efficient query times.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-022-01604-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such issues concern all stakeholders involved in or committed to the design, implementation, deployment, and use of the technology. The present document addresses these preoccupations by introducing and discussing a set of practical obligations and recommendations for the development of applications and systems based on AI techniques. With this work we hope to contribute to spreading awareness on the many social challenges posed by AI and encouraging the establishment of good practices throughout the relevant social areas. As points of novelty, the paper elaborates on an integrated view that combines both human rights and ethical concepts to reap the benefits of the two approaches. Moreover, it proposes innovative recommendations, such as those on redress and governance, which add further insight to the debate.

Pro-social rule breaking as a moral enhancement approach for ethical AI,AI & SOCIETY,10.1007/s00146-022-01478-z,Springer,5/23/2022,"We are moving towards a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) based agents make many decisions on behalf of humans. From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a study that introduces a ‘ vaccination strategy dilemma’ to human participants and analyzes their response. In this dilemma , one needs to decide whether they would distribute COVID-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm.

Therefore, the present study investigates how investors respond to announcements of new product innovations integrated with AI by non-software firms (AI-NPIs), with the prediction that they respond favorably if the firms feature a marketing department with substantial power; such firms likely possess the marketing resources and assets needed to ensure the success of AI-NPIs. An event study with a sample of 341 announcements by 77 S&P 500 firms between 2009–2018 supports this prediction.

Affected by GPS equipment precision and driving environments, raw GPS trajectories will deviate from the paths that vehicles really drove on. Such inaccurate data is not beneficial to the upstream applications. Therefore, map matching is applied to identify the true driving paths in the road network from the GPS trajectories data. A lot of studies in the filed of map matching have been proposed, but there still exist three problems: (1) there lacks a comprehensive review on recent map matching algorithms with new techniques; (2) the existing map-matching algorithms still fail to meet the requirements of both high precision and high efficiency simultaneously; (3) there is a lack of comparison between various types of matching algorithms on a unified experimental environment. In this paper, we review the existing matching algorithms and propose a new categorisation based on their methodologies. The proposed categorisation can better reveal their properties and facilitate the future utilization.

Such systems are increasingly ubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable situations where moral responsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any particular person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been proposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans; however, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet inexistent, making the development of AI-based systems that remain under meaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying, through an iterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for AI-based systems under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of two applications scenarios: automated vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate and mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a human should be commensurate with that human’s ability and authority to control the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We argue that these four properties will support practically minded professionals to take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that facilitate meaningful human control.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-022-00167-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most of the data has been collected using the Internet of Things (IoT) devices which must be saved in the cloud for further analysis. Intermediate access or unauthorized users trying to access sensitive information during the data storage causes data confidentiality, integrity, and privacy-related issues. The IoT devices are integrated with fog computing to carry out the specific computation, latency, and storage over the internet backbone. However, the IoT with Fog computing process ensures the enormous way of managing data security, data latency, privacy, and security are significant issues.

Initially, the cluster heads are identified according to the power probabilistic criteria, and the clustering process is performed for making the data transmission in the fog systems. During data transmission, data security is managed by applying the noise protocol framework encryption process. The encryption technique utilized the various cryptographic functions that effectively manage the privacy and security of the data.

Recently, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has shown significant potential to strengthen the notion of smart cities equipped with smart parking.

The proposed framework is consist of smart cameras, fog nodes, and a cloud server. The DRL is used in fog devices to classify the vehicles and intelligently allocate the vacant parking slots to vehicles. The smart cameras are deployed at the entry point of the parking space and in the parking lanes as well. The ground cameras capture the image, detect the vehicle and transmit the information to the fog node. On the fog node, the online deep Q-learning algorithm updates the reward score. The proposed framework helps to recognize the vehicle, identify the vacant parking slot for the vehicle in minimum time with high accuracy.

When multiple services running on the resource-constrained CAVs, how limited resources can dynamically support the desired services is of the utmost importance for both automakers and domain researchers. In this context, efficiently and dynamically managing vehicle services becomes critical for autonomous driving. While previous research focused on service scheduling, computation offloading, and virtual machine migration, we propose EdgeWare, an extensible and flexible middleware to manage the execution of vehicle services, which is open-source to the community with four key features: i ) on-demand model switch, i.e.,  easily switch and upgrade machine learning models, ii ) function consolidation and deduplication to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating functions and maximize the reusability of vehicle services, iii ) build event-driven applications to reduce workload, and iv ) dynamic workflow customization which enables customizing workflow to extend the functionality. Our experiment results show that EdgeWare accelerates the execution of services about 2.6 $$\times$$ × faster compared to the silo approach and save CPU and memory utilization up to around 50% and 17% respectively, and it allows domain researchers to dynamically add new services on CAVs or easily switch to the upgraded applications for the life cycle management of vehicle services.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42514-022-00100-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the literature many end-to-end methods have been used in simulators to drive a car and to apply the learnt strategies to avoid the obstacles using the lane changing, following the vehicle as per the traffic rules, driving in-between the lane boundaries, and many more behaviors. The proposed method is designed to avoid obstacles in the scenarios where a dynamic obstacle is headed directly towards the robot from different directions. To avoid the critical encounter of the dynamic obstacles, we trained a novel deep neural network (DNN) with two specific behavioral obstacle avoidance strategies, namely “head-on collision avoidance” and “stop and move” . These two strategies of obstacle avoidance come from the human behavior of obstacle avoidance. Looking at the current frame only, for a very similar visual display of the scenario, the two strategies have contrasting outputs and overall outcomes that makes learning very difficult. A random data recording over general simulations is unlikely to record the corner cases of both behaviors that rarely occur, and a behavior-specific training used in this paper intensifies the same cases for a better learning of the robot in such corner cases. We calculate the intention of the obstacle, whether it will move or not.

In this context, knowledge representation and processing have recently shown a significant contribution to the simulation modeling domain, where knowledge graphs have been used in different fields to build knowledge representations for multiple purposes. In this paper, we introduce VOWES, a Virtual Outdoor Weather Event Simulator to replicate and measure outdoor weather events in vivid 3D visualizations. We design and implement an integrated knowledge graph (KG) representation for VOWES, by creating two constituent KGs: (i) Weather KG describing weather data and events, and (ii) Simulator KG describing 3D simulation components and properties, and connecting them with the (iii) Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) KG to form an integrated structure serving as the knowledge backbone of the VOWES simulation environment. We make use of the Unity 3D engine to build and design the simulator environment and its virtual sensors, and integrate the Mapbox SDK and the WeatherStack API for realistic real-world weather mapping. We have conducted qualitative evaluations involving 13 expert and 30 non-expert testers, to assess the quality of VOWES’ KGs and its simulation environment. Results show that more than 80% of the testers gave a combined quality score ≥ 3 out of 4 on most evaluation criteria. We have also conducted performance evaluations to test VOWES loading, execution, and data search time, among other features. Results show that most operations require almost instantaneous or linear time, where search, refresh, and export operations share almost identical performance levels, with execution time increasing by approximately 179 μs for every added game object.

Thereby, however, significant ethical concerns arise, including issues of fairness, privacy and human autonomy. By aggregating current concerns and criticisms, we identify five crucial shortcomings of the current debate on the ethics of AI. On the threshold of a third wave of AI ethics, we find that the field eventually fails to take sufficient account of the business context and deep societal value conflicts the use of AI systems may evoke. For even a perfectly fair AI system, regardless of its feasibility, may be ethically problematic, a too narrow focus on the ethical implications of technical systems alone seems insufficient. Therefore, we introduce a business ethics perspective based on the normative theory of contractualism and conceptualise ethical implications as conflicts between values of diverse stakeholders. We argue that such value conflicts can be resolved by an account of deliberative order ethics holding that stakeholders of an economic community deliberate the costs and benefits and agree on rules for acceptable trade-offs when AI systems are employed. This allows AI ethics to consider business practices, to recognise the role of firms, and ethical AI not being at risk to provide a competitive disadvantage or in conflict with the current functioning of economic markets. By introducing deliberative order ethics, we thus seek to do justice to the fundamental normative and political dimensions at the core of AI ethics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-021-00047-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the continually changing topology and lack of security infrastructure, routing protocols in VANET are vulnerable to several attacks. In this paper, we focus on the black hole and the gray hole attacks due to its severity. In black hole and gray hole attacks, the attacker gains access to the wireless network and drops the received packets fully/selectively that impacts on the safety applications of VANET. This paper presents a novel security approach called Smart Blackhole and Gray hole Mitigation (SBGM) to detect and mitigate both black hole and gray hole nodes in VANET using a time series analysis of the dropped packets of each node. The computation of the packet drop distance threshold based on Dynamic Time Warping improves the detection accuracy in SBGM. We assess the performance of SBGM using AODV and OLSR routing protocols under low-dense and high-dense traffic scenarios in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, Throughput, Average End-to-End Delay, and Packet Drop percentage.

Everyone makes use of their vehicles like two-wheelers or four-wheelers to reach the destination. Vehicle condition plays a major role which includes many parameters such as tyre condition, engine overheating, low fuel mileage. This paper concentrates on the examination of tyre track design for deformities. The mileage of a vehicle relies upon different components. However, it depends on different parameters like street condition, tyre weight and numerous others. For smooth driving and for safe traffic reasons, the auspicious maintenance of tyres plays a vital task. Consequently, the likelihood of prediction of tyre imperfections is assumed to play a vital role to fleet proprietors, government and tyre makers. Researchers make use of recent technologies such as machine learning and deep learning concepts to provide a solution to various real-life problems. The creation of a weighted quality-based convolutional neural network with the purpose of discovery of imperfections on tyres by the examination of pictures of tyre track designs is being proposed. The proposed system with the accessible data-set made public by different tyre producers is included for evaluation. The consequences of our tests demonstrate that it is conceivable to predict the deformities and durability of a tyre from its track designs through a weighted quality-based convolutional neural network. The proposed methodology is used to identify the group of feature values from the tyre image. These kinds of feature values are utilized to implement the dissimilarity of the feature related pixels. The number of epochs is varied as a callback mechanism has been used to validate the proposed model. Binary accuracy and mean absolute error are the best metrics to evaluate the performance which are discussed in the results section. Also, precision, recall and F-measure are used as validation parameters for the proposed model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-06878-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, locating equipment in such GPS denied environments is very time consuming due to the complexity of the environment and the large amount of equipment. To address this challenge we investigate an alternative approach to study the navigation problem based on visual imagery data instead of current ad-hoc methods where engineering drawings or large CAD models are used to find equipment. In particular, this paper investigates the combination of deep learning and decomposition for the image retrieval problem which is central for visual navigation. A convolutional neural network is first used to extract relevant features from the image database. The database is then decomposed into clusters of visually similar images, where several algorithms have been explored in order to make the clusters as independent as possible. The Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach is then applied on each cluster to build a vocabulary forest. During the searching process the vocabulary forest is exploited to find the most relevant images to the query image. To validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, intensive experiments have been carried out using both standard datasets and images from industrial environments. We show that the suggested approach outperforms the BoW-based image retrieval solutions, both in terms of computing time and accuracy. We also show the applicability of this approach on real industrial scenarios by applying the model on imagery data from offshore oil platforms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-021-02908-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Processing generated data from IoT devices and actuation warranted in real-time requires computational infrastructure near the edge to get the outcome without delay. Emerging edge technologies such as Fog computing, Multi-Access Edge Computing, and Cloudlet provide computing resources near the edge, i.e. closer to the IoT devices, where devices can place their services/applications or offload their computational job for processing. The utilization of computing resources provided by emerging edge technologies addresses the issue of delay in the outcome and increases the battery life of IoT devices/End-user devices. Computational resources provided by the edge technologies, i.e. edge/fog nodes, can be heterogeneous, dynamic and mobile. Therefore, service placement and computation offloading on edge/fog nodes are challenging issues, and the problem to finding the best suitable fog/edge nodes is NP-Hard. Nature-inspired algorithms provide robust solutions to NP-Hard problems. Nowadays, nature-inspired algorithms have been widely applied for resource allocation for service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge technologies. In this work, we provide a detailed study on the applications of nature-inspired algorithms in emerging edge computing domains. We provide an overview of emerging edge technologies, related quality parameters and nature-inspired algorithms followed by the basic formulation of service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge computing systems. In this work, we classify the works in emerging edge computing applying nature-inspired algorithms into two categories: works related to service placement and works related to offloading.

Directly applying existing models to tackle real-time pedestrian and vehicle detection tasks captured by high speed moving vehicle scenarios has two problems. First, the target scale varies drastically because the vehicle speed changes greatly. Second, captured images contain both tiny targets and high density targets, which brings in occlusion between targets. To solve the two issues, an efficient light weight real-time detection algorithm is proposed, which is referred to as EfficientLiteDet. Based on Tiny-YOLOv4, one more prediction head is introduced in the proposed model to detect multi-scale targets effectively. In order to detect tiny and occluded denser targets, we used Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) instead of original anchor detection heads in our model. To explore the potential of self-attention mechanism in TPH, the proposed model integrates “convolutional block attention model” to locate crucial attention region on scenarios with denser targets. Further to improve the detection performance of our model, we applied various data augmentation strategies such as mosaic, mix-up, multi-scale, and random-horizontal-flip during the model training. Extensive experiments are conducted on five challenging pedestrian and vehicle datasets shows that the EfficientLiteDet model has better performance in real-time scenarios. On Pascal Voc-2007, Highway and Udacity datasets, the proposed model achieves mean average precision (mAP) 87.3%, 80.1% and 77.8%, respectively, which is quite better than Tiny-YOLOv4 state-of-the-art algorithm by + 2.4%, 1.8% and + 2.4%, respectively.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00138-022-01293-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The first task is a speaker recognition application, trying to identify five different speakers. The second one is a speech command identification where the goal is to classify ten voice commands. These two tasks are very important to make the communication between humans and smart devices as smooth and natural as possible. The emergence of smart home devices such as personal assistants and the deployment of audio based applications in noisy environments raise new challenges and reveal the weaknesses of existing speech recognition systems. Despite the advances of deep learning in audio tasks, most of the proposed architectures are computationally inefficient and very sensitive to noise. This research addresses these problems by proposing two neural architectures that incorporate a novel pooling operation, named entropy pooling. Entropy pooling is based on the principle of maximum entropy. A detailed ablation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of entropy pooling against the classic max and average pooling layers. The neural networks that are developed are based on two architectures, convolutional networks and residual ones. The study shows that entropy based feature pooling improves the robustness of these architectures in the presence of noise.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12931-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, including it in so-called “safety-critical” systems such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification approaches. Objective This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question “How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?”. Method We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 and 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness , Uncertainty , Explainability , Verification , Safe Reinforcement Learning , and Direct Certification . We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted. Results The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of ML models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study.

In this context, a social robot that adapts its behaviour to different users and proactively suggests their favourite activities may produce a more successful interaction. In this work, we describe how the autonomous decision-making system embedded in our social robot Mini can produce a personalised interactive communication experience by considering the preferences of the user the robot interacts with. We compared the performance of Top Label as Class and Ranking by Pairwise Comparison, two promising algorithms in the area, to find the one that best predicts the user preferences. Although both algorithms provide robust results in preference prediction, we decided to integrate Ranking by Pairwise Comparison since it provides better estimations. The method proposed in this contribution allows the autonomous decision-making system of the robot to work on different modes, balancing activity exploration with the selection of the favourite entertaining activities. The operation of the preference learning system is shown in three real case studies where the decision-making system works differently depending on the user the robot is facing. Then, we conducted a human–robot interaction experiment to investigate whether the robot users perceive the personalised selection of activities more appropriate than selecting the activities at random. The results show how the study participants found the personalised activity selection more appropriate, improving their likeability towards the robot and how intelligent they perceive the system. query Please check the edit made in the article title.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-022-09321-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

BEVs use electric motors rather than fossil fuels for propulsion and typically store electric energy in lithium-ion cells. With rising concerns over fossil fuel depletion and the impact of ICE vehicles on the climate, electric mobility is widely considered as the future of sustainable transportation. BEVs promise to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the transportation sector. However, mass adoption of BEVs faces major barriers due to consumer worries over several important battery-related issues, such as limited range, long charging time, lack of charging stations, and high initial cost. Existing solutions to overcome these barriers, such as building more charging stations, increasing battery capacity, and stationary vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging, often suffer from prohibitive investment costs, incompatibility to existing BEVs, or long travel delays. In this paper, we propose P eer-to- P eer C ar C harging (P2C2), a scalable approach for charging BEVs that alleviates the need for elaborate charging infrastructure. The central idea is to enable BEVs to share charge among each other while in motion through coordination with a cloud-based control system. To re-vitalize a BEV fleet, which is continuously in motion, we introduce Mobile Charging Stations (MoCS), which are high-battery-capacity vehicles used to replenish the overall charge in a vehicle network. Unlike existing V2V charging solutions, the charge sharing in P2C2 takes place while the BEVs are in-motion, which aims at minimizing travel time loss. To reduce BEV-to-BEV contact time without increasing manufacturing costs, we propose to use multiple batteries of varying sizes and charge transfer rates. The faster but smaller batteries are used for charge transfer between vehicles, while the slower but larger ones are used for prolonged charge storage. We have designed the overall P2C2 framework and formalized the decision-making process of the cloud-based control system. We have evaluated the effectiveness of P2C2 using a well-characterized simulation platform and observed dramatic improvement in BEV mobility. Additionally, through statistical analysis, we show that a significant reduction in carbon emission is also possible if MoCS can be powered by renewable energy sources.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08942-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Smart vehicles understand the environment through multi-sensor, network, and pervasive systems for gaining useful information. The problem arises with the absence of useful information in explicit scenarios where heterogeneous information becomes mandatory. This article aims to improve transportation support's effectiveness using a discrete behavior information fusion (DBIF) based on the deep learning technique by considering the contradiction in information availability. This proposed technique observes the vehicles' behavior and response to the scene throughout the route displacement. The deep learning model achieves greater accuracy in target detection and classification. The learning output is the independent fusion of behavior (response output) and information (sensed). This sensed information is useful in categorizing further deviations and stipulations for the progressive displacements. The stipulated information and its deviations are recurrently categorized using support vector machine learning. The information provides accurate positioning and tracking of smart vehicles by reducing approximation errors and complexity. The simulation results illustrate the proposed technique's efficiency by improving the accuracy of 92.078% and fusion rate of 0.9741 and reducing error of 0.0662, complexity of 0.0717, and fusion time of 0.9938 compared to existing methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-021-04115-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many deep learning-based algorithms using two-dimensional images have become an essential tool for autonomous vehicles with object detection, tracking, and segmentation for road target detection, primarily including pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on visual data to classify and generalize target objects which can satisfy pedestrians’ and other vehicles’ safety requirements in their environment. In real-time, outstanding results are obtained by deep learning-based algorithms for object detection. While several studies have thoroughly examined different types of deep learning-based object detection methods, there are a few comparable studies that either test the detection speed or accuracy of the object detection algorithms. In addition to speed and accuracy, autonomous driving also depends on model size and energy efficiency. However, there is a lack of comparison on various such metrics among existing deep learning-based methods. This article aims to provide a detailed and systematic comparative analysis of five independent mainstream deep learning-based algorithms for road object detection, namely the R-FCN, Mask R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, and YOLOv4 on a large-scale Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD100K) dataset. The experimental results are analyzed using the mean Average Precision (mAP) value and inference time. Additionally, various practical metrics, such as model size, computational complexity, and energy efficiency of deep learning-based models are precisely computed. Furthermore, the performance of each algorithm is evaluated under different road environmental conditions at various times of day and night.

The results illustrate that both cost efficiencies and new revenue streams can be realised, as the insurance business model will shift from loss compensation to loss prediction and prevention. Moreover, we identify two possible developments with respect to the insurability of risks. The first is that the application of artificial intelligence by insurance companies might allow for a more accurate prediction of loss probabilities, thus reducing one of the industry’s most inherent problems, namely asymmetric information.

We consider in this paper a federated learning scenario wherein the local training is carried out on IoT devices and the global aggregation is done at the level of an edge server. One essential challenge in this emerging approach is IoT devices selection (also called scheduling), i.e., how to select the IoT devices to participate in the distributed training process. The existing approaches suggest to base the scheduling decision on the resource characteristics of the devices to guarantee that the selected devices would have enough resources to carry out the training. In this work, we argue that trust should be an integral part of the decision-making process and therefore design a trust establishment mechanism between the edge server and IoT devices. The trust mechanism aims to detect those IoT devices that over-utilize or under-utilize their resources during the local training. Thereafter, we introduce DDQN-Trust, a double deep Q learning-based selection algorithm that takes into account the trust scores and energy levels of the IoT devices to make appropriate scheduling decisions. Finally, we integrate our solution into four federated learning aggregation approaches, namely, FedAvg , FedProx , FedShare and FedSGD . Experiments conducted using a real-world dataset show that our DDQN-Trust solution always achieves better performance compared to two main benchmarks: the DQN and random scheduling algorithms. The results also reveal that FedProx outperforms the competitor aggregation models in terms of accuracy when integrated into our DDQN-Trust solution.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-022-01078-1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

During the last decade, a significant effort has been made by researchers to model and predict the exact time a driver starts a lane changing maneuver and to investigate the factors that may affect the above decision. However, lane changing at intersections remains an under-researched area due to the complexity of the maneuvers and the need for very detailed trajectory data. In this paper, a methodology for modeling the likelihood of lane changing at intersections is proposed based on a comprehensive feature extraction mechanism, which attempts to quantify the favorability of the surrounding environment towards lane changing and simple LSTM modeling structures. The models are trained on data coming from a highly congested intersection in the city of Athens (Greece). Findings indicate that the proposed lane changing model trained to predict the occurrence of a lane changing maneuver within 1 and 5 s ahead, achieves an accuracy of about 96% for both applications (single step and multiple step prediction). These results show strong evidence that, regardless of the complexity of the problem at hand, simple predictive deep learning architectures enhanced with meaningful spatio-temporal representation and related features can achieve a high level of performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42421-022-00055-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, training a deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labelled images, which can be expensive to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners are required. To address this, a number of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different hospitals and clinics, which can be used to pre-train the model. However, using models trained on these datasets for later transfer learning and model fine-tuning with images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets, which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols. In this work, a real-world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the novel target dataset, is evaluated. A common approach to further improve the model’s performance under such small labelled target dataset setting is data augmentation. However, often cheaper unlabelled data is available from the target clinic. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning, which leverages both labelled and unlabelled data, can be used in such conditions. In this work, we evaluate the semi-supervised deep learning approach known as MixMatch, to take advantage of unlabelled data from the target dataset, for whole mammogram image classification. We compare the usage of semi-supervised learning on its own, and combined with transfer learning (from a source mammogram dataset) with data augmentation, as also against regular supervised learning with transfer learning and data augmentation from source datasets. It is shown that the use of a semi-supervised deep learning combined with transfer learning and data augmentation can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labelled observations. Also, we found a strong influence of the source dataset, which suggests a more data-centric approach needed to tackle the challenge of scarcely labelled data. We used several different metrics to assess the performance gain of using semi-supervised learning, when dealing with very imbalanced test datasets (such as the G-mean and the F2-score), as mammogram datasets are often very imbalanced. Graphical Abstract Description of the test-bed implemented in this work. Two different source data distributions were used to fine-tune the different models tested in this work.

In contrast with the most existing work that deals with demand uncertainty using predefined probability distributions, the learning-based framework is capable of handling demand uncertainty by learning the intrinsic pattern from large-scale historical data and computing high quality solutions. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct a group of numerical experiments based on New York taxicab trip record data set. The experimental results show that our proposed data-driven approach outperforms the parametric approaches and deterministic model in terms of business profit, relocation rate, and value of stochastic solution (VSS). Most significantly, compared with the deterministic approach, the vehicle relocation rates are reduced by approximate 80%, 70% and 40% under small fleet size, medium fleet size and large fleet size, respectively. In addition, the VSS of our approach is more than 3 times higher than the one of Poisson distribution by average.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13177-021-00269-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

ADAS involves several advanced approaches such as automotive electronics, vehicular communication, RADAR, LIDAR, computer vision, and its associated aspects such as machine learning and deep learning. Of these, computer vision and machine learning-based solutions have mainly been effective that have allowed real-time vehicle control, driver-aided systems, etc. However, most of the existing works deal with ADAS deployment and autonomous driving functionality in countries with well-disciplined lane traffic. These solutions and frameworks do not work in countries and cities with less-disciplined/ chaotic traffic. Hence, critical ADAS functionalities and even L2/ L3 autonomy levels in driving remain a major open challenge. In this regard, this work proposes a novel framework called Auto-Alert. Auto-Alert performs a two-stage spatial and temporal analysis based on external traffic environment and tri-axial sensor system for safe driving assistance. This work investigates time-series analysis with deep learning models for driving events prediction and assistance. Further, as a basic premise, various essential design considerations towards the ADAS are discussed. Significantly, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models are applied in the proposed Auto-Alert. It is shown that the LSTM outperforms the CNN with 99% for the considered window length. Importantly, this also involves developing and demonstrating an efficient traffic monitoring and density estimation system. Further, this work provides the benchmark results for Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), specifically for the object detection task. The findings of this proposed work demonstrate the significance of using CNN and LSTM networks to assist the driver in the holistic traffic environment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13177-021-00272-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Autonomous driving solutions are well established for urban rail transportation systems. Many metro lines in service worldwide have reached the highest grade of automation where the train is automatically operated without any staff on board. However, autonomous driving is still an open challenge for mainline trains, due to the complexity of the mainline environment. In this context, automated recognition of wayside signals can help to minimise the risk of human error owing to low visibility and fatigue. It represents a key step towards the fully autonomous train. In this article we present a deep learning based approach for the above task. The You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) is used for detection and recognition of wayside signals. A heuristic is used to recognise blinking states. We consider FRSign dataset, a large collection of over 100,000 images of traffic signals from some of the trains in French Railways. A distilled and cleaned version of the dataset curated by us is used for training. The trained network has low computational overhead and can recognise traffic signals in real time and under diverse field conditions. It has robust performance even for complex scenes having multiple signals and light sources, and in adverse circumstances such as rain and night environments.

Traditional ML and DL approaches that operate with data stored on a centralized server raise major privacy problems for user data. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of a smart sensing network demands lightweight security solutions. To address these issues, this article proposes a Federated Learning (FL)-based attack detection framework for VSN. The proposed scheme utilizes a group of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with a Random Forest (RF)-based ensembler unit. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is investigated through multiple performance metrics. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed FL approach successfully detected the cyberattacks in VSN with the highest accuracy of 99.52%.

Human activity recognition now offers a solution for fall detection systems that assist older people at home. A fall detection system that responds promptly to fatal falls can help to reduce the fall severity. Fall detection systems are developed using wearable environmental sensors and video data. Wearable devices are not always feasible as they cause inconvenience to the user. Hence, our paper presents a new promising solution for fall detection using vision-based approaches. In this approach, we analyse the human joint points which are the prime motion indicators. A set of key points of the subject are acquired by applying the AlphaPose pre-trained network. These keypoints are inferred to be the joint points of the subject. The acquired keypoints are processed through a framework of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. Here, the spatial correlation of the keypoints is analysed. The long-term dependencies are then preserved with the help of long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. Our system detects five types of falls and six types of daily living activities. We used the UP-FALL detection dataset for validating our fall detection system and achieved commendable results when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

However, dealing with a large amount of vehicular data that keep growing in the urban environment is still an critical challenge for IDSs. This paper, therefore, proposes a new machine learning model to improve the performance of IDSs by using Random Forest and a posterior detection based on coresets to improve the detection accuracy and increase detection efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed machine learning model can significantly enhance the detection accuracy compared to classical application of machine learning models.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-021-01001-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

How human values are embodied and actualised in situ may ultimately prove to be harmful if not outright recalcitrant. For this reason, the values of stakeholders become of particular significance given the risks posed by opaque structures of intelligent agents. This paper explores how decision matrix algorithms, via the belief-desire-intention model for autonomous vehicles, can be designed to minimize the risks of opaque architectures. Primarily through an explicit orientation towards designing for the values of explainability and verifiability. In doing so, this research adopts the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach as a principled framework for the incorporation of such values within design. VSD is recognized as a potential starting point that offers a systematic way for engineering teams to formally incorporate existing technical solutions within ethical design, while simultaneously remaining pliable to emerging issues and needs. It is concluded that the VSD methodology offers at least a strong enough foundation from which designers can begin to anticipate design needs and formulate salient design flows that can be adapted to the changing ethical landscapes required for utilisation in autonomous vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00790-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The interaction effect of brand personality and service provision type on brand attitudes and purchase intentions,Journal of Brand Management,10.1057/s41262-021-00261-7,Springer,3/1/2022,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced, it has become crucial to promoting service innovation and evolution. However, whether and when consumers prefer AI-enabled services remains unclear. This study addresses this question by investigating the matching effect of brand personality (sincerity vs. competence) and customer service provision type (human-staffed vs. AI-enabled) on brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Three scenario-based online experiments revealed that consumers prefer AI-enabled customer service when the brand personality is competence and human-staffed service when the brand personality is sincerity. These preferences lead to more positive brand attitudes and higher purchase intentions. We also found that perceived brand authenticity mediates the above relationships. Meanwhile, our investigation of the moderating role of consumer involvement found that the brand personality-service provision alignment’s positive effects emerge for high-involvement consumers but not for low-involvement consumers. These findings contribute to brand personality and authenticity theory and have practical implications for companies’ marketing strategies—elucidating, for example, how the effects of utilizing AI-enabled customer service may influence brand attitudes and purchase intentions regarding brands with different “personalities.”",http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41262-021-00261-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

At the same time, a conventional data storage and management layer is not optimized to derive timely insights and value from huge volumes of data. This problem is rooted in a classical cross-layer dilemma wherein neither the application nor the storage layer has the deep knowledge needed to optimize the whole system. We resolve this omniscience dilemma by introducing ProSPECT, a set of techniques to proactively optimize analytics computations and data storage. ProSPECT enables a data fabric to become aware of the purpose and relevance of stored data by intercepting the lineage of workflows under execution within existing analytics frameworks. Partial analytics computations can then be initiated proactively by the data fabric layer, where data is stored and managed. ProSPECT provides analytics applications with relevant data or precomputed insights and alleviates storage management challenges using proactive tiering and data approximation. We describe experiments with application case studies using Apache Spark and Alluxio to demonstrate an order of magnitude reduction in the storage space occupied in the fastest tier and in time to value for analytics applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41403-021-00261-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we explore textual descriptions of more than 250 thousand startups in the Crunchbase database. We analyze the 2009–2019 period by using topic modeling. We propose a novel classification of startup companies free from expert bias that contains 38 topics and quantifies the weight of each of these topics for all the startups. Taking the year of establishment and geographical location of the startups into account, we measure which topics were increasing or decreasing their share over time, and which of them were predominantly present in Europe, North America, or other regions. We find that the share of startups focused on data analytics, social platforms, and financial transfers, and time management has risen, while an opposite trend is observed for mobile gaming, online news, and online social networks as well as legal and professional services. We also identify strong regional differences in topic distribution, suggesting certain concentration of the startups. For example, sustainable agriculture is presented stronger in South America and Africa, while pharmaceutics, in North America and Europe. Furthermore, we explore which pairs of topics tend to co-occur more often together, quantify how multisectoral the startups are, and which startup classes attract more investments. Finally, we compare our classification to the one existing in the Crunchbase database, demonstrating how we improve it. We propose a novel classification of more than 250 thousand startups registered in the Crunchbase database based on machine learning algorithms and free from expert bias.

By utilizing the sole numerical analysis method for a complicated distributed resource planning problem, the satisfactory optimal solution is impossible to obtain.

But with this comes an extensive risk of unauthorized access. Hence, for the security and privacy of the data, intrusion detection system (IDS) is required. IDS has to process a huge number of data with dimensions in search of intrusions. The more data it has to scan through, the more time it takes to detect an intrusion. Thus to reduce the dataset, feature selection (FS) is used where redundant data dimensions are discarded. In this paper, authors have proposed a novel Sage Grouse Mating algorithm which is to be implemented for FS in IDS. The proposed model was tested on NSL-KDD and Kyoto2006+ datasets. The proposed model increases the average accuracy of IDS up to 81.729% and reduces the number of features from 41 to 14 on NSL-KDD dataset.

In autonomous vehicles, the driving scene (target domain) consists of unconstrained road environments which cannot all possibly be observed in training data (source domain) and this will lead to a sharp drop in the accuracy of the detector. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework based on pseudo-labels to solve the domain shift. First, the pseudo-labels of the target domain images are generated by the baseline detector (BD) and optimized by our data optimization module to correct the errors. Then, the hard samples in a single image are labeled based on the optimization results of pseudo-labels. The adaptive sampling module is approached to sample target domain data according to the number of hard samples per image to select more effective data. Finally, a modified knowledge distillation loss is applied in the retraining module, and we investigate two ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain to retrain the detector. We evaluate the average precision of our approach in various source/target domain pairs and demonstrate that the framework improves over 10% average precision of BD on multiple domain adaptation scenarios on the Cityscapes, KITTI, and Apollo datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06609-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, this scheme requires an inquiry-answer process, which quadratically increases the computational load as the number of agents increases. To enhance the scalability of TL for MARL when all the agents learn from scratch, we propose an experience sharing based memetic TL for MARL, called MeTL-ES. In the MeTL-ES, the agents actively share implicit memetic knowledge (experience), which avoids the inquiry-answer process and brings highly scalable and effective acceleration of learning. In particular, we firstly design an experience sharing scheme to share implicit meme based experience among the agents. Within this scheme, experience from the peers is collected and used to speed up the learning process. More importantly, this scheme frees the agents from actively asking for the states and policies of other agents, which enhances scalability. Secondly, an event-triggered scheme is designed to enable the agents to share the experiences at appropriate timings. Simulation studies show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed MeTL-ES can more effectively enhance the learning speed of learning-from-scratch MARL systems. At the same time, we show that the communication cost and computational load of MeTL-ES increase linearly with the growth of the number of agents, indicating better scalability compared to the popular action advising based methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12293-021-00339-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

According to the digital transformation trends, Internet of Things (IoT) represents an interested research issue. As the IoT grows, the data and the processes will need more space. The data in cases like healthcare, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart agriculture, etc. needs to be analyzed and processed in real-time. Cisco refers to the dependence of edge and cloud as “The Fog”. The data can be analyzed at the fog layer to maximize data utilization. This paper presents a new Effective Prediction and Resource Allocation Methodology (EPRAM) for Fog environment, which is suitable for Healthcare applications. Resource Allocation (RA) represents a hard mission as it involves a set of various resources and fog nodes to achieve the required computations for IoT systems. EPRAM tries to achieve effective resource management in Fog environment via real-time resource allocating as well as prediction algorithm. EPRAM is composed of three main modules, namely: (i) Data Preprocessing Module (DPM), (ii) Resource Allocation Module (RAM) and (ii) Effective Prediction Module (EPM). The EPM uses the PNN to predict a target field, using one or more predictors. In order to detect the probability of the heart attack, PNN is trained using the training dataset. Then PNN will be tested using the user’s sensing data coming from the IoT layer to predict the probability of heart attack and then take the most appropriate action accordingly. The main goal of the system is to achieve a low latency while improving the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as (the allocation cost, the response time, bandwidth efficiency and energy consumption). Unlike other RA techniques, EPRAM employs deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in a new manner. It also uses the PNN for the prediction algorithm. It has achieved such acceptable performance due to using deep RL and PNN. Deep RL has shown impressive promises in resource allocation. PNN generates accurate predicted target and is much faster than multilayer perceptron networks. Comparing the EPRAM with the state-of-the-art algorithms, EPRAM achieved the minimum Makespan as compared to previous LB algorithms, while maximizing the Average Resource Utilization (ARU) and the Load Balancing Level (LBL). Accordingly, EPRAM is a suitable algorithm in the case of real-time systems in FC which leads to load balancing. ERAM is effective in monitoring and predicting the status of the patient accurately and quickly.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12223-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Lane detection algorithm is crucial aspect in making intelligent driving systems that can be used in autonomous self-driving vehicles, road safety, and accidents prevention systems, testing and analyzing driving skills, etc. Lane detection systems using hand crafted features fails in complex scenarios like adverse weather condition, low illumination, sharp turns and occlusion. Recently, deep learning models have been used remarkable in driving assistance systems and shows a significant improvement in their performance. Although, deep learning based methods has shown significant success in lane detection using hybrid techniques, that includes FCN, CNN and RNN.

This way the filtering is based on both, the external information (RSSI) and the internal information (IMU). To process the IMU data, we use machine learning activity recognition models (we apply feature selection and compare three models and choose the best one—Gradient Boosted Decision Trees).

Considered as a promising way to handle the ever-growing complexity of software systems, they have seen an increasing level of interest and are covering a variety of applications, e.g., autonomous car systems and adaptive network systems. Many approaches for the construction of self-adaptive systems have been developed, and probabilistic models, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs), are one of the favoured. However, the majority of them do not deal with the problems of the underlying MDP being obsolete under new environments or unsatisfactory to the given properties. This results in the generated policies from such MDP failing to guide the self-adaptive system to run correctly and meet goals. In this article, we propose a systematic approach to updating an obsolete MDP by exploring new states and transitions and removing obsolete ones, and repairing an unsatisfactory MDP by adjusting its structure in a more meaningful way rather than arbitrarily changing the transition probabilities to values not in line with reality. Experimental results show that the MDPs updated and repaired by our approach are more competent in guiding the self-adaptive systems’ correct running compared with the original ones.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11390-021-1484-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An ethical controller is proposed to be embedded into these autonomous systems, to enable their successful integration in the society and its norms. This proposed controller that integrates machine ethics is realized through three main strategies that utilize two ethical paradigms, namely deontology, and consequentialism. These strategies are triggered according to the type of event sensed and the state of the autonomous industrial cyber-physical human systems, their combination being potentially unknown or posing ethical dilemmas. Two case studies are investigated, that deal with a fire emergency, and two different contexts i.e. one with an autonomous train, and one with an autonomous industrial plant, are discussed to illustrate the controller utilization. The case studies demonstrate the potential benefits and exemplify the need to integrate ethical behaviors in autonomous industrial cyber-physical human systems already at the design phase. The proposed approach, use cases, and discussions make evident the need to address ethical aspects in new efforts to engineer industrial systems in the context of Industry 4.0.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10111-020-00657-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Instead of using an image-based sensing approach, we propose a simple learning system that uses only a few sparse range data from a distance sensor to train a learning agent. We based our approaches on two state-of-art double critics Deep-RL models: Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We show that our two approaches manage to outperform an approach based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique and the BUG2 algorithm. Also, our new Deep-RL structure based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) outperforms the current structure used to perform mapless navigation of mobile robots.

Existing ML defense techniques have several limitations in practical use. We proposed a trustworthy framework that employs an adaptive strategy to inspect both inputs and decisions. In particular, data streams are examined by a series of diverse filters before sending to the learning system and then crossed checked its output through anomaly (outlier) detectors before making the final decision. Experimental results (using benchmark data-sets) demonstrated that our dual-filtering strategy could mitigate adaptive or advanced adversarial manipulations for wide-range of ML attacks with higher accuracy. Moreover, the output decision boundary inspection with a classification technique automatically affirms the reliability and increases the trustworthiness of any ML-based decision support system.

Using a scientometrics analysis of the publication records (between 1991 and 2020; n  = 1028), and content analysis of highly cited publications, our study provided insights on the ELSE implications of AI. Our study findings indicate that ELSE implications of AI development started gaining momentum globally over the last 5 years and we predict that by the end of this decade publication numbers will be more than 750 per year. Europe (46%) and North America (33%) were leaders in publications in this area while Africa (1.8%) and South America (1.4%) have lagged behind. Additionally, the computer science (350) research area had the maximum number of ELSE implications of AI publications, followed by humanities and social sciences (e.g., legal, policy; 322), but have not been explored extensively in the agricultural sciences (23). We observed that the major disparities in studies of ELSE implications of AI were found to be a combination of economics, governance, sociocultural, and policy factors.

Each member of the collective of autonomous vehicles tries to adapt to the changing environment, therefore together they execute decentralised autonomous adaptation by exploiting real-time information about their environment. The routing of these vehicles needs proper computer science models to be able to develop the best information technology for their control. We review different traffic flow models in computer science, and we evaluate their usefulness and applicability to autonomous vehicles. The classical game theory model implies flow level decision making in route selection. Non-cooperative autonomous vehicles may produce unwanted traffic patterns. Improved decentralised autonomous adaptation techniques try to establish some kind of coordination among autonomous vehicles, mainly through intention awareness. The aggregation of the intentions of autonomous vehicles may help to predict future traffic situations. The novel intention-aware online routing game model points out that intention-awareness helps to avoid that the traffic generated by autonomous vehicles be worse than the traffic indicated by classical traffic flow models. The review helps to make the first steps towards research on global level control of autonomous vehicles by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different formal models.

Focusing on the main system, real-time retrieval of outputs based on mutual interactions of the whole autonomous entities makes the agent-based simulation very promising. This paper deals with an agent-based simulation to investigate and evaluate the potential impacts of implementing Shared Public Transports (SPT) in urban areas. Such a system is intended to integrate the two flows of passengers and containerized freights in Public Transportation (PT) patterns towards more sustainable, efficient, and socially suitable mobility. The proposed model is coupled with a stochastic process in order to provide a range of real-world data of Casablanca city (Morocco) based on institutional surveys. In this respect, two urban transportation systems of freight are tested: (1) the conventional transportation system, (2) the SPT system with heterogeneous fleets. In an effort to sustain efficient and safe movements, this paper examines SPT performances according to a set of key evaluation metrics. Results show that PT stopping remains the most relevant factor when evaluating metrics of the number of waiting containers and waiting time of demand by rates of 82.440% and 62.580%, respectively. Such a waiting containers metric is significantly affected by the volume of demand to transport per time slot by a rate of 78.140%. Under SPT, traffic congestion is the main factor to consider in managing PT with a rate of 65.690% in order to reduce potential accidents. However, demand volume could increase the on-street illegal parking metric by 90.070%.

These shortcomings are diverse and range from a lack of generalization over insufficient interpretability and implausible predictions to directed attacks by means of malicious inputs. Cyber-physical systems employing DNNs are therefore likely to suffer from so-called safety concerns, properties that preclude their deployment as no argument or experimental setup can help to assess the remaining risk. In recent years, an abundance of state-of-the-art techniques aiming to address these safety concerns has emerged. This chapter provides a structured and broad overview of them.

However, in OECD-Europe, transportation still represents the biggest source of carbon emissions, contributing by about 25% to the total CO 2 emissions, with cars and vans representing more than two-thirds of this share. The situation is even more alarming in non-OECD countries, where the transportation energy demand is expected to rise by 64% until 2040. The shift that we are witnessing toward the adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is going to be perhaps the most disruptive since the early days of automobiles and could revolutionize movement of people and goods. This level of connectivity and autonomy will transform transportation in several dimensions with important societal and economic impacts: improved safety, increased comfort, time saving potential, and more efficient road utilization are among the most widely discussed positive impacts of CAVs. However, the potential energy efficiency benefits of these technologies remain uncertain. From a single-vehicle efficiency perspective, research suggests that lightweight, low-speed, autonomous vehicles have the potential to achieve fuel economy an order of magnitude higher than current cars. Yet, at system-wide level, current estimates suggest that the total energy consumption impacts can range from a 90% decrease to a 200% increase in fuel consumption as compared to a projected 2050 baseline energy consumption. The paradigm that traffic congestion mitigation should reduce CO 2 emissions is yet to be proved. Therefore, interest in transportation regulation problems with explicit environmental considerations is growing. This work takes a more in-depth look at increased opportunities for energy-efficient driving with energy-oriented traffic management and CAVs deployment. In particular, the focus will be put on the road traffic control strategies in urban networks using connectivity to enable variable speed limits and traffic light adaptive control, as well as the energy-saving opportunities that arise for individual CAVs by anticipating future road geometry, traffic conditions, and interactions with neighboring vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-72579-2_128,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Depending on this issue, the scenarios research that can ensure safety and are related to vehicle safety assessments are essential. In this paper, based on ‘report of traffic collision involving an AVs’ provided by California DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles), we extract the major factors for identifying AVs traffic accidents to derive basic AVs traffic accident scenarios by employing the random forest, one of the machine learning. As a result, we have found the importance of the pre-collision movement of neighboring vehicles to AVs and inferred that they are related to collision time (TTC). Based on these factors, we derived scenarios and confirm that AVs rear-end collisions of neighboring vehicles usually occur when AVs are ahead in passing, changing lanes, and merge situations. While most accident determinants and scenarios are expected to be similar to those between human driving vehicles (HVs), AVs are expected to reduce accident rates because ‘AVs do not cause accidents.’",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-9416-5_1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this project, the navigation aid is a front-facing camera mounted and images from the camera are used to compute steering commands. This work made use of two methods which are the handcrafted method for lane navigation and the end to end learning scheme developed by Nvidia cooperation to train a model to compute steering command from a front-facing camera. The deep learning model is compared with the handcraft method of computing steering angle. The difference between these two methods is presented in this work as the navigation of a modelled car which navigates through the designed lanes using both methods, the accuracy of the car following the lanes is used to determine the better method for lane navigation.

Technological integration and digital transformation are of focus in the strategy to recover and reconstruct civic society post-pandemic across the globe, especially in the domains of healthcare, education, surveillance, and governance. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen to benefit society through building and assisting critical socio-technical systems. Automated decision-making through algorithms is debated widely for its limitations in tackling biases and inability to discourage unintended. Moreover, AI learns patterns from the data, which by nature is biased due to existing socio-economic complexities. The pervasive application of AI when implemented and integrated with social systems is observed to pose socio-ethical challenges such as institutionalization of discrimination, biased decision-making, intrusiveness, low accountability, and mistrust. Various threats and vulnerabilities imposed to human community-like natural disasters, health pandemics, and economic uncertainties necessitate inevitable adoption of AI applications that can mitigate socio-ethical challenges and adhere to human security principles. Current data protection laws seem to be insufficient to protect human rights in the given scenarios. Literature advocates for transparency, explainability, and auditability of AI models. However, it may not necessarily lead to accountability and fairness. Embedding these socio-technical systems in the broader institutional frameworks of regulation and governance can balance the risks without compromising on the benefits of technological innovations. The socio-economic context in which AI model is deployed necessitates the responses to be local and context specific. This also necessitates AI governance framework to be comprehensive, prevention-oriented, while protecting and empowering human value and dignity. This chapter provides commentary on the social, ethical, and technical issues that AI can impose along with various aspects that need to be considered while governing AI. Finally, an AI governance framework is proposed based on socio-administrative principles to extend their credibility in mitigating, managing and governing the human threats and uphold human security.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-5074-1_22,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As indicated by Gartner’s recent study, there are around 25 billion devices and a gadget interfacing with IoT including wearables and automated vehicles to smart homes and smart cities applications. All such connected (smart) devices generate immense data that needs to be examined and analysed, to ensure that they continually learn from the available datasets and better themselves without any manual interference. This is where the prerequisite for machine learning comes into being. Several ML algorithms and techniques are introduced in a short time to easily evaluate big data measurements, increasing the IoT’s productivity. Similarly, special ML techniques, such as decision trees, clustering and neural and Bayesian networks, allow devices and gadgets to discern trends from various sources in different kinds of datasets and take appropriate decisions based on their analysis. It would really be difficult for smart devices to make smart decisions gradually without including and enforcing ML. The IoT helps to interconnect various hardware devices, such as houses, cars, electronic gadgets and other devices that are integrated with actuators, sensors and software, so that data can be collected and shared. As various organizations understand the progressive capability of the IoT, they have begun finding various obstructions they have to deliver to use it productively. Numerous organizations and businesses use ML to exploit the IoT’s latent capacity. This chapter evaluates the different methods of machine learning that deal with the challenges posed in the handling of IoT data. Note that this big data is generated through the communication of Internet of Things/smart devices, and this data stored at cloud.

On the other hand, cognitive computing refers to systems that emulate cognitive processes inspired by human thinking processes for solving problems. The Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) technology refers to a combination of cognitive systems and IoT. A benefit of this technology is that the management problems of the IoT will be solved by solutions that come from cognitive systems domain. In recent years, CIoT has received much attention. This is because the management algorithms of the IoT are very complex and therefore human thinking processes as computerized cognitive processes are required for fast and accurate decision-making. Existing algorithms reported as management mechanisms for CIoT only focus on utilizing artificial intelligence without considering fundamental issues of cognitive systems such as predictability, controllability, responsibility, safety, security, and energy consumption. Ignoring these issues may result in designing inappropriate cognitive systems that may be faced with a wide range of problems such as hacking and failure. CIoT inherited numerous challenges from artificial intelligence, IoT, and cognitive systems. Therefore, the challenges of these fields should be studied to extract the challenges in designing CIoT. In the literature, there is no study on extracting the challenges considering associated technologies to CIoT. In this paper, the challenges of the associated technologies are summarized.

It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition from any of the parameters will lead the plant to stress and deteriorate, potentially leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious ways of monitoring the agricultural parameters are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated irrigation system is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive watering of crops and crop water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect the growth of plants. Supplying an optimum amount of water is essential for the healthy development of plants.

This is achieved by mimicking the human driving behaviour in the training mode on a track. A dataset is generated by the simulator based on the human driving behaviour in the training mode and a deep learning model is built using this dataset which is then used to drive the car autonomously on any unseen track. Initially the model performed well only on the already seen track and failed to perform well on new unseen tracks. The simulator track in which the car was trained with didn’t consist of any sharp turns or elevations or any other road barriers, but the real world tracks do contain them, so in order to overcome this problem image processing techniques like zooming, changing brightness, flipping images, panning were used and in order to avoid over-fitting problem more dataset was generated using data augmentation techniques. Finally a model was built which was able to generalise the tracks and drive the car autonomously on the unseen track of the simulator.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-11633-9_23,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For centuries this quest has included the aspiration of creating artificial intelligent assistants, either embodied in physical objects or existing as mere software elements whose achievements have both advanced and challenged our perception of the notion of intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are no longer distant, detached research efforts but have become part of our everyday objects and experiences which are contributing to shape our professional, social and personal environments cultivating the technology enabled collective intelligence. Through this chapter we aim to explore the structure of technologies and product categories that constitute the ever dynamic and thriving AI landscape and their impacts in technician engagement through enhanced collaborative competencies. Specifically, AI technologies contributed to shape trends related with NDE competencies such as: 1. An unsatisfied demand of highly specialized NDE technicians in specific niches that runs parallel with the irruption and democratization of NDE technologies contained in direct-to-consumer products. 2. An increased bi-directional permeability of NDE and Digital competencies in the workplace. 3. Aging workforces decline amidst increased inspection demand aging-out of skilled craft and challenge in backfilling with current generational mindsets. As we will explore in Chap. 9, NDE 4.0 will imply a profound re-orientation of training and certification efforts not only for NDE professionals but also for AI assistants with increasingly capable NDE competencies. It will also shape normalization efforts to guide an ordered and natural assimilation of those technologies. Additionally, we aim to provide valuable connections to supplementary resources that may contribute from NDE professionals around the world to the use of AI technologies to expand their pursuits for professional and personal development with increased confidence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73206-6_24,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Despite this considerable effort, there is a lack of a systematic and fair analysis of the input representations by means of a careful experimental evaluation on the same framework. To this aim, this work proposes the first comprehensive, comparative analysis of the most common inputs that can be processed by a conditional imitation learning (CIL) approach. With more details, we considered the combinations of raw and processed data—namely RGB images, depth (D) images and semantic segmentation (S)—to be assessed as inputs of the well-established Conditional Imitation Learning with ResNet and Speed prediction (CILRS) architecture. We performed a benchmark analysis, endorsed by statistical tests, on the CARLA simulator to compare the considered configurations. The achieved results showed that RGB outperformed the other monomodal inputs, in terms of success rate on the most popular benchmark NoCrash. However, RGB did not generalize well when tested on different weather conditions; overall, the best multimodal configuration was a combination of the RGB image and semantic segmentation inputs (i.e., RGBS) compared to the others, especially in regular and dense traffic scenarios.

In Study 1, we found perceived injustice was the primary determinant of uncanniness and uncanniness had a negative effect on trust. Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings using two different scenarios of wrongful acts involving an artificial agent.

However, one of the significant issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the rapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be uninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to understand the decision and bias to control and trust systems’ unexpected or seemingly unpredictable outputs. It is acknowledged that the loss of control over interpretability of decision-making becomes a critical issue for many data-driven automated applications.

As a result, edge clouds for many applications (e.g. agriculture, ecology, and smart city deployments) must operate in remote, unattended, and environmentally harsh settings, introducing new challenges. One key challenge is heat exposure, which can degrade the performance, reliability, and longevity of electronics. For edge clouds, these problems are exacerbated because they increasingly perform complex workloads, such as machine learning, to affect data-driven actuation and control of devices and systems in the environment. The goal of our work is to protect edge clouds from overheating. To enable this, we develop a heat-budget-based scheduling system, called Sparta, which leverages dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to adaptively control CPU temperature. Sparta takes machine learning applications, datasets, and a temperature threshold as input. It sets the initial frequency of the CPU based on historical data and then dynamically updates it, according to the applications’ execution profile and ambient temperature, to safeguard edge devices.

Starting with the rights-enabling framework of the GDPR, we proceed to uncover technical and protective forms of explanations owed under contract, tort and banking law. Moreover, we discuss what the recent EU proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act means for explainable AI, and review the proposal’s strengths and limitations in this respect.

Such multiple-objective optimizations include robot travelling distance minimization, time minimization, turning minimization, etc. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm incorporated with a Generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) method is proposed for a robot to reach multiple waypoints with minimized total distance. Firstly, a GVD is used to form a Voronoi diagram in an obstacle populated environment to construct safety-conscious routes. Secondly, the sequence of multiple waypoints is created by the PSO algorithm to minimize the total travel cost. Thirdly, while the robot attempts to visit multiple waypoints, it traverses along the edges of the GVD to form a collision-free trajectory. The regional path locally from waypoints to nearest nodes or edges needs to be created to join the trajectory. A Node Selection Algorithm (NSA) is developed in this paper to implement such a protocol to build up regional path from waypoints to nearest nodes or edges on GVD. Finally, a histogram-based local reactive navigator is adopted for moving obstacle avoidance. Simulation and comparison studies validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09726-3_7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The book deals with the intersection of law and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Law and AI interact in two different ways, which are both covered in this book: law can regulate AI and AI can be applied in legal practice Legal practice . AI is a new generation of technologies, mainly characterized by being self-learning Self-learning technologies and autonomous. This means that AI technologies can continuously improve without (much) human intervention and can make decisions that are not pre-programmed. Artificial Intelligence can mimic human intelligence Human intelligence , but not necessarily so. Similarly, when AI is implemented in physical technologies, such as robots Robots , it can mimic human beings (e.g., socially assistive robots Robots acting like nurses), but it can also look completely different if it has a more functional shape (e.g., like an industrial arm that picks boxes in a factory). AI without a physical component can sometimes be hardly visible to end users, but evident to those that created and manage the system. In all its different shapes and sizes, AI is rapidly and radically changing the world around us, which may call for regulation in different areas of law. Relevant areas in public law Public law include non-discrimination law Non-discrimination law , labour law Labour law , humanitarian law Humanitarian law , constitutional law Constitutional law , immigration law Immigration law , criminal law Criminal law and tax law Tax law . Relevant areas in private law Private law include liability law, intellectual property law, corporate law, competition law Competition law and consumer law Consumer law . At the same time, AI can be applied in legal practice Legal practice . In this book, the focus is mostly on legal technologies, such as the use of AI in legal teams, law-making, and legal scholarship. This introductory chapter concludes with an overview of the structure of this book, containing introductory chapters on what AI is, chapters on how AI is (or could be) regulated in different areas of both public and private law Private law , chapters on applying AI in legal practice Legal practice , and chapters on the future of AI and what these developments may entail from a legal perspective.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-6265-523-2_1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the importance of interpretable and explainable decision-making processes within AI-based systems is becoming crucial to provide transparency and confidence among end-users from diverse backgrounds. Acceptance of these black-box models considerably depends on to which extent the users or technical personnel understand and trust the underlying mechanism. However, ML methods and models are getting more sophisticated and transparent progressively. Though the domain experts understand the mathematical principle, they still face difficulties expressing the mechanism for a wide audience. To address this issue, a recent research domain—Explainable AI (XAI), has emerged intending to generate the contextual explanatory model for practical deployment. In this chapter, we systematically review and examine the existing literature and contribution of XAI in different domains. The presented taxonomy contains our investigation on the necessity of explaining and contextualizing methods and models in the AI ecosystem.

In recent years, modern transportation networks have undergone a rapid transformation. This has resulted in a variety of automotive technology advances, including connected vehicles, hybrid vehicles, Hyperloop, self-driving cars and even flying cars, as well as major improvements in global transportation networks. Because of the open existence of smart transportation system as a wireless networking technology, it poses a number of security and privacy challenges. Information and communication technology has long aided transportation productivity and safety in advanced economies. These implementations, on the other hand, have tended to be high-cost, customized infrastructure systems. To address these challenges, a novel machine learning method developed for a transportation system is reused for making it more generic and smart for intelligent carriage. This type of transfer learning enables rapid progress on the task with enhanced results.

This paper proposes a novel 3D object classifier that can exploit data from a LIDAR, a RADAR, and a monocular camera image after orthogonal projection. To achieve this, a learnable architecture is designed end-to-end, which fuses the detection results from multiple sensor modalities initially and exploits continuous convolution subsequently to achieve the desired levels of accuracy. An adaptive algorithm for prediction in real-time is used to automatically increase weightage to prediction results from a particular sensor modality which aids in keeping accuracy invariant to scene changes. To prevent the bias, we are using a training strategy which provides attention to the specific type of sensor. This strategy is inspired by dropout.

Deep learning is essentially predicated on the notion that, with a sufficiently large training set, the statistical correlations captured by training will actually be causal [310]. However, in the absence of convergence theorems to support this, it remains a hypothesis. Indeed, insofar as there is evidence, it increasingly indicates to the contrary, since the application of enormous volumes of computational effort has still failed to deliver models with the generalization capability of an infant. There is accordingly increasing discussion about what further conceptual or practical insights might be required [57]. At the time of writing, the very definition of deep learning is in flux, with one Turing Award laureate defining it as “a way to try to make machines intelligent by allowing computers to learn from examples” and another as “differentiable programming”. We argue in the following that deep learning is highly unlikely to yield intelligence, at the very least while it equates intelligence with “solving a regression problem”.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08020-3_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to its generality and robustness, RL is applied in several disciplines such as game theory, control theory, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, robotics, and NLP. Despite these advances and successes, reinforcement learning faces many challenges for real-world adoption. Some of the major difficulties being, operator’s trust and ability of an agent to explain the actions taken in a human-understandable manner. Traditionally the AI systems are black-box models. With the advent of various legal regulations worldwide, notably the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [ 29 ], it has started becoming mandatory that the AI models be transparent, interpretable, and secure. If an RL agent can effectively and accurately explain the actions carried out by the RL system to the observers/operators, it will be a tangible step towards developing the ART (accountable, reliable and trustworthy) RL agent. This can effectively facilitate the adoption of RL systems in real-world domains. Various explainable AI (XAI) methods have been reported in the literature. However, there is a considerable lacuna in the availability of Explainable RL (XRL) methods. This paper introduces a novel RL algorithm agnostic approach of generating human-understandable explanations using the probabilistic graphical model. This method is based on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) [ 36 ]. It is algorithm agnostic in that it is not dependent on any specific RL method and can be integrated with any RL algorithm. We also introduce a PGM model, which is learned along with an agent’s training via classic methods and used for generating explanations at run time. Specific case studies are considered, and results are presented which demonstrate our approach. Our experiments show that the PGM-based approach is highly intuitive and a definitive step towards generating the human understandable explanations. It is a promising approach for discrete as well as continuous real-world systems employing RL.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95502-1_28,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Implementing such model can, however, become challenging, as the access policies have to be updated dynamically in the context of constantly changing network environment. In this research project, we are aiming to implement a prototype of intelligent defense framework relying on advanced technologies that have recently emerged in the area of software-defined networking and network function virtualization.

Such increases in memory and computational demands make deep learning prohibitive for resource-constrained hardware platforms such as mobile devices. Recent efforts aim to reduce these overheads, while preserving model performance as much as possible, and include parameter reduction techniques, parameter quantization, and lossless compression techniques. In this chapter, we develop and describe a novel quantization paradigm for DNNs: Our method leverages concepts of explainable AI (XAI) and concepts of information theory: Instead of assigning weight values based on their distances to the quantization clusters, the assignment function additionally considers weight relevances obtained from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and the information content of the clusters (entropy optimization). The ultimate goal is to preserve the most relevant weights in quantization clusters of highest information content. Experimental results show that this novel Entropy-Constrained and XAI-adjusted Quantization (ECQ $$^{\text {x}}$$ x ) method generates ultra low-precision (2–5 bit) and simultaneously sparse neural networks while maintaining or even improving model performance. Due to reduced parameter precision and high number of zero-elements, the rendered networks are highly compressible in terms of file size, up to 103 $$\times $$ × compared to the full-precision unquantized DNN model.

We first introduce an attack vector that derives from the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model itself. DNN models are trained from gigantic data that may be poisoned by attackers. Different from the traditional poisoning attacks that interfere with the decision boundary, backdoor attacks create a “shortcut” in the model’s decision boundary. Such a “shortcut” can only be activated by a trigger known by the attacker itself, while it performs well on benign inputs without the trigger. We then show several mitigation techniques from the frontend to the backend of the machine learning pipeline. We finally provide avenues for future research. We hope to raise awareness about the severity of the current emerging backdoor attacks in DNNs and attempt to provide a timely solution to fight against them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98795-4_13,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Typically, it is intractable to test an autonomous system for every scenario in its operating environment. The question of whether it is possible to design a single test for multiple requirements of the system motivates this work. First, we formally define three attributes of a test: a test specification that characterizes behaviors observed in a test execution, a test environment, and a test policy. Using the merge operator from contract-based design theory, we provide a formalism to construct a merged test specification from two unit test specifications. Temporal constraints on the merged test specification guarantee that non-trivial satisfaction of both unit test specifications is necessary for a successful merged test execution. We assume that the test environment remains the same across the unit tests and the merged test. Given a test specification and a test environment, we synthesize a test policy filter using a receding horizon approach, and use the test policy filter to guide a search procedure (e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree Search) to find a test policy that is guaranteed to satisfy the test specification. This search procedure finds a test policy that maximizes a pre-defined robustness metric for the test while the filter guarantees a test policy for satisfying the test specification. We prove that our algorithm is sound. Furthermore, the receding horizon approach to synthesizing the filter ensures that our algorithm is scalable. Finally, we show that merging unit tests is impactful for designing efficient test campaigns to achieve similar levels of coverage in fewer test executions. We illustrate our framework on two self-driving examples in a discrete-state setting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06773-0_7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Similarly, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is getting more popular with all the revolutions made in the technologies. Sensor Network Technology is used in industrial applications, smart homes and system. A massive amount of data can be obtained from these sensors which are linked to the human body. Recognition of Human Activities using these sensors, and wearable technologies has been actively studied. Behavior Recognition seeks to distinguish one or more people’s activities and goals through a collection of observations on the actions and environmental conditions of the person. Health surveillance, aged treatment, and plenty of other domains can be used to automatically understand the behavioral context. An existing dataset consisting of 10 subjects (5 females, 5 males) is being used in the paper, which incorporates both young and old volunteers between 19 and 60 years of old with weights ranging from 55 to 85 kg. The dataset reflects motion data collected when subjects are engaged in 11 separate (static and dynamic) smart home activities: computer usage (1 min), telephone conversation (1 min), vacuum cleaning (1 min), book reading (1 min), TV watching (1 min), ironing (1 min), walking (1 min), exercise (1 min), cooking (1 min), drinking (20 times), hair brushing (1 min) (20 times). Most of the activities are similar because of the multi sensor environment which makes it more difficult. Using three tri axial IMU (inertial measurement unit), Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Gyroscope sensors attached to the subject area of the hand, chest, and thigh, using Machine Learning we introduced a better model to prognosticate the human activity. We have applied various machine learning classification algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Ensemble Extra Trees Classifier, Label Propagation and Label Spreading.

Despite its immense potential, deep learning models face significant challenges, such as the need for a large dataset for training in the real world.

The digitalization of services has resulted in a compelling, major change in the sector, which is now referred to as Industry 4.0. One of the major changes embracing this industrial revolution is the development of robotics. Today, with the tasks becoming increasingly complex, robots are more trusted to perform the tasks with accuracy. They are rapidly substituting human skills in terms of speed, accuracy, and replaceability. Over the years, they have made vital contributions to some of the major industries, like 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, computer chip building, health and safety, agriculture, and so on. Robotics is a key Industry 4.0 technology that gives significant possibilities in the realm of production. However, with the introduction of Industry 4.0, it has become increasingly impossible for a corporation to remain relevant without incorporating some type of intelligent technology. Big data, which is generated by a wide range of sensors, necessitates complicated systems capable of distilling usable information and making intelligent judgments. This is where technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning may help. The major result of combining these technologies with modern robotics is the creation of intelligent factories that are very powerful, safe, and cost-effective. The current research discussed the function of deep learning in robots for bolstering Industry 4.0. The authors discussed the various ways in which deep learning algorithms may be employed to improve the performance of robotics systems.

Compared to the existing works, we introduced per car unit (PCU) as a novel input to represent the effect of each vehicle type on traffic conditions. Extensive tests on real-time data amply prove that the proposed scheme enhances the average speed of traffic up to 5.597 km/h. The proposed scheme shows an average increment of 175.71% in average mean speed compared to the existing static schemes. Except for the high traffic scenario, for both mid-traffic and low-traffic scenarios, the proposed scheme shows a considerable improvement in both average densities and maximum densities. In the mid-traffic scenario, the average speed shows an improvement of 3.85 km/h, while in the low-traffic scenario, the average mean speed shows an improvement of 7.96 km/h.

Their operations require reliable networking environments and location-based services in air-to-air links with co-operative drones, or air-to-ground links in concert with ground control stations. When equipped with high-resolution video cameras or sensors to gain environmental situation awareness through object detection/tracking, precise location predictions of individual or groups of drones at any instant possible is critical for continuous guidance. The location predictions then can be used in trajectory optimization for achieving efficient operations (i.e., through effective resource utilization in terms of energy or network bandwidth consumption) and safe operations (i.e., through avoidance of obstacles or sudden landing) within application missions.

These techniques facilitate the drones to follow intelligent paths and establish optimal trajectories while carrying out successful application missions under given resource and network constraints. We detail the techniques using three scenarios. The first scenario involves location prediction based intelligent packet transfer between drones in a disaster response scenario using the various Kalman Filtering techniques along with sensor fusion. The second scenario involves a learning-based trajectory optimization that uses various reinforcement learning models for maintaining high video resolution and effective network performance in a civil application scenario such as aerial monitoring of persons/objects. The third scenario involves salient non-ML-based trajectory optimization techniques that can be adopted within UAV-based applications for public safety networks. We conclude with a list of open challenges and future works for intelligent path planning of drones using location prediction and trajectory optimization techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1292-4_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Maintaining a system is necessary for a time-saving life because of the comfortable lifestyle and digital security. For instance, we must be concerned about the daily road accidents by automobiles to achieve the security required to construct a smart city. Every year, hundreds of people are killed in car accidents around the world as a result of drowsy drivers. This information emphasizes the importance of a sleep sensor application in preventing such tragedies and, ultimately, saving lives. To address this challenge, we offer a unique intensive learning strategy based on neutral neural networks (CNN). The goal of the chapter is to create a working prototype of a sleepiness detection system that can help to make a smart city. The technology works by keeping an eye on the driver's eyes and sounding the warning while it dries. The system is a non-intrusive real-time control system. The main goal is to improve motorist safety without causing any disruption. The driver’s eyelid is identified in this experiment. When a motorist’s eyes are closed for a long time, the driver is regarded indifferent, and an alert sound. To detect facial features, the Haar Cascade library is utilized, and programming is done in OpenCV.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-7498-3_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The emergence of new trends in technologies contributed to the commencement of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is gaining worldwide attention as well as becoming available for monitoring, diagnosing, forecasting, and preventing emerging communicable diseases. IoT in the medical organization is advantageous and has enabled appropriate control of individuals with COVID-19 by using interconnected wearable sensors and networks. IoT is an evolving area of investigation in infectious disease epidemiology. However, the augmented dangers of communicable diseases transmitted through worldwide integration and the pervasive availability of smart types of machinery, including the interrelatedness of the world, require its utilization for monitoring, averting, predicting, and managing transmittable viruses. This has helped in reducing the circulation rate in the hospital and increasing patient satisfaction. Therefore, this chapter discusses the overall applications of IoT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the significant applications of IoT, challenges, and opportunities of deploying the technologies during the outbreak are presented. This can be of help to identify symptoms and provides better treatment for the outbreak. Taking into account the current situation worldwide, smart disease monitoring systems focused on IoT can be significantly advanced in an attempt to combat the next contagion. With the development of smartphones, wearable devices, and Internet access, IoT’s role will limit the spread of the pandemic by collecting and analyzing data already gathered.

In this paper, we thoroughly study the robustness of uncompressed, distilled, pruned and binarized neural networks against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W, DeepFool, LocalSearch and GenAttack). These new insights facilitate defensive training schemes or reactive filtering methods, where the attack is detected and the input is discarded and/or cleaned. Experimental results are shown for distilled CNNs, agent-based state-of-the-art pruned models, and binarized neural networks (BNNs) such as XNOR-Net and ABC-Net, trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We present evaluation methods to simplify the comparison between CNNs under different attack schemes using loss/accuracy levels, stress-strain graphs, box-plots and class activation mapping (CAM).

Nevertheless, these devices are considered constrained to processing such applications, due to the limitation of battery capacity and high-demand computation for these applications. Mobile cloud comping (MCC) is considered as an appropriate solution for addressing this problem and battery the battery lifetime of these devices, in which the intensive-computation tasks will be offloaded and processed at a conventional centralized cloud. However, cloud computing solution introduces a high communication delay which makes the computation offloading inappropriate for processing real-time applications. To tackle the problem of delay, a new emerging paradigm has been introduced, called mobile edge computing (MEC), in which the computation and storage capabilities of cloud computing have been provided at the edge of the network that enables such applications to be processed as well as satisfying the delay requirements. To this end, compared to other surveys, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art MEC research with a focus on computation offloading on edge-cloud computing combination. In addition, we provide a novel taxonomy on computation offloading at edge-cloud computing combination and introduce the most and common recent computation offloading models regarding this taxonomy.

As discussed in the previous chapter, this has led some researchers to believe that deep learning could hypothetically scale to achieve general intelligence. However, there is increasing consensus (e.g. [57, 210, 230]) that the techniques do not scale as well as was anticipated to harder problems. In particular, deep learning methods find their strength in automatically synthesizing distributed quantitative features from data. These features are useful insofar as they enable mostly reliable classification and regression, and in some limited cases also few- or zero-shot transfer to related tasks. However, it is increasingly questionable whether deep learning methods are appropriate for autonomous roles in environments that are not strongly constrained. While there are still countless use-cases for narrow artificial intelligence, many of the truly transformative use-cases can only be realized by general intelligence",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08020-3_4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

CAs are currently being utilised for diverse clinical applications such as symptom checking, health monitoring, medical triage and diagnosis. Intent classification (IC) is an essential task of understanding user utterance in CAs which makes use of modern deep learning (DL) methods. Because of the inherent model uncertainty associated with those methods, accuracy alone cannot be relied upon in clinical applications where certain errors may compromise patient safety. In this work, we employ Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) to calculate model uncertainty for IC, with a specific emphasis on symptom checker CAs. This method provides a certainty measure with IC prediction that can be utilised in assuring safe response from CAs. We evaluated our method on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data and found mean uncertainty to be much higher for OOD data.

For example, bandwidth, processing power, and power consumption must be addressed while building a possible IoT system. Due to the current epidemic, the need for contactless solutions has risen. Possible solutions include a gesture-based control system that protects user privacy and can operate several different appliances simultaneously. When implementing such gesture-based control systems, opaque box artificial intelligence (AI) models are used. This opaque box AI model has shown good performance metrics on in-distribution data when tested in a lab. However, their complexity and opaqueness make them prone to failure when exposed to real-world out-of-distribution input. In contrast to opaque box models, explainable AI models based on fuzzy logic (EAI-FL) demonstrate comparable performance on lab data distributions.

Detecting road sign can widely prevent people from accidents by respecting the traffic rules.

To address this problem, we propose to build in this paper a new traffic sign detection system based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs).

The fast improvement in communication, sensing and computer technology has given considerable advances to Robot navigation guidance techniques in agriculture. Automatic autonomous robots minimize work expenses, avoid dangerous activities from being carried out by people and give farmers timely and accurate data to help management choices. Appropriate methods for sensing, mapping, localization, trajectory planning, and preventing obstacles are designed through research into robot sensor technologies in agricultural contexts. The Navigation Algorithms must use visual information to determine an acceptable course, execute a selection and navigate appropriately without collisions in its environment. A summary of sensor technology for autonomous prototype vehicles is presented and discussed in this chapter. Navigating sensors, computer methods, and navigation management approaches are the main aspects. Crucial procedures include selecting, coordinating, and combining the appropriate Sensors to provide essential robotics navigational knowledge. For function extraction, processing of data and fusing computationally efficiently are utilized. The steering controllers give the correct steering motion to operate automated vehicles for autonomous navigation. Mobile robots are still an open topic in outside contexts such as in agriculture. To address the challenges posed by the climatic conditions, dynamic surroundings, unforeseen obstructions, terrain variations, and vegetation, it is necessary to provide effective and powerful protective and actuators technologies for mobility farming robotics.

Effective extraction from the agent’s observation, effective utilization of historical information, and efficient communication with neighbor agents are the challenges to completing the cooperative task. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a well-designed model, which utilizes the local states of nearby agents and obstacles and outputs an optimal action for each agent to execute. Our approach has three major components: 1) observation encoder which uses CNN to extract local partial observation and GRU to make full use of historical information, 2) communication block which uses attention mechanism to combine the agent’s partial observation with its neighbors, and 3) decision block with the purpose to output the final action policy. Based on the three major components, all agents formulate their own decentralized policies to apply. Finally, we use success rate and extra time rate to measure our approach and other well-known algorithms.

AI can benefit various stages of real estate development, from planning and construction to occupation and demolition. However, Hong Kong's legal system is currently behind when it comes to technological abilities, while the field of AI safety in built environments is still in its infancy. Negligent design and production processes, irresponsible data management, questionable deployment, algorithm training, sensor design and/or manufacture, unforeseen consequences from multiple data inputs, and erroneous AI operation based on sensor or remote data can all lead to accidents. Yet, determining how legal rules should apply to liability for losses caused by AI systems takes time. Traditional product liability laws can apply for some systems, meaning that the manufacturer will bear responsibility for a malfunctioning part. That said, more complex cases will undoubtedly have to come before the courts to determine whether something unsafe should be the manufacturer's fault or the individual's fault, as well as who should receive the subsequent financial and/or non-financial compensation, etc. Since AI adoption has an inevitable relationship with safety concerns, this project intends to shed light on responsible AI development and usage, with a specific focus on AI safety laws, policies, and people's perceptions. We will conduct a systematic literature review via the PRISMA approach to study the academic perspectives of AI safety policies and laws and data-mining publicly available content on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit to study societal concerns about AI safety in built environments. We will then research court cases and laws related to AI safety in 61 jurisdictions, in addition to policies that have been implemented globally. Two case studies on AI suppliers that sell AI hardware and software to users of built environment will also be included. Another two case studies will be conducted on built environment companies (a contractor and Hong Kong International Airport) that use AI safety tools. The results obtained from social media, court cases, legislation, and policies will be discussed with local and international experts via a workshop, then released to the public to provide the international community and Hong Kong with unique policy and legal orientations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0737-1_3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, cameras generally capture human poses in 2D as images and videos, which can have significant appearance variations across viewpoints that make the recognition tasks challenging. To address this, we explore recognizing similarity in 3D human body poses from 2D information, which has not been well-studied in existing works. Here, we propose an approach to learning a compact view-invariant embedding space from 2D body joint keypoints, without explicitly predicting 3D poses. Input ambiguities of 2D poses from projection and occlusion are difficult to represent through a deterministic mapping, and therefore we adopt a probabilistic formulation for our embedding space. Experimental results show that our embedding model achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera views, in comparison with 3D pose estimation models. We also show that by training a simple temporal embedding model, we achieve superior performance on pose sequence retrieval and largely reduce the embedding dimension from stacking frame-based embeddings for efficient large-scale retrieval. Furthermore, in order to enable our embeddings to work with partially visible input, we further investigate different keypoint occlusion augmentation strategies during training. We demonstrate that these occlusion augmentations significantly improve retrieval performance on partial 2D input poses. Results on action recognition and video alignment demonstrate that using our embeddings without any additional training achieves competitive performance relative to other models specifically trained for each task.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-021-01529-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However deep learning based algorithms are often computationally expensive. That limits the use in many real world scenarios. For decades, researchers have been working on speeding up object detection. One bottleneck in current state-of-the-art methods is the region proposal generation stage as hundreds and thousands of proposed regions need to be processed before detection. Most of the regions are background areas which do not contribute to the actual detection. To improve the efficiency, we propose a region proposal network that can significantly reduce background while maintaining high accuracy. The comparison with SOTA methods shows that our network can be up to 70 times faster, since it only contains 1/15 to 1/150 parameters relative to these methods. The class IoU for MS COCO subsets achieves 40% to 70% and the inference speed on GTX 1080Ti can achieve above 1000 FPS performance. In addition, our study shows that high resolution input is not a must for high accuracy. The use of down-sampled images can further reduce computation costs while retaining or even improving accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-97546-3_50,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This P2P network is generated and maintained by the participating peers in a distributed manner through peer discovery, neighbor selection and managing inbound/outbound connections. As these tasks require extra consumption of network bandwidth, energy, memory and CPU usage, resource-limited devices may not support inherent blockchain applications. Further, changes in the topology control functions or reconfiguration should be considered by all peers to fully benefit from the new performance, which can take time. The aim of this paper is to build a blockchain network in a manner that greatly reduce topology control overhead while guaranteeing the properties such as high flexibility, fast reconfigurability, connectivity, small diameter and clustering. For this, we propose to use the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to manage the blockchain P2P network. This way, the topology control tasks are moved off the peers to a secure overlay layer composed of multiple servers having synchronized databases. This new layer is responsible for building and managing the topological structure of the P2P network layer based on random r -out digraphs. Next, we mathematically discuss r -out digraphs generation using binomial distribution and preferential attachment models. Then, and in order to reduce the number of connections per peer, we establish lower and minimum upper bounds on outbound and inbound connections respectively that still guarantee the P2P network feasibility and connectivity. Further, we investigate topological properties of blockchain P2P network such as connectivity, diameter and clustering. Finally, we provide extensive simulation and numerical results to verify the efficiency of our approach and illustrate the effects of centralized topology control on network performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-021-01248-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The sustainable development of transport requires the development of activities, which yield higher economic and social results while at the same time reduce the negative impact on the environment. In the long term, the sustainable development of transport activities is complex and tied to enormous challenges, difficulties and barriers, related to the development of the technological environment, the social and economic development, the influence of political factors and regulations. One of the central perspectives for the development of the freight transport in Europe is the development of multimodal and intermodal transport. The present chapter reviews some essential issues about the conditions for interaction between the modes of freight transport and the main challenges this kind of transport faces. An overview has been made of the main characteristics of organization and technology in multimodal and intermodal transport, and the related to them commodal and synchro modal transport that have appeared in recent years, as well as the physical internet concept. The application and barriers for modern use of information and communication technologies in multimodal and intermodal transport has been reviewed. An overview of the development of multimodal and intermodal transport in Bulgaria in accordance with the development of international transport corridors that pass through the country is carried out. A mathematical model has been developed on the basis of multicriteria optimization with three criteria: direct costs, time and external costs. The transport scheme is presented as an oriented graph line with each point corresponding to a node and each road, connecting nodes i and j, to an oriented weighted rib (i, j) in the graph. Weight c ij is directly connected to the three criteria set. We assume that on each rib transport can be carried out by three modes: waterway, road and rail. If there is no physical connection, the respective weight is assumed to be an infinitely large number. Pareto optimal solutions have been determined under conditions for integer variables and application of a weighting method. To verify the model, a specific task for providing multimodal transport has been solved with the help of Matlab R2017b software and the optimization functions built into the product have been found to be optimal under Pareto solutions, using heuristic approaches for solving a partially integer linear optimization problem.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87120-8_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the safety critical and real time nature of such systems, this transition emphasizes careful selection of task models, task scheduling mechanisms and software development practices to ensure predictability. Though there exists a wealth of research results on MCS, often the non-uniform descriptions and non-comprehensive nature of task parameters become hindrances to the designers and researchers, thus limiting their wider applicability. In this context, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of task parameters for MCS and propose a task parameter aggregator called TaskMUSTER with focus on automotive domain, specifically on the controlling domain software applications like power steering, brake systems and power train. TaskMSUTER aims to provide a unified view of various task model parameters in terms of important attributes related to resource & communication, energy, fault-tolerance, mode change, OS overheads and parallel processing.

Automated vehicles (AVs) have become central tools for such projects as city governments and industry explore the use and impact of this emerging technology. This paper presents a large-scale assessment of AV pilot projects in U.S. cities to understand how pilot projects are being used to examine the risks and benefits of AVs, how cities integrate these potentially transformative technologies into conventional policy and planning, and how and what they are learning about this technology and its future opportunities and risks. Through interviews with planning practitioners and document analysis, we demonstrate that the approaches cities take for AVs differ significantly, and often lack coherent policy goals. Key findings from this research include: (1) a disconnect between the goals of the pilot projects and a city’s transportation goals; (2) cities generally lack a long-term vision for how AVs fit into future mobility systems and how they might help address transportation goals; (3) an overemphasis of non-transportation benefits of AV pilots projects; (4) AV pilot projects exhibit a lack of policy learning and iteration; and (5) cities are not leveraging pilot projects for public benefits. Overall, urban and transportation planners and decision makers show a clear interest to discover how AVs can be used to address transportation challenges in their communities, but our research shows that while AV pilot projects purport to do this, while having numerous outcomes, they have limited value for informing transportation policy and planning questions around AVs.

Automating learning and intelligence to the full extent remains a challenge. The amalgamation of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning has brought breakthroughs in games and robotics in the past decade.

Motivated by recent successes of DRL, we have explored its adaptability to different domains and application areas. This paper also presents a comprehensive survey of the work done in recent years and simulation tools used for DRL. The current focus of researchers is on recording the experience in a better way, and refining the policy for futuristic moves.

It is now up to the research and industrial sectors to enhance the development of autonomous vehicles based on such guidelines. In the current state of the art, we find studies on how ethical theories can be integrated. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no framework for motion planning has yet been published which allows for the true implementation of any practical ethical policies. This paper makes four contributions: Firstly, we briefly present the state of the art based on recent works concerning unavoidable accidents of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and identify further need for research. While most of the research focuses on decision strategies in moral dilemmas or crash optimization, we aim to develop an ethical trajectory planning for all situations on public roads. Secondly, we discuss several ethical theories and argue for the adoption of the theory “ethics of risk.” Thirdly, we propose a new framework for trajectory planning, with uncertainties and an assessment of risks. In this framework, we transform ethical specifications into mathematical equations and thus create the basis for the programming of an ethical trajectory. We present a risk cost function for trajectory planning that considers minimization of the overall risk, priority for the worst-off and equal treatment of people.

While the advent of connected mobility is expected to benefit travelers and the society by smoothing traffic, improving rider convenience, and reducing accidents, the augmented cyber components in connected and autonomous vehicles and related infrastructure also give rise to cyber-attacks to the transportation system. And yet, little attention has been paid to transportation cyber resilience. This paper thus proposes an investigation on this topic with a comprehensive literature review. The cyber components and plausible autonomous mobility systems (AMS) operation scenarios are discussed, before identifying possible cyber-attacks to AMS at both vehicle and system levels. The discussion then moves to existing practices to enhance cybersecurity, and a number of strategies are investigated toward enhancing AMS cyber resilience. At the vehicle level, creating layers and separation to reduce cyber component connectivity and deploying an independent procedure for data collection and processing are important in vehicle design and manufacturing. At the system level, recommended strategies include keeping redundancy in transportation capacity, maintaining a separate road network, and deploying different sub-autonomous mobility systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12198-021-00230-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Before such a platoon is deployed, it is necessary to ensure the safety of its driving behavior, whereby each vehicle’s behavior is commanded by the decision-making function whose decision is based on the observed driving scenario. However, there is currently a lack of verification methods to ensure the reliability of the scenario-based decision-making process in the platoon system. In this paper, we focus on the platoon driving scenario, whereby the platoon is composed of intelligent heavy trucks driving on cross-sea highways. We propose a formal modeling and verification approach to provide safety assurance for platoon vehicles’ cooperative driving behaviors. The existing Multi-Lane Spatial Logic (MLSL) with a dedicated abstract model can express driving scene spatial properties and prove the safety of multi-lane traffic maneuvers under the single-vehicle perspective. To cater for the platoon system’s multi-vehicle perspective, we modify the existing abstract model and propose a Multi-Agent Spatial Logic (MASL) that extends MLSL by relative orientation and multi-agent observation. We then utilize a timed automata type supporting MASL formulas to model vehicles’ decision controllers for platoon driving. Taking the behavior of a human-driven vehicle (HDV) joining the platoon as a case study, we have implemented the model and verified safety properties on the UPPAAL tool to illustrate the viability of our framework.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11390-021-1565-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recent ethical reports and guidelines raise worries that AVs will introduce injustice or reinforce existing social inequalities in road traffic. One major injustice concern in today’s traffic is that different types of road users are exposed differently to risks of corporal harm. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the responsibility of AV developers to address existing injustice concerns regarding risk exposure as well as approaches on how to fulfill the responsibility for a fairer distribution of risk. In contrast to popular approaches on the ethics of risk distribution in unavoidable accident cases, we focus on low and moderate risk situations, referred to as routine driving. For routine driving, the obligation to distribute risks fairly must be discussed in the context of risk-taking and risk-acceptance, balancing safety objectives of occupants and other road users with driving utility. In the second part of the paper, we present a typical architecture for decentralized automated driving which contains a dedicated module for real-time risk estimation and management.

The system employs an end-to-end approach for identifying, locating, and classifying vehicles in the images. The pre-trained Tiny-YOLOv3 network is adopted as the main reference model and subsequently pruned and simplified by training on the BIT-vehicle dataset, and excluding some of the unnecessary layers. The results indicated advantages of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and speed.

So, it is important to build an automatic system to collect information about vehicles. The license plate is the unique identifier of a vehicle.

The proposed system was based on the Faster R-CNN improved by adding an adaptive attention network for the segmentation of the license plate to retrieve the numbers and the letters of identification. Also, we add a deconvolution layer at the top of the features extraction network to detect the small size of the target license plate. To train and evaluate the proposed system, a dataset was collected for Arabic countries such as Egypt, KSA, and UAE that have similar license plates with Arabic and Indian numbers, Arabic and Latin alphabets. The dataset was collected from the internet using a python script then it was filtered and annotated manually.

Reviewing current traffic rules with particular reference to two driving situations (speeding and mounting the pavement), we illustrate why current traffic rules are not suitable for CAVs and why making new traffic rules specifically for CAVs would be inappropriate. In defining an alternative approach to achieving safe CAV driving behaviours, we describe the use of ethical goal functions as part of hybrid AI systems, suggesting that functions should be defined by governmental bodies with input from citizens and stakeholders. Ethical goal functions for CAVs would enable developers to optimise driving behaviours for safety under conditions of uncertainty whilst allowing for differentiation of products according to brand values. Such functions can differ between regions according to preferences for safety behaviours within that region and can be updated over time, responding to continual socio-technological feedback loops. We conclude that defining ethical goal functions is an urgent and necessary step from governmental bodies to enable the safe and transparent operation of CAVs and accelerate the reduction in road casualties they promise to achieve.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10676-021-09614-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A main challenge comes from each modality capturing a different location of the 3D objects, as opposed to typical multi-spectral imaging scenarios where all image bands observe the same scene. Thus, we refer to this special multi-spectral scenario as multi-layer . We present a multi-task deep learning framework that exploits the dependencies between image bands to produce 3D AR localisation (segmentation and detection) where different image bands (and physical locations) have their own set of results. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of producing dense AR annotations for training supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, we adapt a training strategy based on weak labels (i.e. bounding boxes) in a recursive manner. We compare our detection and segmentation stages against baseline approaches for solar image analysis (multi-channel coronal hole detection, SPOCA for ARs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (Faster RCNN, U-Net). Additionally, both detection and segmentation stages are quantitatively validated on artificially created data of similar spatial configurations made from annotated multi-modal magnetic resonance images. Our framework achieves an average of 0.72 IoU (segmentation) and 0.90 F1 score (detection) across all modalities, comparing to the best performing baseline methods with scores of 0.53 and 0.58, respectively, on the artificial dataset, and 0.84 F1 score in the AR detection task comparing to baseline of 0.82 F1 score.

The DNN-based ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviours due to unexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. Therefore, safety assurance is vital to the ADS. However, DNN-based ADS is a highly complex system that puts forward a strong demand for robustness, more specifically, the ability to predict unexpected driving conditions to prevent potential inconsistent behaviour. It is not possible to generalize the DNN model’s performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the driving conditions that were not considered during the training of the ADS may lead to unpredictable consequences for the safety of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis–based anomaly detection system to prevent the safety-critical inconsistent behaviour of autonomous vehicles at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components. The first component- the inconsistent behaviour predictor, is based on an autoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct the driving scenarios. Based on reconstruction error ( e ) and threshold ( θ ), it determines the normal and unexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behaviour. The second component provides on-the-fly safety guards, that is, it automatically activates healing strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the behaviour. We evaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected anomalous driving scenarios using already available open-sourced DNN-based ADSs in the Udacity simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of DeepGuard can predict up to 93% on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83% on DAVE-2 ADS, and 80% of inconsistent behaviour on the EPOCH ADS model, outperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad . Overall, DeepGuard can prevent up to 89% of all predicted inconsistent behaviours of ADS by executing predefined safety guards.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-021-00310-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These include cost considerations, both capital and infrastructure, as well as technology design elements of range and false alarm rates potentially exacerbated by convolutional neural networks (aka, deep learning). Results also highlight that environmental design elements can provide a possible low-tech solution in the design of obstructions that either eliminate or complicate a drone pilot’s line of sight.

In this context, accountability becomes a matter of building systems that can be challenged, interrogated, and, most importantly, adjusted in use to accommodate counter-intuitive results and unpredictable impacts. Thus, accountable system design can work to reconfigure socio-technical landscapes to protect the users of AI and to prevent unjust apportionment of risk.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01302-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Both tools have been shown to be successful in delivering data-driven solutions for robotics tasks, as well as providing a natural way to develop an end-to-end pipeline from the robot’s sensing to its actuation, passing through the generation of a policy to perform the given task. These frameworks have been proven to be able to deal with real-world complications such as noise in sensing, imprecise actuation, variability in the scenarios where the robot is being deployed, among others. Following that vein, and given the growing interest in DL and DRL, the present work starts by providing a brief tutorial on deep reinforcement learning, where the goal is to understand the main concepts and approaches followed in the field. Later, the article describes the main, recent, and most promising approaches of DL and DRL in robotics, with sufficient technical detail to understand the core of the works and to motivate interested readers to initiate their own research in the area. Then, to provide a comparative analysis, we present several taxonomies in which the references can be classified, according to high-level features, the task that the work addresses, the type of system, and the learning techniques used in the work.

Scientists have tested the power of intelligent algorithms developed to predict (or learn from) natural, physical and social phenomena. This also applies to crime-related research problems. Nonetheless, studies that map the current state of the art at the intersection between AI and crime are lacking. What are the current research trends in terms of topics in this area? What is the structure of scientific collaboration when considering works investigating criminal issues using machine learning, deep learning, and AI in general? What are the most active countries in this specific scientific sphere? Using data retrieved from the Scopus database, this work quantitatively analyzes 692 published works at the intersection between AI and crime employing network science to respond to these questions. Results show that researchers are mainly focusing on cyber-related criminal topics and that relevant themes such as algorithmic discrimination, fairness, and ethics are considerably overlooked. Furthermore, data highlight the extremely disconnected structure of co-authorship networks. Such disconnectedness may represent a substantial obstacle to a more solid community of scientists interested in these topics. Additionally, the graph of scientific collaboration indicates that countries that are more prone to engage in international partnerships are generally less central in the network. This means that scholars working in highly productive countries (e.g. the United States, China) tend to mostly collaborate domestically.

However, researchers found that deep neural networks, as the core algorithm of deep learning technology, are vulnerable to adversarial examples. The adversarial examples are some special input examples which were added small magnitude and carefully crafted perturbations to yield erroneous results with extremely confidence. Hence, they bring serious security risks to deep-learning-based systems. Furthermore, adversarial examples exist not only in the digital world, but also in the physical world. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of adversarial attacks and defenses in the real physical world. First, we reviewed these works that can successfully generate adversarial examples in the digital world, analyzed the challenges faced by applications in real environments. Then, we compare and summarize the work of adversarial examples on image classification tasks, target detection tasks, and speech recognition tasks.

In the current study, we have proposed a framework for reinforcement learning in decentralized collision avoidance where each agent independently makes its decision without communication with others. In an environment exposed to various kinds of dynamic obstacles with irregular movements, mobile robot agents could learn how to avoid obstacles and reach a target point efficiently. Moreover, a path planner was integrated with the reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance to solve the problem of not finding a path in a specific situation, thereby imposing path efficiency. The robots were trained about the policy of obstacle avoidance in environments where dynamic characteristics were considered with soft actor critic algorithm. The trained policy was implemented in the robot operating system (ROS), tested in virtual and real environments for the differential drive wheel robot to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper presents three novel versions of a hybrid method designed to assist in planning such paths for these robots. In this paper, an improvement on Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, namely Adapted-RRT, is presented that uses three well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Incremental Grey Wolf Optimization (I-GWO), and Expanded Grey Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). RRT variants, using these algorithms, are named Adapted-RRT GWO , Adapted-RRT I-GWO , and Adapted-RRT Ex-GWO . The most significant shortcoming of the methods in the original sampling-based algorithm is their inability in finding the optimal paths. On the other hand, the metaheuristic-based algorithms are disadvantaged as they demand a predetermined knowledge of intermediate stations. This study is novel in that it uses the advantages of sampling and metaheuristic methods while eliminating their shortcomings. In these methods, two important operations (length and direction of each movement) are defined that play an important role in selecting the next stations and generating an optimal path. They try to find solutions close to the optima without collision, while providing comparatively efficient execution time and space complexities. The proposed methods have been simulated employing four different maps for three unmanned aerial vehicles, with diverse sets of starting and ending points. The results have been compared among a total of 11 algorithms. The comparison of results shows that the proposed path planning methods generally outperform various algorithms, namely BPIB-RRT*, tGSRT, GWO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, PSO, Improved BA, and WOA.

Five main perspectives about AMAs emerged from our data and were subsequently interpreted and discussed: (i) Machine Ethics: The Way Forward; (ii) Ethical Verification: Safe and Sufficient; (iii) Morally Uncertain Machines: Human Values to Avoid Moral Dystopia; (iv) Human Exceptionalism: Machines Cannot Moralize; and (v) Machine Objectivism: Machines as Superior Moral Agents. A potential source of these differing perspectives is the failure of Machine Ethics to be widely observed or explored as an applied ethic and more than a futuristic end.

After the scheduling, each drone transmits its own data to its associated MEC for enhancing the quality and then eventually the data will be used for surveillance.

While a majority of respondents consider themselves to have little knowledge and familiarity with the topic of AI, the survey nevertheless finds considerable range of relatively ‘plausible’ basic understandings of what AI is. Significantly, repeated questioning highlights a willingness among many people to reassess their opinions once having received further information about AI, and being asked to think through issues relating to AI and society. These patterns remain relatively consistent, regardless of respondents’ political orientation, income, social class and other demographic characteristics.

The proposed technique relies on navigation output and the autonomous vehicles' trajectory decisions for predicting their availability and time duration. The traffic flow is streamlines based on the predictions; the prediction error is mitigated by rescheduling the successive traffic flow. In this process, predictive iterated learning is employed for improving the scalable traffic flows in an intersection.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) aims to manage and optimize the traffic congestion, road accidents, parking allocation using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) system, where the AVs are internally connected for message passing and critical decision making in time-sensitive applications. The data security in such applications can be offered using Blockchain (BC) technology. But, as per the existing literature, there exists no system which can call AVs automatically based on the situation, i.e., call an ambulance in case of an accident, call logistic service in case of home transfer, and call the traffic department in case of traffic jam. Motivated from the aforementioned reasons, in this article, we propose a BC-based secure and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for AV system using beyond 5G communication network. Recently, AVs are facing issues with sensing and tracking technology as well as the data thefts. AV system contains sensitive information and transfers it through a communication channel to Connected AVs (CAVs), where the corrupted information or delay of a fraction of a second can lead to a critical situation. So, here we present possib the attacks and safety countermeasures using BC technology to protect the AV system. The proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and tracking of an object through BC by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers. Also, the beyond 5G network enables communications with low latency and high reliability to meet the desires of the aforementioned time-sensitive applications. The proposed system is evaluated by considering the parameters as mobility and data transfer time against the traditional LTE-A and 5G communication networks.

The novelty of our work is that the meta-model of STTD is constructed based on the domain knowledge of autonomous driving. Our approach, including collection, preprocessing, storage and modeling of STTD as well as the training of AI components, helps to process and utilize huge amount of STTD efficiently. To further demonstrate the usability of our approach, a case study of vehicle behavior prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is discussed. Experimental results show that our approach facilitates the training process of AI components with the STTD.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-021-0938-1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Equipped with domain randomization, Air Learning exposes a UAV agent to a diverse set of challenging scenarios. We seed the toolset with point-to-point obstacle avoidance tasks in three different environments and Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) trainers. Air Learning assesses the policies’ performance under various quality-of-flight (QoF) metrics, such as the energy consumed, endurance, and the average trajectory length, on resource-constrained embedded platforms like a Raspberry Pi. We find that the trajectories on an embedded Ras-Pi are vastly different from those predicted on a high-end desktop system, resulting in up to $$40\%$$ 40 % longer trajectories in one of the environments. To understand the source of such discrepancies, we use Air Learning to artificially degrade high-end desktop performance to mimic what happens on a low-end embedded system. We then propose a mitigation technique that uses the hardware-in-the-loop to determine the latency distribution of running the policy on the target platform (onboard compute on aerial robot). A randomly sampled latency from the latency distribution is then added as an artificial delay within the training loop. Training the policy with artificial delays allows us to minimize the hardware gap (discrepancy in the flight time metric reduced from 37.73% to 0.5%). Thus, Air Learning with hardware-in-the-loop characterizes those differences and exposes how the onboard compute’s choice affects the aerial robot’s performance. We also conduct reliability studies to assess the effect of sensor failures on the learned policies. All put together, Air Learning enables a broad class of deep RL research on UAVs.

During the deployment of IoT-based Cloud applications, the demand for Cloud tenants is dynamic that makes challenging to maintain scalability of the system. Developing an effective scaling technique is not merely a big concern, but how to achieve autonomic scaling results using future load prediction and migration policies is also a crucial phase. Also, to evaluate such auto-scaling strategy, certain Quality of Service (QoS) metrics must be recognized, explored and leveraged to enhance the performance of the system.

This requires age-appropriate tools that allow students to develop a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning in order to become creators of smart solutions. Following the trend of visual languages for introducing algorithms and programming in K-12, we present a ten-year systematic mapping of emerging visual tools that support the teaching of Machine Learning at this educational stage and analyze the tools concerning their educational characteristics, support for the development of ML models as well as their deployment and how the tools have been developed and evaluated. As a result, we encountered 16 tools targeting students mostly as part of short duration extracurricular activities. Tools mainly support the interactive development of ML models for image recognition tasks using supervised learning covering basic steps of the ML process. Being integrated into popular block-based programming languages (primarily Scratch and App Inventor), they also support the deployment of the created ML models as part of games or mobile applications.

Based on a vast systematic review of the literature on Artificial Intelligence Regulation (AIR) published between 2010 and 2020, a dispersed body of knowledge loosely centred around the “framework” concept was organised, described, and pictured for better understanding. The resulting integrative framework encapsulates 21 prior depictions of the policy-making process, aiming to achieve gold-standard societal values, such as fairness, freedom and long-term sustainability. This challenge of integrating the AIR literature was matched by the identification of a structural common ground among different approaches. The AIR framework results from an effort to identify and later analytically deduce synthetic, and generic tool for a country-specific, stakeholder-aware analysis of AIR matters. Theories and principles as diverse as Agile and Ethics were combined in the “AIR framework”, which provides a conceptual lens for societies to think collectively and make informed policy decisions related to what, when, and how the uses and applications of AI should be regulated. Moreover, the AIR framework serves as a theoretically sound starting point for endeavours related to AI regulation, from legislation to research and development. As we know, the (potential) impacts of AI on society are immense, and therefore the discourses, social negotiations, and applications of this technology should be guided by common grounds based on contemporary governance techniques, and social values legitimated via dialogue and scientific research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10676-021-09593-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Developers can optimise their applications iteratively, starting with a generic setup and refining it step by step towards their specific pervasive computing scenario.

Based on the results of these analyses, a subsequent broader analysis is provided, from a position vantage, to (i) identify the efforts made in applying AI technologies in SDGs, (ii) pinpoint opportunities for further progress along the current decade, and (iii) distill ongoing challenges and target areas for important advances. The analysis is organized into six categories or perspectives of human needs: life, economic and technological development, social development, equality, resources and natural environment.

In this paper, we analyze a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems organized in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems.

The horizon of the applications of AI and deep learning has changed the perspective of the human mind. Initially, what used to be thought of as the subtle impossible task is applicable today, and that too in the feasibly efficient way. Computer vision tasks powered with highly tuned CNNs are outperforming humans in many fields. Introductory implementations of the autonomous vehicle were merely achieved using raw image processing, and hard programmed rule-based logic systems along with machine/deep learning were used as secondary objective handlers. With the autonomous driving method proposed by Nvidia, the usability of CNNs is more adequate, adaptable, and applicable. In this paper, we propose the ensemble implementation of CNN-based regression models for autonomous driving. We have taken simulator generated driving view image dataset along with a mapped file of steering angle in radians. After applying image pre-processing and augmentation, we have used two CNN models along with their ensemble and compared their performance to minimize the risks of unsafe driving. We have compared Nvidia proposed CNN, MobileNet-V2 as regression model and Ensemble-M results for comparison of their respective performance, MSE scores and compute time to process. In result analysis, the MobileNet-V2 model performs better in densely featured roads and the Nvidia model performs better in sparsely featured roads, whereas Ensemble-M normalizes the performance of both models and efficiently results in the least MSE score (0.0201) with the highest computation time utilization making autonomous driving better, safer alternative.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-05954-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In response, we develop a comprehensive analysis of the relevant arguments for and against creating AMAs, and we argue that all things considered we have strong reasons to continue to responsibly develop AMAs.

First, to provide the first comprehensive response to the important arguments made against AMAs by Wynsberghe and Robbins (in “Critiquing the Reasons for Making Artificial Moral Agents”, Science and Engineering Ethics 25, 2019) and to introduce several novel lines of argument in the process. Second, to collate and thematise for the first time the key arguments for and against AMAs in a single paper.

These features provide a way to rapidly incorporate global context into the informative path planning process by partitioning the state space or the path space of a robot. Our first algorithm, hierarchical hotspot information gathering, uses a topological state space partitioning by constructing a high-level map of information hotspots. We then solve a global scheduling problem over the topological graph, the solution of which is then used for path planning by a set of local greedy coverage planners within each hotspot. Our second algorithm, Topology-Aware Self Organizing Maps, extends the Self Organizing Map algorithm to discover prominent topological features in the information function. These features are used to perform a topological path space decomposition to provide a Stochastic Gradient Ascent optimization algorithm with topologically diverse initialization, improving its performance. In simulated trials and field experiments, we compare the tradeoffs of these two approaches and show that our methods that leverage topological features of the information field consistently perform competitively or better than methods that do not exploit these features, while requiring less computation time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-021-10012-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It permits to protect a restricted area from intruders using a concentric circles model where simulated UAVs evolve in these so-called security rings. Having UAVs arranged in rings fosters an early detection (outer ring) while increases the reliability of the surveillance system featuring a last detection barrier (inner ring). Using the first return map from a chaotic attractor (an unpredictable sequence of real numbers) and a dynamic pheromone map, the UAV swarm members make a collective decision about their trajectories evaluating the options of a best-of- n problem. As a result, routes are unpredictable and detection rates are optimised. The parameters of each UAV, i.e. amount of pheromones and ring assignation, has been tuned using a specifically designed evolutionary algorithm. The performance of CONSOLE has been compared to five state-of-the-art mobility models on 20 case studies comprising 30 different scenarios each.

However, due to the intrinsic openness of wireless communication channels in IoD, the data generated by drones are facing new security challenges and privacy issues. To ensure the confidentiality of data communication, it is crucial to authenticate remote users and establish session keys for IoD through the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Unfortunately, most existing AKA protocols using asymmetric cryptographic primitives are computationally expensive, and are unaffordable for the computing power limited drones. To this end, this paper presents an efficient three-factor AKA protocol for IoD based on FourQ and Boyko-Peinado-Venkatesan (BPV) pre-calculation. The detailed security analysis reveals that our protocol is secure against known attacks and achieves important security goals, especially perfect forward secrecy. Besides, by performing real world experiments on the Raspberry Pi, we demonstrate that the improved FourQ curve primitive is 4–5 times faster than the conventional elliptic curve primitives.

As the number of interconnected devices increases, sensitive data disclosure becomes an important issue that needs to be addressed. In order to prevent the disclosure of sensitive data, effective and feasible privacy preservation strategies are necessary. A noise-based privacy-preserving model has been proposed in this article. The components of the noise-based privacy-preserving model include Multilevel Noise Treatment for data collection; user preferences-based data classifier to classify sensitive and non-sensitive data; Noise Removal and Fuzzification Mechanism for data access and user-customized privacy preservation mechanism. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed model. The results have been compared with existing approaches. The experimental results show an improvement in the proposed noise-based privacy-preserving model in terms of computational overhead. The comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model without the fuzzifier has around 52–77% less computational overhead than the Data access control scheme and 46–70% less computational overhead compared to the Dynamic Privacy Protection model. The proposed model with the fuzzifier has around 48–73% less computational overhead compared to the Data access control scheme and 31–63% less computational overhead compared to the Dynamic Privacy Protection model. Furthermore, the privacy analysis has been done with the relevant approaches.

While cloning behaviors provided by an expert is a promising approach to the exploration problem, learning from a fixed set of demonstrations may be impracticable due to lack of state coverage or distribution mismatch—when the learner’s goal deviates from the demonstrated behaviors. Besides, we are interested in learning how to reach a wide range of goals from the same set of demonstrations. In this work we propose a novel goal-conditioned method that leverages very small sets of goal-driven demonstrations to massively accelerate the learning process. Crucially, we introduce the concept of active goal-driven demonstrations to query the demonstrator only in hard-to-learn and uncertain regions of the state space. We further present a strategy for prioritizing sampling of goals where the disagreement between the expert and the policy is maximized.

These networks depend upon the mobility of vehicular-relay nodes, which can adopt the store–carry–forward arrangement and provide consent to utilize their resources for packet forwarding. In reality, vehicular-relay nodes drop packets because of a lack of resources and selfish behavior, leading to potential failures in networks. The reason for this failure in performance is the absence of an efficient relay node selection strategy. Typically, vehicular delay networks can provide communication solutions in challenging conditions when other traditional networks fail to perform due to disconnection. However, if the routing strategy does not consider nodes’ selfish nature and relay nodes’ inefficiency, packet drops continue, and the approach will fail to perform. This paper proposes a routing strategy, known as the best-choice vehicular-relay selection strategy for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission, to overcome this breakdown situation. The proposed strategy selects the best-performing vehicular-relay nodes and restricts the packet replication to low-performing vehicular nodes. The proposed routing strategy selects the best-choice relay nodes based on their past performance. Numerical analysis and our simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms some of the leading routing strategies in its class by increasing the delivery probability, decreasing the overhead ratio, average latency, and the number of dropped packets in the vehicular network.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06106-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, two critical issues prevent federated learning to be effectively deployed on resource-constrained devices in large scale. First, federated learning causes high energy consumption which can badly hurt the battery lifetime of mobile devices. Second, leakage of sensitive personal information still occurs during the training process. Thus, a system that can effectively protect the sensitive information while improving the energy efficiency is urgently required for a mobile-based federated learning system. This paper proposes SmartDL, an energy-aware decremental learning framework that well balances the energy efficiency and data privacy in an efficient manner. SmartDL improves the energy efficiency from two levels: (1) global layer, which adopts an optimization approach to select a subset of participating devices with sufficient capacity and maximum reward. (2) local layer, which adopts a novel decremental learning algorithm to actively provides the decremental and incremental updates, and can adaptively tune the local DVFS at the same time. We prototyped SmartDL on physical testbed and evaluated its performance using several learning benchmarks with real-world traces. The evaluation results show that compared with the original federated learning, SmartDL can reduce energy consumption by 75.6–82.4% in different datasets.

Moreover, this virus is increasing exponentially day-by-day and a huge amount of data from this disease is also generated at the fast pace. So, there is a need to store, manage, and analyze this huge amount of data efficiently to get meaningful insights from it, which further helps medical professionals to tackle this global pandemic situation. Moreover, this data is to be passed through an open channel, i.e., the Internet, which opens the doors for the intruders to perform some malicious activities. Blockchain (BC) emerges as a technology that can manage the data in an efficient, transparent manner and also preserve the privacy of all the stakeholders. It can also aid in transaction authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments.

However, these road intersections are generally represented as point elements without detailed information, or are even not available in current versions of crowdsourced mapping databases including OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study proposes an approach to automatically detect road objects from street-level images and place them to correct locations according to urban rules. Our processing pipeline relies on two convolutional neural networks: the first one segments the images, while the second one detects and classifies the specific objects. Moreover, to locate the detected objects, we propose an attributed topological binary tree (ATBT) based on urban rules for each image in an image sequence to depict the coherent relations of topologies, attributes and semantics of the road objects. Then the ATBT is further matched with map features on OSM to determine the right placed location. The proposed method has been applied to a case study in Berlin, Germany. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two object classes: traffic signs and traffic lights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed app roach provides promising results in terms of completeness and positional accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43762-021-00019-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These networks, though, have achieved good recognition accuracy, they incur high computational costs and memory utilization. These issues restrict their deployment in real-world applications, which demands the FER systems to run on resource-constrained embedded devices in real-time. Thus, to alleviate these issues and to develop a robust and efficient method for automatic recognition of facial emotions in the wild with real-time performance, this paper presents a novel deep integrated CNN model, named EmNet (Emotion Network). The EmNet model consists of two structurally similar DCNN models and their integrated variant, jointly-optimized using a joint-optimization technique. For a given facial image, the EmNet gives three predictions, which are fused using two fusion schemes, namely average fusion and weighted maximum fusion, to obtain the final decision. To test the efficiency of the proposed FER pipeline on a resource-constrained embedded platform, we optimized the EmNet model and the face detector using TensorRT SDK and deploy the complete FER pipeline on the Nvidia Xavier device. Our proposed EmNet model with 4.80M parameters and 19.3MB model size attains notable improvement over the current state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy with multi-fold improvement in computational efficiency.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02125-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Border patrol agents act as moving sensors in a border region, and the border patrol agents’ coverage moves around the region dynamically, increasing the chance of approaching a trespassing agent. Typically, the locations of trespassing agents cannot be fully observed due to the size of the border region and obstacles. In addition, intelligent trespassing agents may dynamically adjust their traveling paths so that the border patrol agents cannot predict their locations easily. Trespassing agents are assumed to leave traces that indicate their footprints, providing their estimated locations. Border patrol agents may use the trespassers’ footprints as partial information to leverage patrol path planning. We propose an adaptive border patrol process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which an individual border patrol agent’s decision is determined dynamically on the basis of trespassing agents’ partially observed locations. The observations are shared among individual border patrol agents, allowing the border patrol agents to cooperate. The zoning technique is used to limit the planning scope of an individual border patrol agent, and Monte Carlo simulation is applied to reduce the complexity of the POMDP planning problem. Empirical experiments are conducted by means of simulated agents. The simulation parameters are derived from the interviews with a group of border patrol experts. The results in different scenarios show that the proposed patrol path planning scheme outperforms other patrol path planning schemes in terms of the trespasser detection rate. The simulation results are validated with respect to subject matter experts (SMEs), where SMEs are the same border patrol experts who had given the interviews. The proposed method has potential in border surveillance as an assisting system for human border patrol or an automated guidance system in robots or drones.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02068-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Modeling and field-testing efforts are demonstrating that shared mobility coupled with AV technology for automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) service may significantly impact levels of service and environmental outcomes in future cities. Given these rapidly emerging developments, there is an urgent need for methods to adequately quantify the economic impacts of new vehicle technologies and future urban mobility policy. In this paper, we show how broader user-centric impacts can be captured by the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, which takes advantage of the rich data and outcomes of utility-maximization activity-based models and its interaction with mesoscale agent-based traffic simulation frameworks. Using the SimMobility simulator, we evaluate shared AMoD strategies applied to a Singapore micromodel city testbed. A near-future strategy of exclusive availability of AMoD service in the central business district (CBD), and a further-horizon strategy of the full operation of AMoD city-wide in the absence of other on-demand services, were tested and evaluated. Our results provide insights into the income and accessibility effects on the population under the implementation of shared and automated mobility policies. The outcomes indicate that the city-wide deployment of AMoD results in greater accessibility and network performance. Moreover, the accessibility of low-income individuals is improved relative to that of mid- and high-income individuals. The restriction of AMoD to the CBD along with the operation of other on-demand services, however, provides a certain level of disbenefit to segments of the population in two exceptional cases. The first is to high-income individuals who live in a suburban zone and rely heavily on on-demand services; the second is to mid-income residents that have excellent public transportation coverage with close proximity to the CBD. We further establish the efficacy of the ABA measure, as these findings motivate the need for measuring socioeconomic impacts at the individual level. The work presented here serves as a foundation for policy evaluation in real-world urban models for future mobility paradigms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-020-10106-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The emerging reinforcement learning-based task offloading strategies have attracted attention of researchers, but the incomplete Markov models in them result in limited improvements. This work proposes a graph convolutional network-based reinforcement learning (GRL-based) method to enhance the reinforcement learning-based task offloading in MEC. The Graph Convolutional Network is introduced to extract features from tasks through regarding the task set as a directed acyclic graph. Then we construct a complete Markov model for the offloading strategy. In the proposed GRL-based method, the decision process is deployed in the user layer, while the training process is deployed in the cloud layer. An off-policy reinforcement learning method, soft actor-critic, is used to train the offloading strategy, by which the sampling and training can be implemented separately. Several simulation experiments show the proposed GRL-based method performs better than baseline methods, and it can achieve continuous decisions for task offloading efficiently.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11130-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The spread of fire in enclosed compartments is a highly uncertain and nonlinear process. Hence, in safety-critical cases, any false negatives pose a serious threat to the safety of individuals such as firefighters that are engaged in rescue activities. This work aims to model the nonlinear fire spread behaviour as a temporal, deep learning-based regressive methodology. The objective is to efficiently identify abrupt and extreme temperature changes that often result in increases of 300+ °C. A major challenge in such time-series models is that of learning from historic time-series samples which are known to suffer from high noise levels, outliers and data imbalance. This work contributes on the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology to handle temperature data originating from body-mounted and fixed sensors and develop a temperature increase warning mechanism. The main contribution exploits the contextualisation ability of CNN-LSTM to predict temperature changes in windows of 5–120 s. The model identifies the spatial temperature change patterns via a CNN encoder, which are then fed into an LSTM network. This regression mechanism is trained and validated against a set of unique fire spread conditions and involved live tests ranging from containers to residential and industrial units. The model’s performance was evaluated with MAPE sensitivity analysis against data originating from body-mounted sensors and third-party NIST datasets. The outcome showed an error ranging from 0.89 to 2.05% to 5.46% and 6.23%, respectively. The model efficacy was also evaluated against a range of input–output temperature ranges from 5, 30 to 120-s windows and showed a FN rate of 2.15% for pre-alarm-to-normal and 3.11% for alarm-to-pre-alarm cases in body-mounted sensors and a higher FN rate of 5.14% reported for pre-alarm-to-normal case for the raised platfor sensor tests.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06033-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Nevertheless, its crucial challenge lies in how to model multiple complicated spatial dependencies between different regions, dynamic temporal laws among different time intervals with external factors such as holidays, events, and weather. Some existing work leverage the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore temporal relations and spatial relations, respectively; which have outperformed the classical statistical methods. However, it is difficult for these approaches to jointly model spatial and temporal correlations. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic deep hybrid spatio-temporal neural network namely DHSTNet, to predict traffic flows in every region of a city with high accuracy. In particular, our DSHTNet model comprises four properties i.e., closeness volume, daily volume, trend volume, and external branch, respectively. Moreover, the projected model dynamically assigns different weights to various branches and, then, integrate outputs of four properties to produce final prediction outcomes. The model has been evaluated, both for offline and online predictions, using an edge/fog infrastructure where training happens on the remote cloud and prediction occurs at the edge i.e. in the proximity of users. Extensive experiments and evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model, in terms of high accuracy over prevailing state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, we apply the exaggeration approach based on an attention mechanism to the above model, called as AAtt-DHSTNet; to predict citywide short-term traffic crowd flows; and show its notable performance in the traffic flows prediction. The aggregation method collects information from the related time series, remove redundancy and, thus, increases prediction speed and accuracy. Our empirical evaluation suggests that the AAtt-DHSTNet model is approximately 20.8% and 8.8% more accurate than the DHSTNet technique, for two different real-world traffic datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10486-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Those interfaces can be utilized for simultaneous transmission of a single TCP flow using Multipath TCP (MPTCP). MPTCP is a protocol that is designed to increase end-to-end throughput and reliability of communications by splitting data through multiple parallel paths. Although delay in MPTCP enhanced significantly in the recent years, high number of data transmissions remains an issue. In this paper, we reduce MPTCP delay by reducing the number of transmissions using Opportunistic Routing (OR) technique. OR is a routing model used to increase the delivery rate and reliability of data transmission in wireless networks by using the broadcasting method. This enables each subflow data to be delivered by multiple relays. We adapted OR on a number of MPTCP protocols namely, traditional MPTCP, Multipath TCP Traffic Splitting Control (MPTCP-TSC) and Redundant MPTCP (ReMP TCP) in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The results show that OR-based MPTCP schemes outperform existing schemes. We further compared the OR-based MPTCP protocols in terms of startup delay and energy efficiency.

A large part of these vehicles will be electrically driven and connected to a vehicular network. Rapid advancements in vehicular technology and communications have led to the evolution of vehicular edge computing (VEC). Computation resource allocation is a vehicular network’s primary operations as vehicles have limited onboard computation. Different resource allocation schemes in VEC operate in different environments such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, software defined networks and require specific network performance characteristics for their operations to achieve maximum efficiency. At present, researchers have proposed numerous computation resource allocation schemes which optimize parameters such as power consumption, network stability, quality of service (QoS), etc. These schemes are based on widely used optimization and mathematical models such as the Markov process, Shannon’s law, etc. So, there is a need to present an organized overview of these schemes to help in the future research of the same.

Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges.

New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS.

Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully.

Typically, DNNs are subjected to both types of testing during their development life cycle where offline testing is applied immediately after DNN training and online testing follows after offline testing and once a DNN is deployed within a specific application environment. In this paper, we study the relationship between offline and online testing. Our goal is to determine how offline testing and online testing differ or complement one another and if offline testing results can be used to help reduce the cost of online testing? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end controls of steering functions of self-driving vehicles. Our results show that offline testing is less effective than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.

VPR is related to the concepts of localisation, loop closure, image retrieval and is a critical component of many autonomous navigation systems ranging from autonomous vehicles to drones and computer vision systems. While the concept of place recognition has been around for many years, VPR research has grown rapidly as a field over the past decade due to improving camera hardware and its potential for deep learning-based techniques, and has become a widely studied topic in both the computer vision and robotics communities. This growth however has led to fragmentation and a lack of standardisation in the field, especially concerning performance evaluation. Moreover, the notion of viewpoint and illumination invariance of VPR techniques has largely been assessed qualitatively and hence ambiguously in the past. In this paper, we address these gaps through a new comprehensive open-source framework for assessing the performance of VPR techniques, dubbed “VPR-Bench”. VPR-Bench (Open-sourced at: https://github.com/MubarizZaffar/VPR-Bench ) introduces two much-needed capabilities for VPR researchers: firstly, it contains a benchmark of 12 fully-integrated datasets and 10 VPR techniques, and secondly, it integrates a comprehensive variation-quantified dataset for quantifying viewpoint and illumination invariance. We apply and analyse popular evaluation metrics for VPR from both the computer vision and robotics communities, and discuss how these different metrics complement and/or replace each other, depending upon the underlying applications and system requirements. Our analysis reveals that no universal SOTA VPR technique exists, since: (a) state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance is achieved by 8 out of the 10 techniques on at least one dataset, (b) SOTA technique in one community does not necessarily yield SOTA performance in the other given the differences in datasets and metrics. Furthermore, we identify key open challenges since: (c) all 10 techniques suffer greatly in perceptually-aliased and less-structured environments, (d) all techniques suffer from viewpoint variance where lateral change has less effect than 3D change, and (e) directional illumination change has more adverse effects on matching confidence than uniform illumination change. We also present detailed meta-analyses regarding the roles of varying ground-truths, platforms, application requirements and technique parameters. Finally, VPR-Bench provides a unified implementation to deploy these VPR techniques, metrics and datasets, and is extensible through templates.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-021-01469-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Meanwhile, a flow-to-flow pose estimator (F2FPE) is proposed to exploit the relationship between pairwise images. The two estimators are constrained through a simple yet effective consistency loss in training. Empirical evaluation has shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning-based methods by a large margin and performs comparably to supervised and traditional ones on the KITTI and Malaga dataset.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05545-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The proposed FS-CNN is used to detect faces on large scale images then analyzing face landmarks to predict expressions for emotion recognition. The FS-CNN is composed form two stages, patch cropping, and convolutional neural networks. The first stage is used to detect faces in high-resolution images and crop the face for further processing. The second stage is a convolutional neural network used to predict facial expression based on landmarks analytics, it was applied on pyramid images to process scale invariance. The proposed FS-CNN was trained and evaluated on the UMD Faces dataset. High performance was achieved with a mean average precision of about 95%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-10918-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Firstly, augmented intelligence for restricted natural language requirement modeling is proposed. In that, several AI technologies such as natural language processing and clustering are used to recommend candidate terms to the glossary, as well as machine learning is used to predict the category of requirements. The glossary including data dictionary and domain glossary and the category of requirements will be used in the restricted natural language requirement specification method RNLReq, which is equipped with a set of restriction rules and templates to structure and restrict the way how users document requirements. Secondly, automatic generation of SysML architecture models from the RNLReq requirement specifications is presented. Thirdly, the prototype tool is implemented based on Papyrus.

This form of ‘somatic surveillance’ (Hayles, Unthought: the power of the cognitive nonconscious. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2017, p. 11) increasingly relies on behavioural biometrics and sensory algorithms to verify the physiology of bodies in cabin interiors. Such processes secure cyber-physical space, but also register user capabilities for control that yield data as insured risk. In this technical re-formation of human–machine interactions for control and communication ‘a dissonance of attribution’ (Hancock et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 116(16):7684, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1805770115 ) is created between perceptions of phenomena, materials and decision-making. This reconfigures relations not only between humans and machines, objects and subjects, but possibly disrupts attributive functions in the social system of Law. What it requires is shifting a legal accountability for action from a sovereignty of the human to a new materialist account based on a ‘cognitive assemblage’ between physiological data, computation and algorithmic sensing. This paper investigates the function of law as a guidance system to acknowledge this account of sensory and algorithmic computation as autonomous ‘sensing agents’ (Hansen, Feed-forward: on the future of twenty-first-century media.

Therefore, this article will outline several key approaches to assessing communication, associated data requirements, example applications, verification of methods through HAT use cases, and lessons learned, where applicable. Some approaches are based on the structure of team communication; others draw from dynamical systems theory to consider perspectives across different timescales; other approaches leverage features of team members’ voices or facial expressions to detect emotional states that can provide windows into other workings of the team; still others consider the content of communication to produce insights.

In this report, we review recent algorithmic development in making multi-robot systems robust to environmental uncertainties, failures, and adversarial attacks. Recent Findings We find the following three trends in the recent research in the area of multi-robot coordination: (1) resilient coordination to either withstand failures and/or attack or recover from failures/attacks; (2) risk-aware coordination to manage the trade-off risk and reward, where the risk stems due to environmental uncertainty; (3) Graph neural networks based coordination to learn decentralized multi-robot coordination policies. These algorithms have been applied to tasks such as formation control, task assignment and scheduling, search and planning, and informative data collection. Summary In order for multi-robot systems to become practical, we need coordination algorithms that can scale to large teams of robots dealing with dynamically changing, failure-prone, contested, and uncertain environments. There has been significant recent research on multi-robot coordination that has contributed resilient and risk-aware algorithms to deal with these issues and reduce the gap between theory and practice. Learning-based approaches have been seen to be promising, especially since they can learn who, when, and how to communicate for effective coordination. However, these algorithms have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and as such developing learning-based coordination strategies that are resilient to such attacks and robust to uncertainties is an important open area of research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43154-021-00046-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The recent trend of such surveillance systems has been to embrace the use of advanced deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks for the task of detection, monitoring or tracking. In this paper, we focus on the security of an automated surveillance system that is responsible for vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR). We introduce an adversarial attack against such VMMR systems through adversarially learnt patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed adversarial patches against VMMR through experimental evaluations on a real-world vehicle surveillance dataset.

This taxonomy is then used to review existing techniques and to investigate current challenges that require careful attention and consideration. Based on the taxonomy, IoT DI techniques can be classified into five categories based on the factors that support distributed functionality and data acquisition: cloud-computing, mist-computing, distributed-ledger-technology, service-oriented-computing and hybrid. Existing techniques are compared and categorized mainly based on related challenges, and the level of intelligence supported. We evaluate more than thirty current research efforts in this area.

In recent years, clouds provide services to facilitate this process, but it introduces new security threats of data breaches. Modern encryption techniques ensure security and are considered as the best option to protect stored data and data in transit from an unauthorized third-party. However, a decryption process is necessary when the data must be processed or analyzed, falling into the initial problem of data vulnerability. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is considered the holy grail of cryptography. It allows a non-trustworthy third-party resource to process encrypted information without disclosing confidential data. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental concepts of FHE, practical implementations, state-of-the-art approaches, limitations, advantages, disadvantages, potential applications, and development tools focusing on neural networks. In recent years, FHE development demonstrates remarkable progress. However, current literature in the homomorphic neural networks is almost exclusively addressed by practitioners looking for suitable implementations. It still lacks comprehensive and more thorough reviews. We focus on the privacy-preserving homomorphic encryption cryptosystems targeted at neural networks identifying current solutions, open issues, challenges, opportunities, and potential research directions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-021-01076-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1631/FITEE.1900637,Pre-training with asynchronous supervised learning for reinforcement learning based autonomous driving,Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering,10.1631/FITEE.1900637,Springer,5/1/2021,"Rule-based autonomous driving systems may suffer from increased complexity with large-scale intercoupled rules, so many researchers are exploring learning-based approaches. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied in designing autonomous driving systems because of its outstanding performance on a wide variety of sequential control problems. However, poor initial performance is a major challenge to the practical implementation of an RL-based autonomous driving system. RL training requires extensive training data before the model achieves reasonable performance, making an RL-based model inapplicable in a real-world setting, particularly when data are expensive. We propose an asynchronous supervised learning (ASL) method for the RL-based end-to-end autonomous driving model to address the problem of poor initial performance before training this RL-based model in real-world settings. Specifically, prior knowledge is introduced in the ASL pre-training stage by asynchronously executing multiple supervised learning processes in parallel, on multiple driving demonstration data sets. After pre-training, the model is deployed on a real vehicle to be further trained by RL to adapt to the real environment and continuously break the performance limit. The presented pre-training method is evaluated on the race car simulator, TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator), to verify that it can be sufficiently reliable in improving the initial performance and convergence speed of an end-to-end autonomous driving model in the RL training stage. In addition, a real-vehicle verification system is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed pre-training method in a real-vehicle deployment. Simulations results show that using some demonstrations during a supervised pre-training stage allows significant improvements in initial performance and convergence speed in the RL training stage. 基于人定规则所设计的自动驾驶系统可能会因大规模相互耦合的规则而变得越来越复杂, 因此许多研究人员致力于探索基于学习的解决方案. 强化学习 (reinforcement learning, RL) 因其在各种顺序控制问题上的出色表现而被应用于自动驾驶系统设计. 然而, 基于RL的自动驾驶系统落地应用所面临的主要挑战是其初始性能不佳. 强化学习训练需要大量训练数据, 然后模型才能达到合理的性能要求, 这使得基于强化学习的模型不适用于现实环境, 尤其在数据昂贵的情况下. 本文为基于强化学习的端到端自动驾驶模型提出一种异步监督学习 (asynchronous supervised learning, ASL) 方法, 以解决在实际环境中训练基于强化学习模型时初始性能差的问题. 具体而言, 通过在多个驾驶演示数据集上并行且异步执行多个监督学习过程, 在异步监督学习预训练阶段引入先验知识。经过预训练后, 模型将被部署到真实车辆上进一步开展强化学习训练, 以适应实际环境并不断突破性能极限. 本文在赛车模拟器TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator) 上对所提出的预训练方法进行评估, 以验证该方法在改善强化学习训练阶段端到端自动驾驶模型的初始性能和收敛速度方面足够可靠. 此外, 建立一个实车验证系统, 以验证所提预训练方法在实车部署中的可行性. 仿真结果表明, 在有监督的预训练阶段使用一些演示, 可以显著提高强化学习训练阶段的初始性能和收敛速度.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/FITEE.1900637,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In a surveillance paradigm, these events range from abuse to fighting and road accidents to snatching, etc. Due to the sparse occurrence of anomalous events, anomalous activity recognition from surveillance videos is a challenging research task. The approaches reported can be generally categorized as handcrafted and deep learning-based. Most of the reported studies address binary classification i.e. anomaly detection from surveillance videos. But these reported approaches did not address other anomalous events e.g. abuse, fight, road accidents, shooting, stealing, vandalism, and robbery, etc. from surveillance videos. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an effective framework for the recognition of different real-world anomalies from videos. This study provides a simple, yet effective approach for learning spatiotemporal features using deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks (3D ConvNets) trained on the University of Central Florida (UCF) Crime video dataset. Firstly, the frame-level labels of the UCF Crime dataset are provided, and then to extract anomalous spatiotemporal features more efficiently a fine-tuned 3D ConvNets is proposed. Findings of the proposed study are twofold 1) There exist specific, detectable, and quantifiable features in UCF Crime video feed that associate with each other 2) Multiclass learning can improve generalizing competencies of the 3D ConvNets by effectively learning frame-level information of dataset and can be leveraged in terms of better results by applying spatial augmentation. The proposed study extracted 3D features by providing frame level information and spatial augmentation to a fine-tuned pre-trained model, namely 3DConvNets. Besides, the learned features are compact enough and the proposed approach outperforms significantly from state of art approaches in terms of accuracy on anomalous activity recognition having 82% AUC.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-10570-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The extraction and fitting problems of lane markers from the road images have been addressed in recent research studies.

In this work, a novel method based on a low complexity but efficient functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model is proposed to estimate the entire lane by interpolating the lane markers under different road scenarios. The road image is divided into regions and the extracted lane markers from each region are employed in the proposed trigonometric, polynomial, exponential, and Chebyshev functional expansion based FLANN models for the estimation of the lane curvature. The performance of each model is evaluated and tested on road images using three standard datasets. In terms of mean accuracy and computational time out of four FLANN models, the Chebyshev FLANN (CFLNN) outperforms other three proposed methods.

At a more general level, there is also a need to differentiate between doing ethical things and doing things ethically , to understand and to make pedagogical choices that are ethical, and to account for the ever-present possibility of unintended consequences.

To drive vehicles autonomously, controlling steer angle, gas hatch, and brakes needs to be learned. The behavioral cloning method is used to imitate humans’ driving behavior. We created a dataset of driving in different routes and conditions, and using the designed model, the output used for controlling the vehicle is obtained. In this paper, the learning of self-driving vehicles based on real driving behavior using deep neural network techniques (LSV-DNN) is proposed. We designed a convolutional network which uses the real driving data obtained through the vehicle’s camera and computer. The response of the driver during driving is recorded in different situations, and by converting the real driver’s driving video to images and transferring the data to an Excel file, obstacle detection is carried out with the best accuracy and speed using the Yolo algorithm version 3. This way, the network learns the response of the driver to obstacles in different locations and the network is trained with the Yolo algorithm version 3 and the output of obstacle detection. Then, it outputs the steer angle and amount of brake, gas, and vehicle acceleration. This study focuses on designing a convolutional network using behavioral cloning and motion planning of autonomous vehicle using a deep learning framework. Neural networks are effective systems for finding relationships between data, modeling, and predict new data or classify data. As a result Neural networks with input real data predict steer angle and speed for autonomous driving. The LSV-DNN is evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in Python and TensorFlow environment. We evaluated the network error using the loss function. The results confirmed that our scheme is capable of exhibiting high prediction accuracy (exceeding 92.93%). In addition, our proposed scheme has high speed (more than 64.41%), low FPR (less than 6.89%), and low FNR (less than 3.95%), in comparison with the other approaches currently being employed.

However, there are different techniques on how to match the behavior of a robot to a user’s preference. The robot can be adaptable so that a user can change the robot’s behavior to one’s need, or the robot can be adaptive and autonomously tries to match its behavior to the user’s preference. Both types might decrease the gap between a user’s preference and the actual system behavior. However, the Level of Automation (LoA) of the robot is different between both methods. Either the user controls the interaction, or the robot is in control. We present a study on the effects of different LoAs of a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) on a user’s evaluation of the system in an exercising scenario. We implemented an online preference learning system and a user-adaptable system. We conducted a between-subject design study ( adaptable robot vs.  adaptive robot) with 40 subjects and report our quantitative and qualitative results. The results show that users evaluate the adaptive robots as more competent, warm, and report a higher alliance. Moreover, this increased alliance is significantly mediated by the perceived competence of the system. This result provides empirical evidence for the relation between the LoA of a system, the user’s perceived competence of the system, and the perceived alliance with it.

However, what exactly is robotics research? From its inception, robotics has been an inherently interdisciplinary field, bringing together diverse domains such as engineering, cognitive science, computer science and, more recently, knowledge from social sciences and humanities. Previous research on interdisciplinarity shows that this mode of knowledge production is often driven by societal concerns and political choices. The politics of who gets to make these choices and on what terms is the focus of empirical research in this paper. Using a novel mixed-method approach combining bibliometrics, desk-based analysis and fieldwork, this article builds a narrative of interdisciplinarity at the UK’s largest public robotics lab, the Bristol Robotics Laboratory. This paper argues for the recognition of the plural ways of knowing interdisciplinarity. From citation analysis, through tracing of the emerging fields and disciplines, to, finally, the investigation of researchers’ experiences; each method contributes a distinct and complementary outlook on “what robotics is made of”. While bibliometrics allows visualising prominent disciplines and keywords, document analysis reveals influential and missing stakeholders. Meanwhile, fieldwork explores the logics underpinning robotics and identifies the capabilities necessary to perform the research. In doing so, the paper synthesises plural ways of locating politics in interdisciplinary research and provides recommendations for enabling “structural preparedness for interdisciplinarity”.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00737-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Nevertheless, a threat of a disinformation-based attack on critical infrastructure is often overlooked. Here, we consider urban traffic networks and focus on fake information that manipulates drivers’ decisions to create congestion at a city scale. Specifically, we consider two complementary scenarios, one where drivers are persuaded to move towards a given location, and another where they are persuaded to move away from it. We study the optimization problem faced by the adversary when choosing which streets to target to maximize disruption. We prove that finding an optimal solution is computationally intractable, implying that the adversary has no choice but to settle for suboptimal heuristics. We analyze one such heuristic, and compare the cases when targets are spread across the city of Chicago vs. concentrated in its business district. Surprisingly, the latter results in more far-reaching disruption, with its impact felt as far as 2 km from the closest target.

There are both potential advantages and disadvantages with such technology in advancing the interests of patients, with resultant ontological and epistemic concerns for physicians and patients relating to the instatiation of AI as a dependent, semi- or fully-autonomous agent in the encounter. The concept of libertarian paternalism potentially exercised by AI (and those who control it) has created challenges to conventional assessments of patient and physician autonomy. The unclear legal relationship between AI and its users cannot be settled presently, an progress in AI and its implementation in patient care will necessitate an iterative discourse to preserve humanitarian concerns in future models of care. This paper proposes that physicians should neither uncritically accept nor unreasonably resist developments in AI but must actively engage and contribute to the discourse, since AI will affect their roles and the nature of their work. One’s moral imaginative capacity must be engaged in the questions of beneficence, autonomy, and justice of AI and whether its integration in healthcare has the potential to augment or interfere with the ends of medical practice.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10080-1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the last few years, IoV technology has emerged as a global revolution, demonstrating considerable impact upon the transportation and automation industry, hence, the interest of the researchers bends towards the utility of the IoV technology which motivated us to present a comprehensive review. This paper, thus, collates recent findings along with some anticipated applications of IoV technologies for transportation. It brings to light the evolution of the IoV studies referred as models for transportation since its birth and aims to present a deep insightful review of various IoV technologies with their strengths and weaknesses. The reviewed literature is organized systematically to give a categorical overview of recent developments. This article also discusses the outstanding potentialities and challenges that exist in transportation from IoV perspective with the belief that these will have the capacity to be addressed in the near future.

Most such scenarios are too complex to tackle directly, and reduced-order modelling is used in order to create viable representations of the target systems. The simplified setting allows for the development of rigorous control theoretical approaches, but the propagation of their effects back up the hierarchy and into real-world systems remains a significant challenge. Using the canonical set-up of a liquid film falling down an inclined plane under the action of active feedback controls in the form of blowing and suction, we develop a multi-level modelling framework containing both analytical models and direct numerical simulations acting as an in silico experimental platform. Constructing strategies at the inexpensive lower levels in the hierarchy, we find that offline control transfer is not viable; however, analytically informed feedback strategies show excellent potential, even far beyond the anticipated range of applicability of the models. The detailed effects of the controls in terms of stability and treatment of nonlinearity are examined in detail in order to gain understanding of the information transfer inside the flows, which can aid transition towards other control-rich frameworks and applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06287-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In an attempt to prevent or mitigate network abnormalities while accommodating the cohesiveness among the involved entities, modeling their interrelations and incorporating their structural, content and temporal attributes, graph-based anomaly detection solutions have been repeatedly adopted. In this article we propose, a multi-agent system, with each agent implementing a Graph Neural Network, in order to exploit the collaborative and cooperative nature of intelligent agents for anomaly detection. To this end, against the propagating nature of cyber-attacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), we propose a distributed detection scheme, which aims to monitor efficiently the entire network infrastructure. To fulfill this task, we consider employing monitors on active network nodes such as IoT devices, SDN forwarders, Fog Nodes, achieving localization of anomaly detection, distribution of allocated resources such as the bandwidth and power consumption and higher accuracy results. In order to facilitate the training, testing and evaluation activities of the Graph Neural Network algorithm, we create simulated datasets of network flows of various normal and abnormal distributions, out of which we extract essential structural and content features to be passed to neighbouring agents.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12530-020-09347-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many of the definitions and classifications of the subject matter of these subfields, as found in the literature, are conflated, which I seek to rectify. In this essay, I infer that using the term ‘machine ethics’ is too broad and glosses over issues that the term computational ethics best describes. I show that the subject of inquiry of computational ethics is of great value and indeed is an important frontier in developing ethical artificial intelligence systems (AIS). I also show that computational is a distinct, often neglected field in the ethics of AI. In contrast to much of the literature, I argue that the appellation ‘machine ethics’ does not sufficiently capture the entire project of embedding ethics into AI/S, and hence the need for computational ethics. This essay is unique for two reasons; first, it offers a philosophical analysis of the subject of computational ethics that is not found in the literature.

Globally, there are different rules and operating procedures in the supply chain network. These regulations are used for end-to-end tracking between industries of different countries. The major problem faced today is asset traceability, and it is addressed with the usage of Blockchain technology. Greater asset traceability is provided using this technology. Throughout this research study, we suggest a commodity traceability network focused on blockchain technologies, which permanently stores all commodity history in a global database by way of smart contracts and creates a chain that can trace back to the source of goods. In particular, we built an incident response system to check the parties’ identity and ensure the legitimacy of the transaction. And all events are stored permanently in the form of logs to manage disputes and track accountable entities. Also, a device prototype is designed utilizing truffle research nets. Initially, a user login form is developed to make a part of the Blockchain, followed with a function to add an entry of the stock-keeping unit (SKU) into the Blockchain. The SKU is used for adding the product or item into the Blockchain, i.e., the product information is added like “Dairy Milk”, then one transaction is complete. The local languages like Urdu and Hindi are supported the SKU. All users of the retail network can be accessed the SKU “Id” of that product, and it can update the status of the product. So, the history of the product is saved in the block until the customer block in-network, and the customer can access it by using the QR scan code.

In the proposed method, targets and robots are considered as fixed objects and movable objects, respectively. For each target, a constant mass is assigned, which corresponds to its quality. The fixed objects (which refer to targets) apply a gravitational force to the movable objects (which are considered as robots) and change their positions in the feasible search space and therefore, the best target allocation of robots is determined by employing the law of gravity. In the proposed scenario, task allocation consists of assigning the robots to the found targets in a 2-D feasible area. The expected distribution is obtained from the targets’ qualities that are represented as scalar values. Decision-making is a distributed mechanism and robots choose their assignments, taking into account targets’ qualities and distances. Moreover, a control parameter is planned to make a remarkable balance between exploration and exploitation ability of the proposed algorithm. A self-adaptive mechanism is proposed to adjust the value of the exploration parameter automatically, aiming to maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation ability of robots. Furthermore, in order to decrease the time of reaching the target and accelerate computation, a selection memory is designed. In the experiments, we examine the scalability of the proposed method in terms of the number of robots and the number of targets and speed of algorithm to deliver robots to the desired targets with comparison to other competitors. The simulation results show the scalability of the algorithm, comparing the existing methods. Moreover, some non-parametric statistical tests are utilized to compare the results obtained in experiments.

As these objects become more complex and work within our societies in ways that affect our well-being, there is a growing demand for machine ethics—we want a guarantee that the various automata in our lives will behave in a way that minimizes the amount of harm they create. Though many technologies exist as moral artifacts (and perhaps moral agents), the development of a truly ethical AI system is highly contentious; theorists have proposed and critiqued countless possibilities for programming these agents to become ethical. Many of these arguments, however, presuppose the possibility that an artificially intelligent system can actually be ethical. In this essay, I will explore a potential path to AI ethics by considering the role of imagination in the deliberative process via the work of John Dewey and his interpreters, showcasing one form of reinforcement learning that mimics imaginative deliberation.

In this study, we propose a personalized attraction enhanced network learning for recommendation PAENL.

AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective? Methods Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. Results Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusions The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00577-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The recent pandemic exposes the shortcomings of traditional healthcare system, i.e., hospitals and clinics alone are not capable to cope with this situation. One of the major technology that aids contemporary healthcare solutions is the smart and connected wearables. The advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled these wearables to collect data on an unprecedented scale. These wearables gather context-oriented information related to our physical, behavioural and psychological health. The big data generated by wearables and other healthcare devices of IoT is a challenging task to manage that can negatively affect the inference process at the decision centres. Applying big data analytics for mining information, extracting knowledge and making predictions/inferences has recently attracted significant attention. Machine learning is another area of research that has successfully been applied to solve various networking problems such as routing, traffic engineering, resource allocation, and security. Recently, we have seen a surge in the application of ML-based techniques for the improvement of various IoT applications. Although, big data analytics and machine learning are extensively researched, there is a lack of study that exclusively focus on the evolution of ML-based techniques for big data analysis in the IoT healthcare sector. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the application of machine learning techniques for big data analysis in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, strength and weaknesses of existing techniques along with various research challenges are highlighted.

However, in many real-world scenarios rewards are sparse or delayed, motivating the need for discovering efficient exploration strategies. While intrinsically motivated agents hold promise of better local exploration, solving problems that require coordinated decisions over long-time horizons remains an open problem. We postulate that to discover such strategies, a DRL agent should be able to combine local and high-level exploration behaviors. To this end, we introduce the concept of fast and slow curiosity that aims to incentivize long-time horizon exploration. Our method decomposes the curiosity bonus into a fast reward that deals with local exploration and a slow reward that encourages global exploration. We formulate this bonus as the error in an agent’s ability to reconstruct the observations given their contexts. We further propose to dynamically weight local and high-level strategies by measuring state diversity. We evaluate our method on a variety of benchmark environments, including Minigrid, Super Mario Bros, and Atari games.

In this work, a new approach is proposed to overcome this problem, by using extended Kalman filter (EKF)—linear Kalman filter (LKF), in a cascaded form, to couple the GPS with INS. GPS raw data are fused with noisy Euler angles coming from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings, in order to produce more consistent and accurate real-time navigation information. The proposed algorithm is designed to run through three software threads simultaneously. The multi-thread processing provides better use of hardware resources and applies more efficient INS/GPS loosely coupled integration scheme compared to the conventional method. Two datasets are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed approach against the existing GPS/INS coupling techniques. The first set is synthetic data generated by MATLAB that represents a static vehicle at known coordinates. The second one is a real road test data collected in Ontario, Canada.

This paper addresses a gap in the waiting time literature by examining previously sparsely studied relationships between individual- and travel-related characteristics and attitudes toward waiting using a revealed preference dataset of Northern California commuters (N = 2617). Correlational analyses, followed by a trivariate seemingly unrelated regression equations model, are developed for three waiting attitudinal constructs: general tolerance toward waiting, and attitudes toward equipped and expected waiting. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, time use perceptions and preferences, personality traits, multitasking attitudes (polychronicity), commute preferences and expectations, and general attitudes (e.g. pro-technology) are all seen to have significant effects on waiting attitudes. As this survey was executed on commuters, it also facilitates a unique simultaneous exploration of travel and wait time attributes, time uses that are often similarly viewed in day-to-day life. From this perspective, we see that longer commute times and distances are correlated with negative attitudes toward waiting, while commuters with pro-transit, pro-density, and pro-active transportation attitudes tend to have positive attitudes toward waiting. Additionally, we see that those with preferences for multitasking in general or at their jobs can tolerate waiting better. Overall, this study constitutes a distinctive contribution to the waiting time literature, capitalizing on a rich dataset to make important connections between related time uses and a multitude of other variables—key among them polychronicity, with its potential ability to reduce the negative perception and experience of waiting. Findings from this study may also benefit transportation and other service providers by facilitating an understanding of how various consumer groups/demographics view waiting, thus enabling providers to better cater to diverse needs/populations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-019-10054-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data because acquiring data involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming. This has triggered a serious debate in both the industrial and academic communities calling for more data-efficient models that harness the power of artificial learners while achieving good results with less training data and in particular less human supervision. In light of this debate, this work investigates the issue of algorithms’ data hungriness. First, it surveys the issue from different perspectives. Then, it presents a comprehensive review of existing data-efficient methods and systematizes them into four categories. Specifically, the survey covers solution strategies that handle data-efficiency by (i) using non-supervised algorithms that are, by nature, more data-efficient, by (ii) creating artificially more data, by (iii) transferring knowledge from rich-data domains into poor-data domains, or by (iv) altering data-hungry algorithms to reduce their dependency upon the amount of samples, in a way they can perform well in small samples regime. Each strategy is extensively reviewed and discussed. In addition, the emphasis is put on how the four strategies interplay with each other in order to motivate exploration of more robust and data-efficient algorithms. Finally, the survey delineates the limitations, discusses research challenges, and suggests future opportunities to advance the research on data-efficiency in machine learning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00419-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. Under these conditions, deep learning algorithms can be fully integrated into robotic systems only if a measure of prediction uncertainty is available. Prediction uncertainty in deep neural networks generally derives from two sources: data uncertainty and model uncertainty. The former arises because of noise in the data, usually caused by the sensors’ imperfections. The latter instead is generated from unbalances in the training data distribution. The article describes the developing fully autonomous vehicles at three levels, namely, perception, planning and control. Ideas from artificial intelligence have also been used to solve planning problems for autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have to deal with dynamic, non-stationary- and highly unpredictable operational environments. For the right understanding of this process, is described the best-known control strategies, map representation techniques, interaction with external systems, including pedestrian interactions under an informational conception of Internet of Things and Big Data Uncertainty and Uncertainty in Machine Learning, The article shows an analysis of the most promissory methods for treating the deep leaning uncertainty: Bayesian Deep Learning, which is an intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability approaches and the Fuzzy logic machine learning, in an Internet of Things framework. For the validation of theoretical explanations, it was proposed some simulations tools for visualizing and interpreting the uncertainty in the previously mentioned models and in the internet of things framework in different environments, useful for teaching and research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77939-9_6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With the rapid advancements in the field, CPS is being employed in healthcare, grid control systems, autonomous vehicles, and much more. The fairly new technologies used and areas of its application make it a favorable target to be exploited. The outcome of leaving its vulnerabilities unchecked can be detrimental and henceforth demands efficient ways to establish security. A vast and ever-changing system like CPS demands a modern solution to tackle the problem of establishing security and that is what brings machine learning (ML) based methods into the picture. This chapter begins with an introduction towards ML and explains the motivation towards using ML-based methods to establish security. The chapter having made the reader familiar with the key terms of ML will then go on to talk about their applications in fostering security for CPS. This will be done in two phases of classification, where firstly we will discuss ML methods from the perspective of the security domain they aim to tackle, i.e. methods of thread monitoring, mitigation techniques, etc. Then we will talk about ML security based on the architecture of CPS and explain where various methods sit inside the whole architecture, consisting of the application, communication, and the physical layers.

However, in OECD-Europe, transportation still represents the biggest source of carbon emissions, contributing by about 25% to the total CO 2 emissions, with cars and vans representing more than two-thirds of this share. The situation is even more alarming in non-OECD countries, where the transportation energy demand is expected to rise by 64% until 2040. The shift that we are witnessing toward the adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is going to be perhaps the most disruptive since the early days of automobiles and could revolutionize movement of people and goods. This level of connectivity and autonomy will transform transportation in several dimensions with important societal and economic impacts: improved safety, increased comfort, time saving potential, and more efficient road utilization are among the most widely discussed positive impacts of CAVs. However, the potential energy efficiency benefits of these technologies remain uncertain. From a single-vehicle efficiency perspective, research suggests that lightweight, low-speed, autonomous vehicles have the potential to achieve fuel economy an order of magnitude higher than current cars. Yet, at system-wide level, current estimates suggest that the total energy consumption impacts can range from a 90% decrease to a 200% increase in fuel consumption as compared to a projected 2050 baseline energy consumption. The paradigm that traffic congestion mitigation should reduce CO 2 emissions is yet to be proved. Therefore, interest in transportation regulation problems with explicit environmental considerations is growing. This work takes a more in-depth look at increased opportunities for energy-efficient driving with energy-oriented traffic management and CAVs deployment. In particular, the focus will be put on the road traffic control strategies in urban networks using connectivity to enable variable speed limits and traffic light adaptive control, as well as the energy-saving opportunities that arise for individual CAVs by anticipating future road geometry, traffic conditions, and interactions with neighboring vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_128-1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Today, these gadgets are often mobile devices, but in the advent of smart cities, more and more infrastructure—such as traffic and buildings—in our surroundings becomes intelligent. The intelligence, however, does not emerge by itself. Instead, we need both design techniques to create intelligent systems, as well as approaches to validate their correct behavior. An example of intelligent systems that could benefit smart cities are self-driving vehicles. Self-driving vehicles are continuously becoming both commercially available and common on roads. Accidents involving self-driving vehicles, however, have raised concerns about their reliability. Due to these concerns, the safety of self-driving vehicles should be thoroughly tested before they can be released into traffic. To ensure that self-driving vehicles encounter all possible scenarios, several millions of hours of testing must be carried out; therefore, testing self-driving vehicles in the real world is impractical. There is also the issue that testing self-driving vehicles directly in the traffic poses a potential safety hazard to human drivers. To tackle this challenge, validation frameworks for testing self-driving vehicles in simulated scenarios are being developed by academia and industry. In this chapter, we briefly introduce self-driving vehicles and give an overview of validation frameworks for testing them in a simulated environment. We conclude by discussing what an ideal validation framework at the state of the art should be and what could benefit validation frameworks for self-driving vehicles in the future.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60922-1_10,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

AVs can introduce safety risks arising from technical issues in the AV system and ethical issues in their design and deployment. In addition, socio-economic equity is a key aspect of sustainability, which can be undermined by AVs displacing jobs in existing industries, as well as by their discriminatory driving decisions shaped by algorithmic biases and the value-laden design choices of AV stakeholders.

However, their reliance on wireless communication channels makes such systems susceptible to a range of cyber-attacks. An intelligent adversary could target the platoon through message falsification between vehicles to carry out high-impact attacks. This would create persistent degradation of platoon stability or even cause catastrophic collisions. In this paper, we present a novel, end-to-end attack detection and mitigation framework. We use a deep neural network as an example anomaly detector tuned to reduce false alarm rate. We then model the interactions between the imperfect detector, the intelligent adversary and the defense system as a non-cooperative security game with imperfect information. In this setting, the adversary performs a test-time boiling frog attack against the detector. The Nash-equilibrium solution considers the downstream effects of the test-time attack, to guide the control system reconfiguration for the vehicles to mitigate communication-based attacks. The simulations conducted in a sophisticated simulator demonstrate the potential for real-world online deployment in a distributed manner. Results show that our approach outperforms baseline methods by up to $$30\%$$ 30 % in terms of increase of defense utilities, leading up to $$176\%$$ 176 % increase in minimum inter-vehicle distances for collision avoidance under attacks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86514-6_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the algorithm deployment of algorithms like DNNs still faces several challenges: one is the data volume, another is data privacy. What role should the edge play to support CAVs applications? In this chapter, we introduce two cloud-edge collaboration systems to support CAVs applications. One is CLONE, which is a collaborative learning setting on the edges (CLONE) which is able to mainly demonstrate the effectiveness of latency reduction and privacy-preserving. The other is pBEAM, which is a collaborative cloud-edge computation system for personalized driving behavior modeling.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81564-6_3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These Cooperating Cyber-Physical Systems (Co-CPS) impose an unprecedented integration between communication, sensing, and actuation actions, alongside the impact of the particular characteristics of the vehicle dynamics and the environment. This significantly increases the complexity of these systems, which, due to their critical safety requirements, must undergo extensive testing and validation to delimit the optimal safety bounds. In this chapter, we present CopaDrive, a cooperative driving framework that uses ROS as an enabler and integrator, to support the development and test of cooperative driving systems in a continuous fashion. CopaDrive integrates a physical simulator (Gazebo) with a traffic generator (Sumo) and a network simulator (OmNet++) to analyze a cooperative driving system. An On-board Unit (OBU) can also replace the network simulator, to create a Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulation and test the communications’ platforms and safety systems in a simulated scenario. Finally, the developed systems are integrated in the on-board computing platforms that will be deployed at the final prototype vehicles, and validated and demonstrated over a robotic testbed. CopaDrive enabled us to reuse software components and evaluate the cooperative driving system in each step of the development process. In this chapter, the framework’s performance and its potential is demonstrated for each configuration, in line with the development of a cooperative driving system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75472-3_4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Decomposition of safety validation is one promising strategy for replacing blunt test mileage conducted by real world drives and can be applied in multiple dimensions: shifting to a scenario-based testing process, assuring safety of individual subsystems as well as combining different validation methods. In this paper, we facilitate such a decomposed safety validation strategy by simulation-based elicitation of accuracy requirements for the environmental perception for a given planning function in a defined urban scenario. Our contribution is threefold: a methodology based on exploring perceptual inaccuracy spaces and identifying safety envelopes, perceptual error models to construct such inaccuracy spaces, and an exemplary application that utilizes the proposed methodology in a simulation-based test process. In a case study, we elicit quantitative perception requirements for a prototypical planning function, which has been deployed for real test drives in the city of Hamburg, Germany. We consider requirements regarding tracking and the position of an oncoming vehicle in a concrete scenario.

One promising technology for smart environment monitoring is the radar-based moving object tracking and classification. Radar-based technology is known to provide better solutions compared to vision-based systems as the latter is prone to the adverse effects of lighting and weather conditions. Radars operating in mm-wave range are preferred due to small size, good angular resolution, small apertures, and low cost. The signature waveform received from the moving object is used to estimate the range and the velocity of multiple targets based on Doppler drift. Also, the micro-Doppler effect on the return signal that occurs due to the micromotion dynamics such as vibrations or rotations can be used to identify the specific type of the target. This book chapter provides an overview of different types of radars and their respective signal processing aspects used for detecting the human and animal activity.

Autonomous vehicles are not only hardware products, but also a system of multi-sensor perception modules and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) software. There are many methods to test traditional software. However, finding a good enough software testing method for vehicles on-board DNNs models is still an open problem. In this paper, we provide a testing method based on boundary value testing. For DNNs, many studies have shown that adversarial examples can disable DNNs, and they are often closed to the decision boundary. Therefore, adversarial examples can be used as test cases. To accomplish this task, we use two novel algorithms to design boundary value test cases: a white-box method based on gradient information and a black-box method using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Further, we propose a whole testing procedure, including a computer simulation test, sensor unit test and real vehicle test.

The term Internet of Things is coined from two phrases such as Internet and Thing which states that the physical objects such as computing devices acts through the network of connection. This technological ecosystem allows the object or thing to collect and transfer the data through the internet, without any physical assistance. It includes four major processes such as collect, communicate, analyse and act. The main purpose of IoT is making the human life smart thereby reducing the human effort. The cloud is an environment that seems to be a reinforcement of booming technology. It provides everything as service, right from storage to computing power through internet. It seems to be a flexible computing model that has intensified the growth of information technology. It enchanted the sprout of IoT as it needs more storage for the data that are acquired from the objects. Another booming technology is artificial intelligence where the intelligence of machine is used for enabling smart tasks than using the human intelligence. It is in existence since 1950 s but the resurgence of it happens during twenty-first century with the advances in computing power and storage of voluminous data. The main purpose of AI is to achieve accurate interpretation of voluminous data and extract valuable learning from the data thereby achieving the appropriate goals in a flexible manner. The IoT with this gleaming AI allows the physical objects to collect the valuable data through continuous streaming and allows it to perceive its tasks and domains for greatest chance of prosperous goal achievement. Blockchain is another revolution of the information technology. The blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology is a promising technology where the digital assets of myriad users are managed by maintaining the transparency and evading the undesirable alterations. It stores and manages the data in the form of multiple blocks with respective cryptographic hashing. It is a distributed and decentralized model where the digital form of transactions are recorded in multiple devices, this allows the system to do any alterations or changes in each and every blocks so as to make changes in the record. This model avoids the precarious changes that may occur in the digital world. The IoT with this blockchain technology or the blockchain of thing may allow the digital environment to create a permanent, verifiable and secure method of managing the valuable data through intelligent machines. It will enable humanless interventions for decision making through proper environment interactions. This chapter elaborates all the four technologies such as IoT, AI, Cloud and Blockchain with regard to the autonomous vehicles.

The benefits of autonomous driving are numerous, including improving road traffic safety, reducing traffic-related economic loss, reducing traffic congestion, and enabling new vehicle applications. With the recent development of deep learning and sensor technologies, the autonomous vehicle becomes a highly complex networked system that heavily relies on sensor data to perceive the surrounding environment and make the correct decision. Such a system inevitably exposes a large attack surface and multiple attacks have been developed. It is thus crucial to protect the data and use secured machine learning algorithms to prevent, detect, and mitigate these attacks while keeping the autonomous driving system low-cost, low-latency, high-accuracy, and high-reliability.

Also, appropriate traffic control algorithms need to be developed before they can be fully implemented and integrated into the traffic environment. To do so, such mixed traffic flows must be simulated in various traffic scenarios. Traffic flow simulators paired with communication network simulators are commonly used to perform multiple simulations of such traffic flows. In this paper, three often used traffic simulators VISSIM, AIMSUN, and SUMO paired with network simulators NS-3 and OMNET++ with their features to model AVs and CAVs in a simulation environment are analyzed.

However, given that CAV are connected to internet, they face a principal challenge to ensure security, safety and confidentiality. It is highly valuable to provide a real-time and proactive anomaly detection approach for Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) exchanged data since such an approach helps to trigger prompt countermeasures to be undertaken allowing the damage avoidance. Recent machine learning methods show great efficiency, especially due to their capacity to handle nonlinear problems. However, an accurate anomaly detection in a space–time series is a challenging problem because of the heterogeneity of space–time data and the spatio-temporal correlations. An anomalous behavior can be seen as normal in different context. Thus, using one deep learning model to classify the observations into normal and abnormal or to identify the type of the anomaly is usually not efficient for large high-dimensional multi-variate time-series datasets. In this paper, we propose a stepwise method in which the time-series data are clustered on spatio-temporal clusters using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) auto-encoder for dimension reduction and Grey Wolf Optimizer based clustering. Then, the anomaly detection is performed on each cluster apart using a hybrid method consisting of Auto-Encoder for feature extraction and Convolution Neural Network for classification.

The current UAS state-of-the-art still depends on a remote human controller with robust wireless links to perform several of these applications. The lack of autonomy restricts the domains of application and tasks for which a UAS can be deployed. This is even more relevant in tactical and rescue scenarios where the UAS needs to operate in a harsh operating environment with unreliable wireless links. Enabling autonomy and intelligence to the UAS will help overcome this hurdle and expand its use improving safety and efficiency. The exponential increase in computing resources and the availability of large amount of data in this digital era has led to the resurgence of machine learning from its last winter. Therefore, in this chapter, we discuss how some of the advances in machine learning, specifically deep learning and reinforcement learning can be leveraged to develop next-generation autonomous UAS. We first begin motivating this chapter by discussing the application, challenges, and opportunities of the current UAS in the introductory section. We then provide an overview of some of the key deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques discussed throughout this chapter.

Accordingly, we discuss how deep learning approaches have been used to accomplish some of the basic tasks that contribute to providing UAS autonomy. Then we discuss how reinforcement learning is explored for using this information to provide autonomous control and navigation for UAS. Next, we provide the reader with directions to choose appropriate simulation suites and hardware platforms that will help to rapidly prototype novel machine learning based solutions for UAS.

Although, there is a plethora of studies in the literature evaluating various technologies, most of the models of technology acceptance and theories selected are applied on barriers of successful IT implementation in organisations or generally on technologies that have long been deployed. There are very few studies conducted on disruptive technologies such as AV. In this paper, this issue has been addressed with the identification of context-related constructs partly retrieved from existing literature, that describe a modelling process for a technology acceptance attempting to explain the main factors influencing people behavioural intention to adopt autonomous vehicle technology. Constructs such as trust, self-efficacy, anxiety, perceived safety and legal regulation have been considered. The main contribution of the study is the detailed exploration on the users’ acceptance of AV. We propose a theoretical model called Autonomous Vehicle Technology Acceptance Model (AVTAM) that gives us a better understanding of what will eventually influence future AV customers.

For centuries this quest has included the aspiration of creating artificial intelligent assistants, either embodied in physical objects or existing as mere software elements whose achievements have both advanced and challenged our perception of the notion of intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are no longer distant, detached research efforts but have become part of our everyday objects and experiences which are contributing to shape our professional, social and personal environments cultivating the technology enabled collective intelligence. Through this chapter we aim to explore the structure of technologies and product categories that constitute the ever dynamic and thriving AI landscape and their impacts in technician engagement through enhanced collaborative competencies. Specifically, AI technologies contributed to shape trends related with NDE competencies such as: 1. An unsatisfied demand of highly specialized NDE technicians in specific niches that runs parallel with the irruption and democratization of NDE technologies contained in direct-to-consumer products. 2. An increased bi-directional permeability of NDE and Digital competencies in the workplace. 3. Aging workforces decline amidst increased inspection demand aging-out of skilled craft and challenge in backfilling with current generational mindsets.

The heterogeneity observed in the generated data from each device has further contributed to latency delays and network traffic concerns. An integral part of current network research encompasses the monitoring of network activities, device identification, and secure exchange of information between different devices. The recognition and administration of these persistently increasing IoT devices have posed major challenges in various fields of their application, like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Hence, the management of network traffic flow between these devices has become a concerning issue. The prolonged inconsistency in cybersecurity systems and constrained computational capabilities have further made IoT devices more vulnerable to adversarial threats. To this end, the preservation and administration of network activities become crucial to manage. In this chapter, we address the network traffic administration issue for different IoT devices. We focus on the efficient characterization of inter-arrival rates of data generated from IoT devices for packet-level and flow-level analysis. Thus, making identification and management of IoT devices exceedingly significant for securing stable functioning of network activities. We also discuss some influential works conjectured to IoT devices and network analysis. The empirical results obtained from real-world network flows have been reported to provide a precise understanding of our observations.

In this chapter, we argue that demonstrable trustworthiness can be achieved by design, through transparency and by rigorous verification and validation. We then concentrate on ensuring correctness during system development, with specific focus on how to achieve implementations that are free from runtime errors and how design flaws can be detected prior to implementation. Our discussion is illustrated on two examples, robot navigation code and Simulink controllers. In both cases, the power of fully automatic theorem proving combined with test-based techniques can deliver strong confidence in system correctness. Attention is then turned to simulation-based verification, focusing in particular on the test generation challenge. We motivate the benefits of introducing agency into the test environment and show how exploiting multi-agent systems for test generation can lead to robust tests that achieve a high level of coverage as part of a coverage-driven verification methodology.

This article addresses this gap by identifying seven ethical factors that are essential for future AI4SG initiatives. The analysis is supported by 27 case examples of AI4SG projects. Some of these factors are almost entirely novel to AI, while the significance of other factors is heightened by the use of AI.

This tool recommends specific allocation mechanisms that match the authority’s objectives and preferences to solve allocation problems for particular contextual scenarios.

Additionally, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators are widely deployed in various neural network (NN) applications, including image recognition for autonomous vehicles and natural language processing, among others. Since training a powerful network requires expensive data collection and computing power, its design and parameters are often considered a secret intellectual property of their manufacturers. However, hardware accelerators can leak crucial information about the secret neural network designs through side-channels, like Electro-Magnetic (EM) emanations, power consumption, or timing. We propose and evaluate non-invasive and passive reverse engineering methods to recover NN designs deployed on GPUs through EM side-channel analysis. We employ a well-known technique of simple EM analysis and timing analysis of NN layers execution. We consider commonly used NN architectures, namely Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks.

This is used for pursuing higher studies, getting jobs, rewarding a person, etc. Nowadays, it is evident that admission forgery happens by producing fake certificates very frequently. Hence, verification of certificates becomes highly essential to overcome the issue of fake certification. Blockchain is a technology that provides solution to this problem. Blockchain enables peer-to-peer transfer of assets without any intermediaries. This chapter presents a framework for blockchain-enabled certificate verification system using robotics technology. Here, in this system, robotic cameras are being used to scan the certificates and store them on cloud using Arduino Uno connected to a WiFi device. Later on, the same has been stored permanently on blockchain in the form of blocks. Since the smart contract is computational component of the technology, hence, the chapter depicts a smart contract for storing of a certificate in blockchain and verifying it. The smart contract has been written as well as tested for its proper functioning, and the objectives had been achieved. Two softwares Sublime Text3 and Remix Ethereum IDE were used for writing and testing of the smart contract, respectively. This smart contract enables the employer to check the stored certificate which eases the task of verifying the job seeker’s certificates. This smart contract can be taken by students, employers as well as educational institutes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-0598-7_10,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Moreover, autonomous robots embed onboard deliberation functions. This is what makes them autonomous but open for new challenges. There are many approaches to consider for the V&V of AR software, e.g. write high-level specifications and derive them through correct implementation, deploy and develop new or modified V&V formalisms to program robotics components, etc. One should note that learned models aside, most models used in deliberation functions are already amenable to formal V&V. Thus, we rather focus on functional-level components or modules and propose an approach that relies on an existing robotics specification and implementation framework (Gen oM), in which we harness existing well-known formal V&V frameworks (UPPAAL, BIP, FIACRE-TINA). Gen oM was originally developed by roboticists and software engineers who wanted to clearly and precisely specify how a reusable, portable, middleware-independent, functional component should be specified and implemented. As a result, Gen oM has a rigorous specification and a clear semantics of the implementation, and it provides a template mechanism to synthesize code that opens the door to automatic formal-model synthesis and formal V&V (offline and online). This bottom-up approach, which starts from components implementation, is more modest than top-down ones which aim at a larger and more global view of the problem. Yet, it gives encouraging results on real implementations on which one can build more complex high-level properties to be then verified and validated offline but also with online monitors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66494-7_8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is helpful to improve the efficiency of urban transportation by controlling the traffic signal intelligently. Recently, various deep reinforcement learning methods have been proposed to solve TSC. However, most of these methods ignore the fusion of spatial and temporal features in traffic roadnets. Besides, these methods pay no attention to the correlations of the intersections in several local areas. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method with spatio-temporal feature fusion to solve TSC. The proposed method firstly calculates the correlations among different time steps to capture their temporal dependencies. Secondly, the proposed method constructs connected subnetworks to capture interactive relations among intersections in the subnetwork.

What underlies TML opportunities is the belief that fast data will require fast machine learning for fast decision-making. Given that fast data is here to stay and will only grow in pervasiveness, it presents an opportunity for organizations to harness it and use it to add more value to their business. It is imperative that you understand the use cases and the evolution of transactional machine learning and its differences from conventional machine learning. Advantages will accrue to organizations that evaluate and build transactional machine learning capabilities earlier than their peers. To achieve this, you must automate the machine learning process together with using data streams that are real time and event-driven.

Research Track,10.1007/978-3-030-86520-7_35,Springer,1/1/2021,"As RL algorithms have grown more powerful and sophisticated, they show promise for several practical applications in the real world. However, safety is a necessary prerequisite to deploying RL systems in real world domains such as autonomous vehicles or cooperative robotics. Safe RL problems are often formulated as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). In particular, solving CMDPs becomes challenging when safety must be ensured in rare, dangerous situations in stochastic environments. In this paper, we propose an approach for CMDPs where we have access to a generative model (e.g. a simulator) that can preferentially sample rare, dangerous events. In particular, our approach, termed the RP algorithm decomposes the CMDP into a pair of MDPs which we term a reconnaissance MDP (R-MDP) and a planning MDP (P-MDP). In the R-MDP, we leverage the generative model to preferentially sample rare, dangerous events and train a threat function , the Q-function analog of danger that can determine the safety level of a given state-action pair. In the P-MDP, we train a reward-seeking policy while using the trained threat function to ensure that the agent considers only safe actions. We show that our approach, termed the RP algorithm enjoys several useful theoretical properties. Moreover, we present an approximate version of the RP algorithm that can significantly reduce the difficulty of solving the R-MDP. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method over classical approaches in multiple tasks, including a collision-free navigation task with dynamic obstacles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86520-7_35,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm that is widely used in autonomous robotics, since their principles are very similar. Reinforcement learning is based on how humans and animals perceive, reason and act on their environments by trial-and-error, learning which actions are better and which are worse depending on the reward they produce. Likewise, robots interact with their environments using their sensors to perceive and their actuators, motors and end effectors to actuate. The main drawback of reinforcement learning is the steep computational cost in processes that involve large state and action spaces. However, this problem has been mitigated by the use of deep learning, which has proved to be an outstanding solution by automatically discovering relevant features and representations in raw and high-dimensional data. This combination results in a new paradigm known as deep reinforcement learning, that has been successfully employed in robotic tasks such as navigation and manipulation. Developments in robotics have enabled the presence of robots in increasingly dynamic, unpredictable, unstructured and partially observable environments, wherein uncertainty is a key element that stems from the lack of information. Thus, the ability to cope with uncertainty is crucial for autonomous robots. However, this scarcity of information has been widely ignored in most robotics works for the sake of simplicity, leading to inaccurate, approximate and unsafe solutions. In order to improve the navigation as well as other robotic tasks and, therefore, the safety of the robot itself and all the objects and beings that surround it, more research is needed on the different approaches and methods for dealing with uncertain information.

In this paper, it is shown that adversarial examples that cause incorrect label prediction and spoofing can be generated by rotating the images. Due to the black-boxed nature of the API, a modular context-based pre-processing pipeline is proposed consisting of a ResNet50 model that predicts the angle by which the image must be rotated to correct its orientation. The pipeline successfully performs the correction whilst maintaining the image’s resolution and feeds it to the API which generates labels similar to the original correctly oriented image, and using a percentage error metric, the performance of the corrected images as compared to its rotated counterparts is found to be significantly higher. These observations imply that the API can benefit from such a pre-processing pipeline to increase robustness to rotational perturbances.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-6067-5_23,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Vehicles without human drivers Driver are often not allowed on public roads. Why did the legislator not simply take out the necessity of having a human driver from the road safety laws or the traffic laws? The cause lies in the technology of the autonomous vehicles. Neither the industry nor academia are able to fully portray the risks, or their absence, of the technology used in autonomous vehicles. To understand the technology in more depth, testing in complex, real life situations, is necessary. Public roads can offer that environment. Without knowing the risks and still faced with demands for testing, legislators did initially not favor hard law instruments to regulate testing on public roads. Soft law Soft law instruments existed in various formats. Yet, the more experience the legislators gained with the regulation of testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, more and more hard law instruments started to appear. These hard laws are either allowing the creation of a space to experiment or offering just a framework. Framework providing laws are often supplemented by lower level legislation or guidelines. No matter which approach is taken, the general tendency is that each of these instruments tends to be technology neutral and favor a permit system. In most systems the industry is involved in setting up the parameters of the testing.

Currently, FL techniques have been applied in some data-sensitive areas such as finance, insurance, and healthcare. Although FL has broad application scenarios, there are still some significant and fundamental challenges, one of which is the training on Not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. More concretely, the global model aggregation and collaboration of a massive number of participants on the Non-IID data remain an unsolved problem. We find that most of the model aggregation optimization algorithms in the literature suffer from significant accuracy loss in the Non-IID setting for FL . To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model aggregation algorithm terms FedSV , which dynamically updates global model aggregation weights according to each local participant’s contribution in each training round. Furthermore, to evaluate the participants’ contribution, we propose a quantization algorithm based on Local Federated Shapley Value , which dynamically computes the contribution by the properties of the participant. Extensive experiments on Non-IID data partition, such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST, demonstrate that our approach can improve accuracy during training compared with existing methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-93049-3_14,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles—the ‘what’ of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)—rather than on practices, the ‘how.’ Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community’s ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI.

One of the solutions to provide end to end low latency is the utilization of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in the network. MEC provides cloud advantages to users by setting up a small cloud server in the edge node (i.e. close to the end-user), which decreases the amount of latency in network connections, in this regard, service migration has required as users migrate to the new location. Optimal migration decisions are challenging because they depend on the cloud environment, or edge nodes belong to different orchestrators, and security issues in the migration process must also be resolved in order to prevent unreliable requests.

Evasion accuracy is typically assessed using aggregate evasion rate, and it is an open question whether aggregate evasion rate enables feature-level diagnosis on the effect of adversarial perturbations on evasive predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that harnesses explainable ML methods to guide high-fidelity assessment of ML evasion attacks. Our framework enables explanation-guided correlation analysis between pre-evasion perturbations and post-evasion explanations. Towards systematic assessment of ML evasion attacks, we propose and evaluate a novel suite of model-agnostic metrics for sample-level and dataset-level correlation analysis. Using malware and image classifiers, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse model architectures and complementary feature representations. Our explanation-guided correlation analysis reveals correlation gaps between adversarial samples and the corresponding perturbations performed on them. Using a case study on explanation-guided evasion, we show the broader usage of our methodology for assessing robustness of ML models .",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90019-9_11,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To address this management complexity, AI has been referred to as the most viable tool for organizations to navigate the range of complex issues linked with platform sharing and integration, due to its potential for developing agility in both large and small organizations. Research on 6G started only a couple of years ago, and so far, most of the research on 6G has been undertaken from a technical perspective, with some recent studies analyzing some of the regulatory and business dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work (conceptual or empirical) has specifically attempted to untangle the link between AI and organizational agility development in the specific context of 6G. Our chapter is in response to these clear gaps in the literature, where we aim to undertake an exploratory analysis of 6G’s potential for the development of organizational agility in the telecommunications industry. Moreover, it is a pioneering work that future business and management scholars can build on while analyzing 6G’s management and implications in micro and macro settings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-5572-2_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The ever-increasing necessity for food production and availability to meet the requirements of the growing population forms a strong backbone to these sustainable new methods. These also propose certain advantages over traditional agriculture such as requirement for less areas of land, immunity to climate changes, and easy access to urban landscapes altogether leading to an increase in quality. An apt example of such a method would be vertical farming, practiced in an indoor environment. The efficiency of these farms is augmented by automation and the use of robots. The work focuses on developing a modular automated setup prototype, with intended use in a vertical farm. It discusses the design and development of key systems, namely, a storage system with vertical levels for housing the plant modules, known as the Vertical Stack System (VSS). It also features certain mechanical elements that aid in a smooth transfer of these modules in and out. A mobile robot is also discussed in the work, developed to navigate the farm environment and transport the plant modules to and from the VSS. The robot’s behavior in a virtual and real world is presented through the use of a simulation model, developed using the kinematics of the mobile robot, and a computational model, developed using sensor feedback, respectively. The development of an ingenious system called the Stacker is also presented. The Stacker is present on-board the mobile robot that is principally responsible for the transfer of plant modules. Additional work is presented for incorporating automation into the setup, through a sensor setup for monitoring and reporting certain environment variables surrounding the plant and through an interconnected operation.

However, the anti-spoofing methods are faced with several challenges: the additional cost of anti-spoofing devices, the limited computation resource within the vehicles, the lack of abnormal data, and model bias. To solve these problems, a generative adversarial scheme based anti-spoofing method is proposed for digital twin vehicular networks. The scheme consists of two deep-learning models of the generator and the detector, which generates pseudo normal data and detects spoofing. The LSTM model is introduced as the generator model, which fabricate the abnormal data with the GNSS/CAN/IMU data from Comma2k19.

Such high range of communication expressed by the smart vehicles makes many existing tasks easier to the vehicle owners and also introduces new features to increase the ease of the vehicle usage for the owners. Further, this high degree of communications also paves road for security threats which makes the smart vehicles highly vulnerable to privacy attacks like location tracking, remote hijacking of the vehicle. Such security attacks on smart vehicles not only questions the security of the vehicle, it also has greater effects in the safety of the passengers. Also, it is obvious that smart vehicles do have lot of sensors, cameras, devices like GPS and others which produce huge volume of data to be sent to the drivers or to the other sensor or devices connected to it. Such data carries sensitive information that needs to be protected to avoid privacy breach. So security is very important in dealing with smart vehicles. Traditional security and privacy strategies used in smart vehicles are not efficient to meet the threats that the vehicles are fronting mainly because they follow centralized mechanism to extend the security. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that maintains a chain of blocks to provide security and privacy. Blockchain provides security from all dimensions, and hence, it is popular in crypto-currencies, smart contracts. Each communication is referred as transaction in blockchain technologies and the transaction will be broadcasted to all participating nodes of the transaction for the verification and once verified the transaction will be added as new block to already existing blocks. To overcome the drawbacks in the traditional automotive security, blockchain technologies can be implemented to meet the requirement for the automotive security and privacy. The blockchain is formed by chaining the time-stamped blocks one after the other and a block includes the hash of the previous block in the blockchain. Hence, any changes made in a block will be notified easily by propagating changes in the hash of the following blocks. This feature makes the blockchain a better technology for automotive security. Additionally, blockchain enables the user to have flexible public key system, which makes the tracking ability of the user a tough task and hence protects the privacy of the user. Moreover, blockchain has its own reasons, why it cannot be implemented readily in automotive industry. The reasons be like, delay in getting verifications from participating nodes, where vehicles cannot wait so long to make decisions if there is delay. Other reasons may include scalability issues when there are more nodes involved in a transaction and what if there is increase in the number of nodes. This chapter reveals about the utilization of blockchain in automotive security in automobile sectors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6858-3_10,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is considered a major and inexorable driving force of innovation and disruption that challenges private and public organizations equally. With all economic and societal sectors being affected, digital economy is very dynamic and increasingly competitive. It empowers new startup ventures – backed by many billion dollars of venture capital – to create novel value propositions by leveraging digital technologies. Their highly scalable, data-driven, and software-centric operating models increasingly collide with incumbent companies and poise an existential threat to their business. Just think about Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android smartphones, for example. Built on a consistent digital platform, both companies attracted ever-expanding ecosystems of third-party app developers that ultimately caused Nokia to tumble from a position of phone industry dominance into irrelevance. This story is threatening to repeat everywhere across the economy: The cloud computing services of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are challenging traditional software and hardware providers, the online marketplaces of Amazon and Alibaba are replacing traditional retailers and challenge companies like on-demand Walmart, and the video delivery services of Netflix and Hulu are about to disrupt traditional pay TV providers. Another very popular example is the online booking platforms Airbnb and Booking.com that leverage digital technologies to simplify booking and offer personalized and individually tailored travel experiences while disrupting the business of traditional hotel chains including Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt. In order to capture the benefits of digital technologies, established organizations – independently of whether they operate in the public or private sector – are forced to incorporate them into their own ecosystem to advance their product and service portfolios through an organizational change process that is commonly referred to as digital transformation. This process of technology adaptation is particularly challenging for companies that were – in contrast to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others – not “born digital” since those companies need to undergo far-reaching business transitions that may well overturn established job designs and internal business processes and require novel ways of thinking and collaboration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-6774-5_1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, cutting edge computer vision technology based on deep-learning approaches has been deployed with an extraordinary degree of success. The ability to extract semantic concepts from continuous processing of video stream in real-time has led to the investigation of such solutions to enhance the operational security of critical infrastructure against intruders. Despite the success of computer vision technologies validated in a laboratory environment, there still exists several challenges that limit the deployment of these solutions in operational environment. Addressing these challenges, the paper presents a framework that integrates three main computer vision technologies namely (i) person detection; (ii) person re-identification and (iii) face recognition to enhance the operational security of critical infrastructure perimeter. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the integration of key technical innovations that satisfies the operational requirements of critical infrastructure in using computer vision technologies. One such requirement relates to data privacy and citizen rights, following the implementation of General Data Protection Regulation across Europe for the successful adoption of video surveillance for infrastructure security. The video analytics solution proposed in the paper integrates privacy preserving technologies, high-level rule engine for threat identification and a knowledge model for escalating threat categorises to human operator. The various components of the proposed framework has been validated using commercially available graphical processing units for detecting intruders. The performance o the proposed framework has been evaluated in operational environments of the critical infrastructure.

While shepherding offers a technological concept that allows a human to operate a significantly larger number of autonomous systems that a human can handle in today’s environment, it is important to realise that a significant amount of accidents today are due to human error. The scalability promise that shepherding offers comes with possible challenges including those arising from the cognitive load imposed on human operators and the need to smoothly integrate the human, as a biological autonomous system, with the wider multi-agent autonomous system of future operating environments. In this chapter, we bring together the dimensions of this complex problem. We present carefully selected factors to cover human performance, especially for cognitively demanding tasks and situation awareness, and how these factors contribute to trust in the system. We then present the Human Factors Operating Picture (H-FOP), which offers a real-time situation awareness picture on human performance in this complex environment.

Autonomous driving computer vision systems are often based on regular cameras, stereo cameras or on Lidar technology. Recently developed AI methods are often used for object detection in image data. These learning-based methods require a large amount of training data, the quality of its outputs highly depend on the quality of this training data and they rarely achieve high frame rates. Lidar has a high reputation for safety applications. Yet it suffers from a high price and a low number of points to reason from. Image-based computer vision can derive information from a much greater amount of data. Stereo-cameras derive depth information from two images by the optical principle of parallax. This can be used to enrich the already safe lidar, to make a more reliable sensor system. Sensors in mobile applications are subject to orientation changes, movement and vibrations. These negatively influence the data sampling process and therefore need to be compensated for. Lidar and stereo cameras have other sensor effects like flying points, which need to be filtered. We propose a high-performance object segmentation system on Lidar point clouds fused with stereo camera point clouds. For short term motion and vibration compensation, we propose the use of a visual-inertial-sensor based virtual gimbal. Modern graphics processing units (GPU) are used for sensor filtering, point cloud fusion, voxelization and connected component segmentation to achieve the high framerate and low-latency necessary for use in a dynamic environment.

For example, high-level synthesis (HLS) tools allow software developers to convert C/C++ code to hardware modules or utilize pre-existing hardware libraries.

However, depending on the task, the available amount of data varies significantly. Particularly robotic systems usually rely on small amounts of data, as producing and annotating them is extremely robot and task specific (e.g. grasping) and therefore prohibitive. Recently, in order to address the aforementioned problem of small datasets in robotic vision, a common practice is to reuse features that are already learned by a CNN within a large-scale task and apply them to different small scale ones. This transfer of learning shows some promising results as an alternative, but nevertheless it can not be compared with the performance of a CNN that is specifically trained from the beginning for that specific task. Thus, many researchers turned to synthetic datasets for training, since they can be produced easily and cost effectively. The main issue of such datasets that already exist, is the lack of photorealism both in terms of background and lighting. Herein, we are proposing a framework for the generation of completely synthetic datasets that includes all types of data that state-of-the-art algorithms in object recognition, and tracking need for their training.

Moreover, data collection, classification and evaluation has been challenging due to vehicle manufacturers deploying proprietary encoding schemes for sensor communications. This paper proposes a method for vehicle network data collection and processing to provide naturalistic datasets for identifying different driving behaviours. Firstly, we provide a guide for the assembly of an Arduino Uno R3 with a Sparkfun CAN bus shield for connection to the on-board diagnostics (OBD) port to collect the vehicle data. Secondly, we offer baseline metrics for labelling passive and aggressive driving behaviours through the analysis of a vehicle’s CAN bus data. Finally, a state-of-the-art deep learning model that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures is implemented to evaluate the fitness of the data collected using the proposed method. The collected naturalistic dataset was used to train this model in-order to recognise driver behaviour patterns that are otherwise unobservable to humans and that can be used to identify passive and aggressive driver events. Our experiment shows a 0.98 F1 score, indicating our data collection method and metrics used for selecting features can provide quality datasets for intrusion detection against attacks mimicking aggressive driving.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-89432-0_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Following Avizienis et al.’s taxonomy for faults, human-made error can be characterized as the operator’s failure to deliver services while interacting with the interactive system. Non human-made errors are called natural faults and may occur during development or set the interactive system as well as its users into an error-state during its use. Focusing on interactive systems specificities, this paper presents a comprehensive description of faults covering both development and operation phases. In correspondence with this taxonomy, we present mechanisms to avoid, remove, tolerate and mitigate faults in order to design and develop what we call “perfect” interactive systems taking into account the organization, the interactive system, the environment and the people operating them.

Even if organizations have not been able to make the move to cloud so far, it is part of the near-term business goals for many. In the social context, the cloud has a significant effect on human interactions; we are also saving more and more of our personal (and confidential) data on the cloud. During the first global lockdown in March 2020, the uptake in social media increased dramatically. It is predicted that the ‘new normal’ will involve a continued use of social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram as well as conferencing tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. In fact, the cloud is seen to be more crucial to everyday life now more than ever before. While good from a revenue-generating perspective for cloud operators and service providers, this is a challenging situation to manage. The post-COVID-19 cloud represents a nexus of critical drivers including cyber-security, reliability, efficiency and cost that could transform the way the cloud and its associated technologies operate. In this chapter, we therefore examine the inter-relationships between these qualities, giving specific attention to the achievement of privacy and security. A proposal is made to extend the original CIA triad, which defines the priorities that should be given when integrating security into an organization, with a focus on the achievement of confidentiality, integrity and availability; with the achievement of these, we argue that there is an overall focus on reliability. The proposed extension, which forms eCIA, advocates that network reliability be achieved in parallel with efficiency. When considered together, in a planned approach that is not applied as a bolt-on reaction to a breach, there is a careful balance to reach in the parallel achievement of all objectives.

We propose a computationally efficient model for pedestrian behavior prediction on a short finite time horizon to ensure safety in automated driving. The model is based on a cellular automaton, working on an occupancy grid map and assumes a physical pedestrian capability constraint. It is enriched by a variable update rate with a mixed neighborhood, overcoming the limitations of vanilla cellular automata and coming closer to the results of state-of-the-art algorithms, while keeping the benefits of its straightforward parallelizability. The approach is evaluated on synthetic benchmarks outlining the general performance parameters as well as in an implementation on potential real-world situations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-92124-8_28,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, real-time constraints frequently limit the accuracy of online tests especially in scenarios where realistic robot-terrain interactions are complex to model. In this context, we propose a deep learning framework trained in an end-to-end fashion from elevation maps and trajectories to estimate the occurrence of failure events. The network is first trained and tested in simulation over synthetic maps generated by the OpenSimplex algorithm. The prediction performance of the Deep Learning framework is illustrated by being able to retain over $$94\%$$ 94 % recall of the original simulator at $$30\%$$ 30 % of the computational time. Finally, the network is transferred and tested on real elevation maps collected by the SEEKER consortium during the Martian rover test trial in the Atacama desert in Chile.

It is shown that the proposed partitioning method assigns a larger subgraph to a robot that has more resources or better capabilities compared to its neighbors. Next, a distributed deployment strategy is proposed to optimally distribute robots on the graph with the aim of monitoring specified regions of interest in the environment. It will be proved that the proposed combined partitioning and deployment strategy is an optimal solution in the sense that any other arbitrary partition than the proposed one results in a larger coverage cost, and that our deployment strategy also minimizes the considered cost.

Machine learning-based solutions have been already used as a tool to supersede signature-based anti-malware systems. However, malware authors leverage features from malicious and legitimate samples to estimate statistical difference in-order to create adversarial examples. Hence, to evaluate the vulnerability of machine learning algorithms in malware detection, we propose five different attack scenarios to perturb malicious applications (apps). By doing this, the classification algorithm inappropriately fits the discriminant function on the set of data points, eventually yielding a higher misclassification rate. Further, to distinguish the adversarial examples from benign samples, we propose two defense mechanisms to counter attacks. To validate our attacks and solutions, we test our model on three different benchmark datasets. We also test our methods using various classifier algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art data poisoning method using the Jacobian matrix. Promising results show that generated adversarial samples can evade detection with a very high probability. Additionally, evasive variants generated by our attack models when used to harden the developed anti-malware system improves the detection rate up to 50% when using the generative adversarial network (GAN) method.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-020-03083-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories.

Over the years, researchers and practitioners have proposed many auto-scaling solutions using versatile techniques ranging from simple if-then-else based rules to sophisticated optimisation, control theory and machine learning based methods. However, despite an extensive range of existing elasticity research, the aim of implementing an efficient scaling technique that satisfies the actual demands is still a challenge to achieve. The existing methods suffer from issues like: (1) the lack of adaptability and static scaling behaviour whilst considering completely fixed approaches; (2) the burden of additional computational overhead, the inability to cope with the sudden changes in the workload behaviour and the preference of adaptability over reliability at runtime whilst considering the fully dynamic approaches; and (3) the lack of considering uncertainty aspects while designing auto-scaling solutions. In this paper, we aim to address these issues using a holistic biologically-inspired feedback switch controller. This method utilises multiple controllers and a switching mechanism, implemented using fuzzy system, that realises the selection of suitable controller at runtime. The fuzzy system also facilitates the design of qualitative elasticity rules. Furthermore, to improve the possibility of avoiding the oscillatory behaviour (a problem commonly associated with switch methodologies), this paper integrates a biologically-inspired computational model of action selection. Lastly, we identify seven different kinds of real workload patterns and utilise them to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art approaches.

Most of the related studies focus on the solution to a single scenario or only guarantee safety without considering driving efficiency. To address these problems, this study proposed a deep reinforcement learning enabled decision-making framework for AVs to drive through intersections automatically, safely and efficiently. The mapping relationship between traffic images and vehicle operations was obtained by an end-to-end decision-making framework established by convolutional neural networks. Traffic images collected at two timesteps were used to calculate the relative velocity between vehicles. Markov decision process was employed to model the interaction between AVs and other vehicles, and the deep Q-network algorithm was utilized to obtain the optimal driving policy regarding safety and efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework, the top three accident-prone crossing path crash scenarios at intersections were simulated, when different initial vehicle states were adopted for better generalization capability.

Since 2016, deep learning techniques have been actively researched for tomographic imaging, especially in the context of biomedicine, with impressive results and great potential. Tomographic reconstruction produces images of multi-dimensional structures from externally measured ‘encoded’ data in the form of various tomographic transforms (integrals, harmonics, echoes and so on). In this Review, we provide a general background, highlight representative results with an emphasis on medical imaging, and discuss key issues that need to be addressed in this emerging field. In particular, tomographic imaging is an integral part of modern medicine, and will play a key role in personalized, preventive and precision medicine and make it intelligent, inexpensive and indiscriminate. The popularity of deep learning is leading to new areas in biomedical applications. Wang and colleagues summarize in this Review the recent development and future directions of deep neural networks for superior image quality in the tomographic imaging field.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42256-020-00273-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-020-2955-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This article takes social, cultural and philosophical approaches instead, critically appraising how human subjectivity, and human-machine relations, are shifting and changing through the application of big data and algorithmic techniques to the automation of driving. 20th century approaches to safety engineering and automation—be it in an airplane or automobile-have sought to either erase the human because she is error-prone and inefficient; have design compensate for the limits of the human; or at least mould human into machine through an assessment of the complementary competencies of each. The ‘irony of automation’ is an observation of the tensions emerging therein; for example, that the computationally superior and efficient machine actually needs human operators to ensure that it is working effectively; and that the human is inevitably held accountable for errors, even if the machine is more efficient or accurate. With the emergence of the autonomous vehicle (AV) as simultaneously AI/ ‘robot’, and automobile, and distributed, big data infrastructural platform, these beliefs about human and machine are dissolving into what I refer to as the ironies of autonomy . For example, recent AV crashes suggest that human operators cannot intervene in the statistical operations underlying automated decision-making in machine learning, but are expected to. And that while AVs promise ‘freedom’, human time, work, and bodies are threaded into, and surveilled by, data infrastructures, and re-shaped by its information flows. The shift that occurs is that human subjectivity has socio-economic and legal implications and is not about fixed attributes of human and machine fitting into each other. Drawing on Postphenomenological concepts of embodiment and instrumentation, and excerpts from fieldwork, this article argues that the emergence of AVs in society prompts a rethinking of the multiple relationalities that constitute humanity through machines.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-00646-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To address this pressing issue, this commentary proposes that the physical and digital infrastructures should be upgraded to take advantage of emerging technologies and facilitate the vehicle-infrastructure integration (VII), to better inform decision-makers at various levels. Driven by the paradigm shift towards more automation and more intelligent transportation, it is time to reimagine the vehicle-infrastructure ecosystem with the cold-climate issues in mind, and to enhance communications and coordination among various highway users and stakeholders. This commentary envisages the deployment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies to bring about transformative changes and substantial benefits in terms of enhanced winter safety and mobility on highways. At the center of the commentary is a conceptualized design of next-generation highways in cold climates, including the existing infrastructure entities that are appropriate for possible upgrade to connected infrastructure (CI) applications, to leverage the immensely expanded data availability fueled by better spatial and temporal coverage. The commentary also advances the idea that CI solutions can augment the sensing capabilities and confidence level of connected or autonomous vehicles. The application scenarios of VII system is then briefly explored, followed by some discussion of the paradigm shift towards V2X applications and a look to the future including some identified research needs in the arena of CI. This work aims to inspire dialogues and synergistic collaborations among various stakeholders of the VII revolution, because the specific challenges call for systematic, holistic, and multidisciplinary approaches accompanied by concerted efforts in the research, development, pilot testing, and deployment of CI technologies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s43065-020-00014-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The increasing adoption of MLSs in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance has fostered much attention towards the quality assurance of such systems. Despite the advances in software testing, MLSs bring novel and unprecedented challenges, since their behaviour is defined jointly by the code that implements them and the data used for training them. Objective: To identify the existing solutions for functional testing of MLSs, and classify them from three different perspectives: (1) the context of the problem they address, (2) their features, and (3) their empirical evaluation. To report demographic information about the ongoing research. To identify open challenges for future research. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study about testing techniques for MLSs driven by 33 research questions. We followed existing guidelines when defining our research protocol so as to increase the repeatability and reliability of our results. Results: We identified 70 relevant primary studies, mostly published in the last years. We identified 11 problems addressed in the literature. We investigated multiple aspects of the testing approaches, such as the used/proposed adequacy criteria, the algorithms for test input generation, and the test oracles. Conclusions: The most active research areas in MLS testing address automated scenario/input generation and test oracle creation.

The process of extracting driving patterns can be challenging due to issues such as the collection of valid data, clustering of population groups, and definition of similar behaviors. Naturalistic Driving methods provide a solution by allowing the collection of exhaustive datasets in quantitative and qualitative terms. However, exploiting and analyzing these datasets is complex and resource-intensive. Moreover, most of the previous studies, have constrained the great potential of naturalistic driving datasets to very specific situations, events, and/or road sections. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for extracting driving patterns from naturalistic driving data, even from small population samples. We use Geographic Information Systems (GIS), so we can evaluate drivers’ behavior and reactions to certain events or road sections, and compare across situations using different spatial scales. To that end, we analyze some kinematic parameters such as speeds, acceleration, braking, and other forces that define a driving attitude.

In contrast, animals such as rats and pigeons can perform goal-directed navigation with great reliability. Evidence from neural science and ethology suggests that various species represent the spatial space as a topological template, with which they can actively evaluate future navigation uncertainty and plan reliable/safe paths to distant goals. While topological navigation models have been deployed in mobile robots, relatively little inspiration has drawn upon biology in terms of topological mapping and active path planning. In this paper, we propose a novel bio-inspired topological navigation model, which consists of topological map construction, active path planning and path execution, for aerial mobile robots with visual landmark recognition and compass orientation capability. To mimic the topological spatial representation, the model firstly builds the topological nodes based on the reliability of visual landmarks, and constructs the edges based on the compass accuracy. Then a reward diffusion algorithm akin to animals’ path evaluation process is developed. The diffusion process takes the topological structure and landmark reliability into consideration, which helps the agent to construct the path with visually reliable nodes. In the path execution process, the agent combines orientation guidance and landmark recognition to estimate its position. To evaluate the performance of the proposed navigation model, a systematic series of experiments were conducted in a range of challenging and varied real-world visual environments. The results show that the proposed model generates animal-like navigation behaviours, which avoids travelling across large visually aliased areas, such as forest and water regions, and achieves higher localization accuracy than navigating on the shortest paths.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-020-01190-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is desirable to monitor user cognitive load in applications such as automation, robotics, and aerospace to achieve operational safety and to improve user experience. This can allow efficient workload management and can help to avoid or to reduce human error. However, tracking cognitive load in real time with high accuracy remains a challenge. Hence, we propose a framework to detect cognitive load by non-intrusively measuring physiological data from the eyes and heart. We exemplify and evaluate the framework where participants engage in a task that induces different levels of cognitive load. The framework uses a set of classifiers to accurately predict low, medium and high levels of cognitive load. The classifiers achieve high predictive accuracy. In particular, Random Forest and Naive Bayes performed best with accuracies of 91.66% and 85.83% respectively. Furthermore, we found that, while mean pupil diameter change for both right and left eye were the most prominent features, blinking rate also made a moderately important contribution to this highly accurate prediction of low, medium and high cognitive load.

However, the rapidly growing body of research in adversarial machine learning has demonstrated that the deep learning architectures are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Thus, the raises questions about the security of intelligent Internet of thing (IoT) and trust sensitive areas. This emphasizes the urgent need for practical defense technology that can be deployed to real-time combat attacks at any time. Well-crafted small perturbations lead to the misclassification of legitimate images by neural networks, but not the human visual system. It is worth noting that many attack strategies are designed to disrupt image pixels in a visually imperceptible manner. Therefore, we propose a new defense method and take full advantage of 5G high-speed bandwidth and mobile edge computing (MEC) effectively.

We present a formal verification technique for guaranteeing legal safety in arbitrary urban traffic situations. Legal safety means that autonomous vehicles never cause accidents although other traffic participants are allowed to perform any behaviour in accordance with traffic rules. Our technique serves as a safety layer for existing motion planning frameworks that provide intended trajectories for autonomous vehicles. We verify whether intended trajectories comply with legal safety and provide fallback solutions in safety-critical situations. The benefits of our verification technique are demonstrated in critical urban scenarios, which have been recorded in real traffic. The autonomous vehicle executed only safe trajectories, even when using an intended trajectory planner that was not aware of other traffic participants. Our results indicate that our online verification technique can drastically reduce the number of traffic accidents. Recent accidents with autonomous test vehicles have eroded trust in such self-driving cars. A shift in approach is required to ensure autonomous vehicles can never be the cause of accidents.

Here we examine the relationship between hardware platforms and the competency awareness of a neural network. We highlight the impact of two key areas of hardware development — increasing memory size of accelerator architectures and device-to-device variation in the emerging devices typically used in in-memory computing — on uncertainty estimation quality. We also consider the challenges that developments in uncertainty estimation methods impose on hardware designs. Finally, we explore the innovations required in terms of hardware, software, and hardware–software co-design in order to build future competency-aware neural networks. This Perspective examines the relationship between hardware platforms and the competency awareness of a neural network, highlighting how hardware developments can impact uncertainty estimation quality, and exploring the innovations required in order to build competency-aware neural networks in resource constrained hardware platforms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41928-020-00476-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

When the agents can only acquire partial observations and are faced with tasks requiring coordination and synchronisation skills, inter-agent communication plays an essential role. In this work, we propose a framework for multi-agent training using deep deterministic policy gradients that enables concurrent, end-to-end learning of an explicit communication protocol through a memory device. During training, the agents learn to perform read and write operations enabling them to infer a shared representation of the world. We empirically demonstrate that concurrent learning of the communication device and individual policies can improve inter-agent coordination and performance in small-scale systems. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in scenarios with up to six agents. We illustrate how different communication patterns can emerge on six different tasks of increasing complexity. Furthermore, we study the effects of corrupting the communication channel, provide a visualisation of the time-varying memory content as the underlying task is being solved and validate the building blocks of the proposed memory device through ablation studies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-019-05864-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It defends three propositions. First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify ‘true’ moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people’s moral beliefs. The final part of the paper explores three ways in which fair principles for AI alignment could potentially be identified.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The computing power and memory size are two important constraints of these devices. Recently, some architectures have been proposed to overcome these limitations by considering specific hardware-software equipment. In this paper, the lightweight residual densely connected blocks are proposed to guaranty the deep supervision, efficient gradient flow, and feature reuse abilities of convolutional neural network. The proposed method decreases the cost of training and inference processes without using any special hardware-software equipment by just reducing the number of parameters and computational operations while achieving a feasible accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is more efficient than the AlexNet and VGGNet in terms of model size, required parameters, and even accuracy. The proposed model has been evaluated on the ImageNet, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. It achieves state-of-the-art results on Fashion MNIST dataset and reasonable results on the others.

Some key points include the definition of the working environment, type of technique used to solve a particular type of problem, their subclassification and interdependencies with each other. It is also required to discuss in detail to understand and solve the problem of path planning in the right perspective. To do so, this paper presents the evolution of path planning algorithms of the last 5 decades, and then a broad classification of all those algorithms. After that, algorithms are categorized into different sections and has been discussed which are very often used in recent times to make the path planning approach more effective and efficient. This paper presents an extensive and elaborative survey of path planning algorithms and associated techniques for robots whose excellent contribution to the filed is invaluable. There are multiple issues related to the working environment of robots, whether it belongs to the two dimensional or three dimensional, static or dynamic, single robot or multi-robot, single objective/multi-objective and many more. This paper addresses all these issues in a detailed way. Another critical issue is related to the scope of algorithms which has been discussed at length in this paper like whether the algorithm is compatible for global/local path planning, it is Exact or heuristic in nature. This issue is systematically and hierarchically described to get a clear understanding of the problem domain. The effort is to bring an insight into the classification and evolution of path planning algorithms with its technical detail and discussions. The paper presents some emerging technologies which can be clubbed with robots to take it to another level. Cloud computing is one which is being extensively absorbed in many technologies. This paper discusses some cloud platforms like OpenStack and Google Cloud to deploy path planning applications for robots. This paper tries explicitly to conclude by testing path planning robots using Google cloud platform (using it as Infrastructure as a Service IaaS) citing its advantages and capability to expand its acceptability and assumes to be the future scope for robot path planning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41315-020-00129-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, we observe that the line of questioning has often not been examined critically and underlying conceptual problems not always dealt with at the root. In this paper, we investigate the nature of ethical AI systems and what their moral status might be by first turning to the notions of moral agency and patience. We find that their explication would come at a too high cost which is why we, second, articulate a different approach that avoids vague and ambiguous concepts or the problem of other minds.

Communication is not treated as a constraint but a mission goal. While achieving this goal, our aim is to avoid compromising the area coverage goal and the overall mission time. We define the mission tasks as: search, inform, and monitor at the best possible link quality. Building on our centralized simultaneous inform and connect (SIC) path planning strategy, we propose two adaptive strategies: (1) SIC with QoS (SICQ): optimizes search, inform, and monitor tasks simultaneously and (2) SIC following QoS (SIC+): first optimizes search and inform tasks together and then finds the optimum positions for monitoring. Both strategies utilize information as soon as it becomes available to determine UAV tasks. The strategies can be tuned to prioritize certain tasks in relation to others. We illustrate that more tasks can be performed in the given mission time by efficient incorporation of communication in the path design. We also observe that the quality of the resultant paths improves in terms of connectivity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-020-09926-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

USVs can work as edge computing devices to locally and cooperatively perform heavy computational tasks without dependence of remote cloud servers. As such, we organize a team of USVs to escort a high value ship (e.g., mother ship) in a complex maritime environment with hostile intruder ships, where the significant challenge is to learn cooperation of USVs and assign each USV tasks to achieve optimal performance. To this end, in this paper, a hierarchical scheme is proposed for the USV team to guard a valuable ship, which belongs to problems of sparse rewards and long-time horizons in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The core idea utilized in the proposed scheme is centralized training with decentralized execution, where USVs learn policies to guard a high-value ship with extra shared environmental data from other USVs through communication. Specifically, the ships are divided into two groups, i.e., high-level ship and low-level USVs. The high-level ship optimizes decision-level policy to predict intercept points, while each low-level USV utilizes multi-agent reinforcement learning to learn task-level policy to intercept intruders. The hierarchical task guidance is exploited in maritime escorting, whereby high-level ship’s decision-level policy guides the training and execution of task-level policies of USVs. Simulation results and experiment analysis show that the proposed hierarchical scheme can efficiently execute the escort mission.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-019-00857-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Self-adaptive systems are usually built of a managed part, which implements their functionality, and a managing part, which implements the self-adaptive mechanisms. Hence, the complexity of self-adaptive systems results also from the existence of the managing part and the interaction between the managed and the managing parts. The available evaluation approaches of self-adaptive systems focus on their performances, i.e., on the benefits (e.g., degree of autonomy, support for detecting anomalous behavior, adaptivity time, quality of response) achieved through the self-adaptive mechanisms of the managing part. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of the design of self-adaptive systems (including the managed and the managing parts) as it is done in traditional software engineering. We are interested in the internal software quality of self-adaptive systems, as the existence of the managing part and its interaction with the managed part leads to a tightly coupled system. We analyze the self-adaptive systems through the detection of different issues such as architectural and code smells and the detection of design patterns. The smells provide some hints on possible design and implementation problems, and help software engineers to improve the quality of the systems. While, design patterns are usually indicators of the application of good practices in the software development and allow to capture part of the design rationale. In this way, they can help software engineers to understand, reuse, and extend self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we have considered the detection of 3 architectural smells, 18 code smells, and 15 design patterns in 11 self-adaptive systems written in the Java programming language. The results indicate that the 3 architectural smells, 9 out of the 18 code smells, and the 15 design patterns have been detected in all the analyzed self-adaptive systems.

Thus, it is important to develop high-performance techniques to process and manipulate these images. On the other hand, image processing techniques are enhanced spatially based on neural networks. Deep learning is one of the most important techniques in use for computer vision tasks and has been deployed successfully to solve many tasks. But when dealing with remote sensing images, the deep learning method faces two main problems: the underfitting problem, because of the small amount of learning data and the unbalanced receptive field problem, because of the structural stereotype of the remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose to use a complex-valued neural network to segment high-resolution remote sensing images. The proposed network can deal with the problems of remote sensing images by using an ensemble of Complex-Valued Auto-Encoder. Based on an adaptive clustering technique, this network can be used to solve the multi-label segmentation problem of remote sensing images.

However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles—the ‘what’ of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)—rather than on practices, the ‘how.’ Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community’s ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI.

This emerging electricity generation elasticity could be used to optimize aggregator load profile by altering real-time demand of a power network, particularly in the premises of a massively EVs surrounded grid. In this paper, we have proposed a demand response algorithm to optimize vehicle to grid (V2G) aggregation, by enabling EVs scheduled charging/discharging, in quest to minimize the energy cost for the retailer, as well as satisfying the electricity market, i.e., day-ahead and instantaneous real-time markets. We have employed a decentralized approach in our proposed scheme, which is accessible, allows fast convergence, and assures consumers’ privacy. The simulation results show that our proposed technique significantly reduces the energy cost, explicitly for a retailer who tends to optimize the power network by penetrating an efficient algorithm. In addition, our algorithm shows more relevance when the grid leniently manages several intermittent energy generation resources. Practically the real-time load variations are uncertain, and are difficult to control, which increases the power and cost variations, and some time ends up as complete system failure. By using this algorithm the energy retailers can offer reliable service and suitable tariffs to consumers, to prove relevancy by restricting such constraints.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-020-04505-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Improved spatial information on reef geomorphic zonation and benthic cover type (including coral type) is critical to support scientific work to understand how the GBR is changing, and to support resource management decisions that enable conservation of the reef and its essential ecosystem services. Yet, no comprehensive maps exist that detail the geomorphic zonation or benthic cover for the GBR’s ~ 3000 reefs. This study presents three new types of shallow reef maps for 237 reefs in the central Cairns Management Region of the GBR Marine Park (GBRMP), explores how the detailed habitat maps created compared to current maps and posits how the new maps may support and refine current critical key science outputs and management challenges. Geomorphic Zonation , Benthic Cover and Coral Type habitat maps were created using a unique combined object-based image analysis and ecological modelling approach that incorporated satellite imagery, limited field data and key reef physical attributes (depth, slope, waves) using a previously peer-reviewed mapping approach developed for the Capricorn Bunker Group reefs, Southern GBR. The mapping approach was consistent and repeatable, suggesting applicability to mapping all 3000 reefs in the GBRMP. Compared to existing maps that only outline each reef, the increase in detail provided by these new habitat maps enabled discrete characterisation of each reef’s geomorphology and benthic composition. With the new habitat maps, areas within each reef can be identified as either coral habitat or not coral habitat. This has not been possible previously. As such, a model of coral ecological and biophysical processes that depends on bottom reflectance of sand and coral areas can be fine-tuned. Similarly, for reef restoration, nursery structures are commonly placed in non-coral habitats, and/or coral larvae are dispersed in areas of known coral habitat. The new habitat maps presented permit more accurate identification of these areas such that restoration projects can be targeted more effectively. These findings confirm the need to now apply this mapping approach to the full extent of the GBR.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01929-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, accurate inference of semantics requires measurement models that correctly capture properties of semantic detections such as viewpoint dependence, spatial correlations, and intra- and inter-class variations. Such models should also gracefully handle open-set conditions which may be encountered, keeping track of the resultant model uncertainty. We propose a method for robust visual classification of an object of interest observed from multiple views in the presence of significant localization uncertainty and classifier noise, and possible dataset shift. We use a viewpoint dependent measurement model to capture viewpoint dependence and spatial correlations in classifier scores, showing how to use it in the presence of localization uncertainty. Assuming a Bayesian classifier providing a measure of uncertainty, we show how its outputs can be fused in the context of the above model, allowing robust classification under model uncertainty when novel scenes are encountered. We present statistical evaluation of our method both in synthetic simulation, and in a 3D environment where rendered images are fed into a Deep Neural Network classifier. We compare to baseline methods in scenarios of varying difficulty showing improved robustness of our method to localization uncertainty and dataset shift.

However, it is still challenging to deploy state-of-the-art models into real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, due to their expensive computation costs. In this paper, to accelerate the network inference, we introduce a novel pruning method named Drop-path to reduce model parameters of 2D deep CNNs. Given a trained deep CNN, pruning paths with different lengths is achieved by ordering the influence of neurons in each layer on the probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayesian boundary of the model. We believe that the invariance of PAC-Bayesian boundary is an important factor to guarantee the generalization ability of deep CNN under the condition of optimizing as much as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to reduce model size based on the generalization error boundary. After pruning, we observe that the convolutional kernels themselves become sparse, rather than some being removed directly. In fact, Drop-path is generic and can be well generalized on multi-layer and multi-branch models, since parameter ranking criterion can be applied to any kind of layer and the importance scores can still be propagated.

Walkers are prescribed to users with gait disorders so that they can support their body weight on the upper limbs, however, the manipulation of such devices can be cumbersome for some users. Common problems for the users are lack of dexterous upper limb control and visual impairments. These problems can render walkers’ users helpless, making them unable to operate these devices effectively and efficiently. We present a new approach to robot-assisted navigation using a utility decision and safety analysis procedure with user intent adjustments learned by reinforcement learning (RL) and supported on a rapidly-exploring random tree inspired algorithm. The proposed approach offers full control of the assistive platform to the user until obstacles are detected. In dangerous scenarios, corrections are computed in order that the assistive platform avoids collisions and follows social norms, effectively guiding the user through the environment while enforcing safer routes. The experimental validation was carried out in a virtual environment and in a real world scenario using a robotic walker built in our lab (ISR-AIWALKER). Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach provides a reliable solution to the robot-assisted navigation of a robotic walker, in particular the use of utility theory to evaluate candidate motions together with a RL model increases the safety of the user’s navigation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-019-00585-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Drowsiness detection methods have received considerable attention, but few studies have investigated the implementation of a detection approach on a mobile phone. Phone applications reduce the need for specialised hardware and hence, enable a cost-effective roll-out of the technology across the driving population. While it has been shown that three-dimensional (3D) operations are more suitable for spatiotemporal feature learning, current methods for drowsiness detection commonly use frame-based, multi-step approaches. However, computationally expensive techniques that achieve superior results on action recognition benchmarks (e.g. 3D convolutions, optical flow extraction) create bottlenecks for real-time, safety-critical applications on mobile devices. Here, we show how depthwise separable 3D convolutions, combined with an early fusion of spatial and temporal information, can achieve a balance between high prediction accuracy and real-time inference requirements. In particular, increased accuracy is achieved when assessment requires motion information, for example, when sunglasses conceal the eyes. Further, a custom TensorFlow-based smartphone application shows the true impact of various approaches on inference times and demonstrates the effectiveness of real-time monitoring based on out-of-sample data to alert a drowsy driver. Our model is pre-trained on ImageNet and Kinetics and fine-tuned on a publicly available Driver Drowsiness Detection dataset. Fine-tuning on large naturalistic driving datasets could further improve accuracy to obtain robust in-vehicle performance. Overall, our research is a step towards practical deep learning applications, potentially preventing micro-sleeps and reducing road trauma.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04506-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this regard, energy efficiency hands out challenging aspects, for both home and business usages. Scalability in energy management systems is particularly difficult in those industry sector where power consumption of branches located in remote areas need to be monitored. Being autonomous requires that behavioural rules are automatically extracted from consumption data and applied to the system. Best practices for the specific energy configuration should be devised to achieve optimal energy efficiency. Best practices should also be revised and applied without human intervention against topology changes. In this paper, the Internet of Things paradigm and machine learning techniques are exploited to (1) define a novel system architecture for centralised energy efficiency in distributed sub-networks of electric appliances, (2) extract behavioural rules, identify best practices and detect device types.

Some of these factors are almost entirely novel to AI, while the significance of other factors is heightened by the use of AI.

Besides its direct associated cost; high energy consumption also results in a large amount of CO 2 emission and incurs extra cooling expenditure. The foremost reason for overly energy consumption is the underutilization of data center resources. In modern data centers, virtualization provides a promising approach to improve the hardware utilization level. Virtual machine placement is a process of mapping a group of virtual machines (VMs) onto a set of physical machines (PMs) in a data center with the aim of maximizing resource utilization and minimizing the total power consumption by PMs. An optimal virtual machine placement algorithm substantially contributes to cutting down the power consumption through assigning the input VMs to a minimum number of PMs and allowing the dispensable PMs to be turned off. However, VM Placement Problem is a complex combinatorial optimization problem and known to be NP-Hard problem. This paper presents an extensive review of virtual machine placement problem along with an overview of different approaches for solving virtual machine placement problem. The aim of this paper is to illuminate challenges and issues for current virtual machine placement techniques. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of virtual machine placement based on various aspects such as methodology, number of objectives, operation mode, problem objectives, resource demand type and number of clouds.

In this regard, an integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing network latency has been developed that depicts the network under consideration. Optimization techniques have then been applied to determine the RSU deployment that provides the minimum network latency. The proposed scheme was validated by generating traffic mobility patterns by using VanetMobiSim and performing simulations in NS2.

Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating.

It is understood that the reality gap manifests itself as a drop in performance: when control software generated in simulation is ported to physical robots, the performance observed is often disappointing compared with the one obtained in simulation. In this paper, we investigate whether, to observe the effects of the reality gap, it is necessary to assume that the control software is designed in a context that is simpler than the one in which it is evaluated. In the first experiment, we show that a performance drop may be observed also in an artificial, simulation-only reality gap: control software is generated on the basis of a simulation model and assessed on a second one. We will call this second model a pseudo-reality . We selected the simulation model to be used as a pseudo-reality by trial and error, so as to qualitatively replicate previously published observations made in experiments with physical robots. The results show that a performance drop occurs even if we can exclude that pseudo-reality is more complex than the simulation model used for the design. In the second experiment, we eliminate the trial-and-error selection of the first experiment by evaluating control software across multiple pseudo-realities, which are sampled around the original simulation model used for the design. The results of the second experiment confirm those of the first one and show that they do not depend on the specific pseudo-reality we previously selected by trial and error. Moreover, they suggest that one could use multiple pseudo-realities to evaluate automatic design methods and, from this simulation-only evaluation, infer their robustness to the reality gap.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11721-019-00175-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The fast development of AI needs to be supported by the necessary regulatory insight and oversight for AI-based technologies to enable sustainable development. Failure to do so could result in gaps in transparency, safety, and ethical standards. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more common in people’s lives. Here, the authors use an expert elicitation method to understand how AI may affect the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-14108-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They interact and communicate with their surroundings, requiring high computer vision accuracy to maintain driver and pedestrian safety. Many autonomous vehicles leverage deep learning for detection and utilize a suite of sensors that are specific to their environment or use case. In such deep learning environment, sensor data is used as input to neural networks that make decisions regarding the vehicle’s response or reaction to its environment. These sensors in autonomous vehicles provide details regarding the vehicle’s surroundings and potential obstacles. Many sensor suites are starting to contain light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, as the cost of the technology decreases and becomes more widely available. LiDAR technology uses focused light to detect distance, providing an accurate description of the sensor’s surroundings, such precise account is crucial for autonomous driving in ever-changing smart city environments. This chapter covers different applications of LiDAR technology and the use of the sensor data in deep learning applications for smart cities.

Cooperative connected applications provide a critical foundational pillar for autonomous driving, and hold the promise of improving road safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability. However, they also induce a large and easily exploitable attack surface: an adversary can manipulate vehicular communications to subvert functionality of participating individual vehicles, cause catastrophic accidents, or bring down the transportation infrastructure. In this paper we outline a potential direction to address this critical problem through a resiliency framework, REDEM, based on machine learning. REDEM has several interesting features, including (1) smooth integration with the architecture of the underlying application, (2) ability to handle diverse communication attacks within the same underlying foundation, and (3) real-time detection and mitigation capability. We present the vision of REDEM, identify some key challenges to be addressed in its realization, and discuss the kind of evaluation/analysis necessary for its viability.

In this paper, we determine the sources of uncertainty in machine learning and establish the success criteria of a machine learning system to function well under uncertainty in a cyber-physical manufacturing system (CPMS) scenario. Then, we propose a multi-agent system architecture which leverages probabilistic machine learning as a means of achieving such criteria. We propose possible scenarios for which our architecture is useful and discuss future work.

This has necessitated the creation of transfer learning and domain adaptation as a highly-active area of research, wherein the objective is to adapt a model trained on one set of data from a specific domain to perform well on previously-unseen data from a different domain. In this chapter, we use monocular depth estimation as a means of demonstrating a new perspective on domain adaptation. Most monocular depth estimation approaches either rely on large quantities of ground truth depth data, which is extremely expensive and difficult to obtain, or alternatively predict disparity as an intermediary step using a secondary supervisory signal leading to blurring and other artefacts. Training a depth estimation model using pixel-perfect synthetic depth images can resolve most of these issues but introduces the problem of domain shift from synthetic to real-world data. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in image style transfer and its connection with domain adaptation to predict depth from a single colour image based on training over a large corpus of synthetic data obtained from a virtual environment. Experimental results point to the impressive capabilities of style transfer used as a means of adapting the model to unseen data from a different domain.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45529-3_8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To help bridge this gap, we present the “AI Driving Olympics” (AI-DO), a competition with the objective of evaluating the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence for mobile robotics. Based on the simple and well-specified autonomous driving and navigation environment called “Duckietown,” the AI-DO includes a series of tasks of increasing complexity—from simple lane-following to fleet management. For each task, we provide tools for competitors to use in the form of simulators, logs, code templates, baseline implementations and low-cost access to robotic hardware. We evaluate submissions in simulation online, on standardized hardware environments, and finally at the competition event. The first AI-DO, AI-DO 1, occurred at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference in December 2018. In this paper we will describe the AI-DO 1 including the motivation and design objections, the challenges, the provided infrastructure, an overview of the approaches of the top submissions, and a frank assessment of what worked well as well as what needs improvement. The results of AI-DO 1 highlight the need for better benchmarks, which are lacking in robotics, as well as improved mechanisms to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29135-8_3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Observing that a model generated from adversarial training is more vulnerable against MIA, a novel attack method based on confidence-thresholding was proposed by Song et al. recently. However, it is not a straightforward work to deploy such an attack into real-world application scenarios, since shadow training and redundant assumptions are prerequisites. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose an improved confidence-thresholding method with relaxed assumption, evaluating the prediction accuracy as the threshold. Our attack can be released without using shadow training and an additional dataset. Instead of collecting an additional dataset, attackers use their target data records, which are needed to be inferred about membership, to achieve MIA. As a result, our proposed attack against robust model has an overwhelming advantage on model recall with fewer accuracy and precision loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data, i.e. , Yale Face, and the results show that our proposed MIA attack is effective and feasible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-62460-6_47,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Importantly, the inputs to our system consists of high definition maps, bounding boxes, and trajectories, which can be easily sketched by a test engineer in a matter of minutes.

Artificial Intelligence Practices,10.1007/978-3-030-55789-8_47,Springer,1/1/2020,"Reinforcement learning achieved impressive results in various challenging artificial environments and demonstrated its practical potential. In a real-world environment, an agent operates in continuous time, and it is unavoidable for the agent to have control delay. In the context of reinforcement learning, we define control delays as the time delay before an agent actuates an action in a particular state. The high-variance of control delay can destabilize an agent’s learning performance and make an environment Non-Markovian, creating a challenging situation for reinforcement learning algorithms. To address this issue, we present a scalable real-time architecture, RTAC, for reinforcement learning to continuous control. A reinforcement learning application usually consists of a policy training phase in simulation and the deployment phase of the learned policy to the real-world environment. We evaluated RTAC in a simulated environment close to its real-world setting, where agents operate in real-time and learn to map high-dimensional sensor data to continuous actions. In extensive experiments, RTAC was able to stabilize control delay and consistently learn optimal policies. Additionally, we demonstrated that RTAC was suitable for distributed learning even in the presence of control delay.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-55789-8_47,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While it is often possible to approximate the input-output relations of deep neural networks with a few human-understandable rules, the discovery of the double descent phenomena suggests that such approximations do not accurately capture the mechanism by which deep neural networks work. Double descent indicates that deep neural networks typically operate by smoothly interpolating between data points rather than by extracting a few high level rules. As a result, neural networks trained on complex real world data are inherently hard to interpret and prone to failure if asked to extrapolate. To show how we might be able to trust AI despite these problems we introduce the concept of self-explaining AI. Self-explaining AIs are capable of providing a human-understandable explanation of each decision along with confidence levels for both the decision and explanation. Some difficulties with this approach along with possible solutions are sketched.

Smart data can be used in a variety of smart city applications, but difficulties in managing such data are pushing smart cities toward the adoption of data management frameworks. Many studies have brought into focus the importance of these frameworks as they combine data collection, processing, analysis, management, and visualization and provide privacy and security features for different smart city applications, i.e., transportation, to promote a better quality of life. This chapter highlights key components of the data management framework, reviews various smart city applications, and discusses privacy and security challenges associated with smart city data. From the perspective of data frameworks, it is seen that the data used in smart city applications is unstructured coming from heterogeneous sources, i.e., sensors and social media, besides others. Therefore, the collection, processing, analysis, management, and visualization of such data are challenging. To perform these tasks, recent technologies, i.e., Internet of Things (IoT), sensor networks, machine learning, etc., have been used. Moreover, the use of smart data for smart government and governance provides several facilities for the public and business.

Street Trials of Intelligent Cars as Experiments in Participation,TechnoScienceSociety,10.1007/978-3-030-43965-1_7,Springer,1/1/2020,"This chapter evaluates an emerging paradigm for testing intelligent technology in society through the analysis of recent street trials of self-driving cars. Moving beyond laboratory-based test protocols, street trials of intelligent automotive technology evaluate their performance in social environments, on public roads. They appear to exemplify an experimental approach to the introduction of technology to society, which extends “beta-testing” procedures from technical to social, ethical and political aspects of technology (Jackson et al., 2014). I examine this hypothesis through a discussion of several street trials of intelligent automotive technology: the roll-out of driver-assist by Tesla; an emission test of a VW diesel car in Germany; the Gateway trial in Greenwich (UK). While each of these street tests puts in place arrangements for social and public engagement with intelligent automotive technology, they do not enable an experimental approach to the societal evaluation of technology. They tend to pursue the societal acceptance of technology and do not curate experimental situations in society in which the proposition of self-driving cars can be examined from a societal point of view. However, the contribution of social research should not be limited to diagnosing methodological limitations of current tests of intelligent technology in society. We should examine if street testing can be re-purposed to enable the elicitation of societal aspects of innovation. I conclude with a description of an ‘experiment in participation’ (Lezaun et al., 2016) in which we deployed creative methods to elicit social issues raised by driverless cars, by way of a group exercise conducted in the Driver-in-the-loop simulator at the University of Warwick (Marres et al., 2017).

Existing work seeks to train models robust to new scenarios via domain adaptation, style transfer, or few-shot learning.

It is therefore crucial that the safety of the MLM can be proactively assured and should be driven by explicit and concrete safety requirements. In our previous work, we defined a process that integrates the development and assurance activities for MLMs within safety-related systems. This is used to incrementally generate the safety argument and evidence. In this paper, we apply the approach to pedestrian detection at crossings and provide an evaluation using the publicly available JAAD data set. In particular, we focus on the elicitation and analysis of ML safety requirements and how such requirements should drive the assurance activities within the data management and model learning phases.

The success of deep learning in many pattern recognition applications has brought excitement and high expectations that deep learning, or artificial intelligence (AI), can bring revolutionary changes in health care. Early studies of deep learning applied to lesion detection or classification have reported superior performance compared to those by conventional techniques or even better than radiologists in some tasks. The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss some of these issues and efforts needed to develop robust deep-learning-based CAD tools and integrate these tools into the clinical workflow, thereby advancing towards the goal of providing reliable intelligent aids for patient care.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33128-3_1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the statistical nature of the output, software ‘defects’ are not well defined. Consequently, many traditional quality management techniques such as program debugging, static code analysis, functional testing, etc. have to be reevaluated. Beyond the correctness of an AI model, many other new quality attributes, such as fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency, etc. become important in delivering an AI system.

In this context, the industry still relies heavily on manually annotating and labeling their data. This study investigates the challenges that companies experience when annotating and labeling their data.

When making decisions using data, it is critical to use the most appropriate data. When creating predictive analytics, the selection of data sources is important as the quality of the sources influences the accuracy of the predictive model. Within a smart environment, a dataspace is valuable for data scientists as it provides a one-stop shop of all the data required for creating their analytical models: enterprise data, Internet of Things (IoT), sensor data, and open data. However, the increase in the number of data sources presents a challenge in selecting the most appropriate data source to use. The co-existence approach of dataspaces results in them containing much more data sources than within traditional data management approaches. This means that the need to perform source selection is an ongoing activity; as the dataspace is incrementally improved, sources will need to be re-examined to determine their suitability for tasks.

In this work, we present the Conditional Domain Normalization (CDN) to bridge the domain distribution gap. CDN is designed to encode different domain inputs into a shared latent space, where the features from different domains carry the same domain attribute. To achieve this, we first disentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from source domain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to characterize the domain attribute information. Then this domain-vector is used to encode the features from target domain through a conditional normalization, resulting in different domains’ features carrying the same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages of an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different level’s representation.

On the one hand, systems dealing with strict-timing constraints in safety-critical applications mainly focused on predictability, leaving little room for complex planning and decision-making processes. Indeed, real-time techniques are very efficient in predetermined, constrained, and controlled scenarios. Nevertheless, they lack the necessary flexibility to operate in evolving settings, where the software needs to adapt to the changes of the environment. On the other hand, Intelligent Systems (IS) increasingly adopted Machine Learning (ML) techniques (e.g., subsymbolic predictors such as Neural Networks). The seminal application of those IS started in zero-risk domains producing revolutionary results. However, the ever-increasing exploitation of ML-based approaches generated opaque systems, which are nowadays no longer socially acceptable—calling for eXplainable AI (XAI).

The traditional PTS is in high demand in urban cities and heavily contributes to air pollution, traffic accidents, road congestion, increase of green house gases like oxides of carbon (OC), methane $${({\text {CH}}_4)}$$ , and oxides of nitrogen $${{\text {(NO}}_x)}$$ emissions. PTS also suffers from the limitations of preset routes, privacy, crowd, and less space for passengers. Some PTS are densely crowded in few routes, whereas in other routes they are not crowded at all. Thus, the aforementioned limitations of toxic emissions coupled with load management and balancing in PTS are a critical issue. The paper proposes IIGPTS : IoT-based framework for Intelligent Green Public Transportation System that addresses the mentioned issues by measuring emission sensor readings with respect to varying parameters like passenger density (total carrying load), fuel consumption, and routing paths. The performance of IIGPTS is analyzed at an indicated time slot to measure emissions and load on the system. Then, the simulation is performed based on dynamic routes by increasing passenger load and measuring the service time for user traffic as requests, also considering the request drops. The results obtained by IIGPTS framework indicate a delay of 104 s for 10,000 requests spread across an entire day, which is negligible considering the load.

However, the effectiveness of such intelligent functionality requires in-situ continuous model adaptation for adapting to new data and environments, while the on-device computing and energy resources are usually extremely constrained. Neither traditional hand-crafted (e.g., SGD, Adagrad, and Adam) nor existing meta optimizers are specifically designed to meet those challenges, as the former requires tedious hyper-parameter tuning while the latter are often costly due to the meta algorithms’ own overhead. To this end, we propose hardware-aware learning to optimize (HALO) , a practical meta optimizer dedicated to resource-efficient on-device adaptation. Our HALO optimizer features the following highlights: (1) faster adaptation speed (i.e., taking fewer data or iterations to reach a specified accuracy) by introducing a new regularizer to promote empirical generalization; and (2) lower per-iteration complexity , thanks to a stochastic structural sparsity regularizer being enforced. Furthermore, the optimizer itself is designed as a very light-weight RNN and thus incurs negligible overhead. Ablation studies and experiments on five datasets, six optimizees, and two state-of-the-art (SOTA) edge AI devices validate that, while always achieving a better accuracy ( $$\uparrow $$ ↑ 0.46% - $$\uparrow $$ ↑ 20.28%), HALO can greatly trim down the energy cost (up to $$\downarrow $$ ↓ 60%) in adaptation, quantified using an IoT device or SOTA simulator.

The societal impacts of data-driven technologies are the next big sustainability challenge. Leaders need to act early to curtail or avoid privacy and ethical risks.

Nothing short of revolutionary is required to address this emergency. However, there is hope: shared mobility and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could cut $$\mathrm {CO}_2$$ emissions by 73% and congestion by 24% if managed by appropriate policies. This paper presents a vision and a concept for future distributed management systems for complex multi-modal transport networks that exploit Multi Agent Systems (MAS) to support individual actors based on data collected from heterogeneous sources like vehicles, freight items, infrastructures, Global Positioning Systems (GPS); and simulations of the behaviour of the many different actors involved in the transport system.

AI has the capability to gather and quickly synthesize information from thousands of sources to produce highly accurate estimates of locations for missile-submarines, or land-based mobile launchers. Thus, mobile nuclear assets for deterrence may become easier targets, which reduces the threat of successful retaliation after a deliberate first-strike. Other traditional forms of defense may also be rendered obsolete. While traditional defenses are designed to protect against larger, stronger weapons, AI has the new capability to operate autonomous weapons at the miniaturized level. Miniature devices can fly toward a target undetected and then swarm together at the last minute to deliver a powerful, coordinated blow through autonomous synchronization. Many critics encourage policy makers to prevent AI weapons from ever killing humans as part of a military mission without first receiving explicit permission from a human operator. However, other experts warn that AI may someday evolve beyond submission to their human controllers, and may independently and dynamically set up their own new missions and goals which may conflict with the original designers. AI is currently an area of intense research for China and Russia. Moral objections to AI by contractor-technicians in the US may slow new development by the DOD. However, US commercial development of AI is moving forward rapidly, and can be seen in new products such as self-driving cars.

Big data is being generated from various sources such as Internet of Things (IoT) and social media. Big data cannot be processed by traditional tools and technologies due to their properties, volume, velocity, veracity, and variety. The problems and relevant data are typically large and, hence, give rise to large graphs, which could be analyzed and solved using big data technologies. We use the US road network data, modelled as graphs, and calculate shortest paths between a set of large numbers of vertices in parallel. The experiments are performed on the Aziz supercomputer. We analyze Spark’s parallelization behavior by solving problems of varying graph sizes, i.e., various states of the USA (with over 58 million edges), and varying number of shortest path queries up to one million. We achieve good performance, and as expected, the speedup is dependent on both the size of the data and the number of parallel nodes.

Disaster management plays a key role in reducing the human and economic losses. Our earlier work has focused on developing a disaster management system leveraging technologies including vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and cloud computing to devise city evacuation strategies.

In-memory computations and graphics processing units (GPUs) were used to address intensive and timely computational demands of deep learning over big data in disaster situations.

Howbeit, in some cases, it has been found that the manual practice of collecting and analysing such data often leads to delay in reporting about the issues and fixing them on time. Also, repairing potholes is time consuming, and locating these manually is a huge task. We want to find out some mechanism which can identify the construction conditions as well as any kind of deformities on the road from the dashboard camera fitted into a car, and at the same time, can analyse the conditions of road surface and formation of potholes on the road. Optimization of manual pothole detection through automation has been a part of scientific research since long. Pothole identification has significantly been adapted in different screening and maintenance systems. But in our country, owing to the large number of road networks and wide variations in the nature of rural and urban road conditions, it is very difficult to identify potholes through an automated system. In this paper, we have looked into several methods of Computer Vision, like image processing techniques and object detection method so as to identify potholes from the video input stream to the system. But these techniques have been found to have different challenges like lighting conditions, interference in the line of vision on waterlogged roads, and inefficiency at night vision. Hence, furthermore, we have explored the viability of Deep Learning method for identifying the potholes from the processing of input video streams, and have also analysed the Convolutional Neural Networks approach of Deep Learning through a self-built CNN model.

In this paper, we show that the resulting networks are sensitive not only to global adversarial attacks, where perturbations affect the entire input image, but also to indirect local attacks, where the perturbations are confined to a small image region that does not overlap with the area that the attacker aims to fool. To this end, we introduce an indirect attack strategy, namely adaptive local attacks, aiming to find the best image location to perturb, while preserving the labels at this location and producing a realistic-looking segmentation map. Furthermore, we propose attack detection techniques both at the global image level and to obtain a pixel-wise localization of the fooled regions. Our results are unsettling: Because they exploit a larger context, more accurate semantic segmentation networks are more sensitive to indirect local attacks. We believe that our comprehensive analysis will motivate the community to design architectures with contextual dependencies that do not trade off robustness for accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58558-7_36,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These smart mobility services thus need to be very well protected against a variety of security threats, such as intrusion, jamming, and Sybil attacks. One of the frequently cited attacks in smart mobility is the jamming attack. In order to detect the jamming attacks, different anti-jamming applications have been developed to reduce the impact of malicious jamming attacks. One important step in anti-jamming detection is to cluster the vehicular data. However, it is usually very time-consuming to detect the jamming attacks that may affect the safety of roads and vehicle communication in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient big data clustering model, coresets-based clustering, to support the real-time detection of jamming attacks.

Most existing works evaluate the security of those devices by analyzing the environment data (e.g., network traffic, sensor data, etc.). However, such approaches entail collecting data from encrypted traffic, relying on the quality of the collected data for their accuracy, and facing difficulties in preserving both utility and privacy of the data.

Specifically, intrusion detection for industrial networks (IIoT) has great importance. For instance, it is a key factor in improving the safe operation of the smart grid systems yet protecting the privacy of the consumers at the same time. In the same manner, data streaming is a valid option when the analysis is to be pushed from the cloud to the fog for industrial networks to provide agile response, since it brings the advantage of fast action on intrusion detection and also can buy time for intrusion mitigation.

We are motivated in this pursuit by the fact that the physical world itself is mostly static, and multiview correspondence labels are relatively cheap to collect in static scenes, e.g., by triangulation. We propose to leverage multiview data of static points in arbitrary scenes (static or dynamic), to learn a neural 3D mapping module which produces features that are correspondable across time. The neural 3D mapper consumes RGB-D data as input, and produces a 3D voxel grid of deep features as output. We train the voxel features to be correspondable across viewpoints, using a contrastive loss, and correspondability across time emerges automatically. At test time, given an RGB-D video with approximate camera poses, and given the 3D box of an object to track, we track the target object by generating a map of each timestep and locating the object’s features within each map. In contrast to models that represent video streams in 2D or 2.5D, our model’s 3D scene representation is disentangled from projection artifacts, is stable under camera motion, and is robust to partial occlusions. We test the proposed architectures in challenging simulated and real data, and show that our unsupervised 3D object trackers outperform prior unsupervised 2D and 2.5D trackers, and approach the accuracy of supervised trackers. This work demonstrates that 3D object trackers can emerge without tracking labels, through multiview self-supervision on static data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58574-7_36,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is becoming pervasive in every aspect of smart city daily life and considered as one of the four fundamental conceptual approaches of the fourth generation industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). CPS used to describe the next generation of a diverse spectrum of complicated, multidisciplinary, physically comprehending engineered systems that integrates embedded cyber aspects into the physical world. It implants computation technologies, communication control, the convergence of information, and physical processes together with strategic importance internationally. CPS is still a vast research area. As a result, it opens venues for applications across multiple scales.

To plan future human motion, it is crucial to perceive the environment – imagine how hard it is to navigate a new room with lights off. Existing works on predicting human motion do not pay attention to the scene context and thus struggle in long-term prediction. In this work, we propose a novel three-stage framework that exploits scene context to tackle this task. Given a single scene image and 2D pose histories, our method first samples multiple human motion goals, then plans 3D human paths towards each goal, and finally predicts 3D human pose sequences following each path. For stable training and rigorous evaluation, we contribute a synthetic dataset with clean annotations.

Decision-making mimics human activity which in turn has noteworthy impacts. Several researches have proved that the quality of decisions has been improved by developing computer-based technologies that aid and extend the human capabilities. Decision support systems (DSS), which augment in making proper decisions, to an extent do sometimes lack intelligence. The recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have made this possible in a wide range of multifarious applications. AI has the capability of mimicking human decision-making and has also shown that they are capable of assisting and improving human decision-making in real-time complex environments.

However, as these systems are increasingly deployed into safety-critical environments with aleatoric uncertainties, and with the increase in components that employ machine learning algorithms with epistemic uncertainties, validation methods which consider uncertainties are lacking. We present an approach that evaluates signal propagation in logical system architectures, in particular environment perception-chains, focusing on effects of uncertainty to determine functional limitations. The perception based autonomous driving systems are represented by connected elements to constitute a certain functionality. The elements are based on (meta-)models to describe technical components and their behavior. The surrounding environment, in which the system is deployed, is modeled by parameters that are derived from a quasi-static scene. All parameter variations completely define input-states for the designed perception architecture. The input-states are treated as random variables inside the model of components to simulate aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty. The dissimilarity between the model-input and -output serves as measure for total uncertainty present in the system. The uncertainties are propagated through consecutive components and calculated by the same manner. The final result consists of input-states which model uncertainty effects for the specified functionality and therefore highlight shortcomings of the designed architecture.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58920-2_10,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, recent studies have revealed that deep object detectors can be compromised under adversarial attacks, causing a victim detector to detect no object, fake objects, or mislabeled objects. With object detection being used pervasively in many security-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities, we argue that a holistic approach for an in-depth understanding of adversarial attacks and vulnerabilities of deep object detection systems is of utmost importance for the research community to develop robust defense mechanisms. This paper presents a framework for analyzing and evaluating vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art object detectors under an adversarial lens, aiming to analyze and demystify the attack strategies, adverse effects, and costs, as well as the cross-model and cross-resolution transferability of attacks. Using a set of quantitative metrics, extensive experiments are performed on six representative deep object detectors from three popular families (YOLOv3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) with two benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO). We demonstrate that the proposed framework can serve as a methodical benchmark for analyzing adversarial behaviors and risks in real-time object detection systems.

Frequent updates of software components are likely to become the norm even for safety-critical systems. In this setting, a full re-certification before each software update might delay important updates that fix previous bugs, or security or safety issues. Here we propose a vision addressing this challenge, namely through the evidence-based continuous supervision and certification of software variants in the field. The idea is to run both old and new variants of component software inside the same system, together with a supervising instance that monitors their behavior. Updated variants are phased into operation after sufficient evidence for correct behavior has been collected. The variants are required to explicate their decisions in a logical language, enabling the supervisor to reason about these decisions and to identify inconsistencies. To resolve contradictory information, the supervisor can run a component analysis to identify potentially faulty components on the basis of previously observed behavior, and can trigger micro-experiments which plan and execute system behavior specifically aimed at reducing uncertainty. We spell out our overall vision, and provide a first formalization of the different components and their interplay.

However, future prediction is challenging due to the interaction and uncertainty in driving behaviors. We propose planning-informed trajectory prediction (PiP) to tackle the prediction problem in the multi-agent setting. Our approach is differentiated from the traditional manner of prediction, which is only based on historical information and decoupled with planning. By informing the prediction process with the planning of the ego vehicle, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance of multi-agent forecasting on highway datasets. Moreover, our approach enables a novel pipeline which couples the prediction and planning, by conditioning PiP on multiple candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, which is highly beneficial for autonomous driving in interactive scenarios.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58589-1_36,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Motivated primarily by surveillance and self-driving applications, these datasets provide tracks for people, vehicles, and animals, ignoring the vast majority of objects in the world. By contrast, in the related field of object detection, the introduction of large-scale, diverse datasets (e.g., COCO) have fostered significant progress in developing highly robust solutions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a similarly diverse dataset for Tracking Any Object (TAO) ( http://taodataset.org/ ). It consists of 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. Importantly, we adopt a bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask annotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names to them post factum. Our vocabulary is both significantly larger and qualitatively different from existing tracking datasets. To ensure scalability of annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on labeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move). We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a number of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an open-world. In particular, we show that existing single- and multi-object trackers struggle when applied to this scenario in the wild, and that detection-based, multi-object trackers are in fact competitive with user-initialized ones.

For detecting 3D keypoints we predict the discriminativeness of the local descriptors in an unsupervised manner. We generate the global descriptor by directly aggregating the learned local descriptors with an effective attention mechanism. In this way, local and global 3D descriptors are inferred in one single forward pass. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results for both global point cloud retrieval and local point cloud registration in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. To validate the generalizability and robustness of our 3D keypoints, we demonstrate that our method also performs favorably without fine-tuning on the registration of point clouds that were generated by a visual SLAM system.

The reason for this is not due to limitations in robot hardware, which has advanced significantly in the past decade, but in how multi-robot problems are solved. Even with significant advances in the field of multi-robot systems, the same problem-solving paradigm has remained: assumptions are made to simplify the problem, and a solution is optimized for those assumptions and deployed to the entire team.

Calibration workflows involve a number of parties such as device users, manufacturers, calibration facilities and NMIs who must collaborate but may also compete (mutually untrusting). For instance, a surgical robot manufacturer may wish to hide the identities of third-parties from the operator (hospital), in order to maintain confidentiality of business relationships around its robot products. Thus, information flows that reveal who-calibrates-for-whom need to be managed to ensure confidentiality. Similarly, meta-information about what-is-being-calibrated and how-often-it-is-calibrated may compromise operational confidentiality of a deployment. We show that the challenge of managing information flows between the parties involved in calibration cannot be met by any of the classical access control models, as any one of them, or a simple conjunction of a subset such as the lattice model, fails to meet the desired access control requirements. We demonstrate that a new unified access control model that combines BIBA, BLP, and Chinese Walls holds rich promise. We study the case for unification, system properties, and develop an XACML-based authorisation framework which enforces the unified model. We show that upon evaluation against a baseline simple-conjunction of the three models individually, our unified model outperforms with authorisation times at least 10ms lower than the baseline.

Many of these features are related to advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous driving systems. This capability improvement, has been achieved because of recent developments of automation oriented software and hardware. Such improvements, allowed the vehicle to achieve a more precise perception of it’s working environment. For this improvement it is important the integration and simulation of the systems in different configurations, such as hardware-in-the-loop, software-in-the-loop and model-in-the-loop. In this paper, we present a framework proposal that allows the design and testing of computer vision and control systems for the partial automation of a vehicle, with the use of hardware and software systems in the loop. This proposal is focused on the rapid experimental development of these systems for the implementation by autonomous vehicle designers and engineers.

By using machine learning techniques, computer applications can be developed and used to solve tasks that have hitherto been assumed not to be solvable by computers. If these achievements consider applications that collect and process personal data, this is typically perceived as a threat to information privacy. This paper aims to discuss applications from both fields of personality and image analysis. These applications are often criticized by reference to the protection of privacy. This paper critically questions this approach. Instead of solely using the concept of privacy to address the risks of machine learning, it is increasingly necessary to consider and implement ethical anti-discrimination concepts, too. In many ways, informational privacy requires individual information control. However, not least because of machine learning technologies, information control has become obsolete.

This is applied also to production logistics settings with a multitude of transport tasks, e.g., between warehousing or material supply stations and production locations within larger production sites as for example in the automotive industry. In most cases, mixed environments where automated systems and humans collaborate (e.g., cobots) are not in the center of analysis and development endeavors although the worker’s adoption and acceptance of new technologies are of crucial relevance. From an interdisciplinary research perspective, this constitutes an important research gap, as the future challenges for successful automated systems will rely mainly on human-computer interaction (HCI) in connection with an efficient collaboration between motivated workers, automated robotics, and transportation systems. We develop a HCI efficiency description in production logistics based on an interdisciplinary analysis consisting of three interdependent parts: (i) a production logistics literature review and process study, (ii) a computer science literature review and simulation study for an existing autonomous traffic control algorithm applicable to production logistics settings with the specific inclusion of human actors, and (iii) a work science analysis for automation settings referring to theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the management of workers in digital work settings.

At the same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks) to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double-edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applications themselves, which may pose severe security threats. We argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that, to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for cybersecurity is necessary. To this end, we offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity. Current national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments mention explicitly the use of AI. However, it will be important to develop standards and certification procedures, which involves continuous monitoring and assessment of threats.

More specifically, it provides answers to three research questions, namely how alliance-driven MSPs come into existence and evolve, how different stakeholder groups use certain governance mechanisms during the platform design process, and how this process is influenced by regulatory instruments. By contrasting the case of an alliance-driven MSP with the more common approach of the keystone-driven MSP, the results of the case study suggest that different evolutionary paths can be pursued during the early stages of an MSP’s lifecycle. Furthermore, the IDS initiative considers trust and data sovereignty more relevant regulatory instruments compared to pricing, for example.

This article provides an overview of AI and current applications in healthcare, a review of recent original research on AI specific to mental health, and a discussion of how AI can supplement clinical practice while considering its current limitations, areas needing additional research, and ethical implications regarding AI technology. Recent Findings We reviewed 28 studies of AI and mental health that used electronic health records (EHRs), mood rating scales, brain imaging data, novel monitoring systems (e.g., smartphone, video), and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental health illnesses including depression, schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, and suicide ideation and attempts. Collectively, these studies revealed high accuracies and provided excellent examples of AI’s potential in mental healthcare, but most should be considered early proof-of-concept works demonstrating the potential of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to address mental health questions, and which types of algorithms yield the best performance. Summary As AI techniques continue to be refined and improved, it will be possible to help mental health practitioners re-define mental illnesses more objectively than currently done in the DSM-5, identify these illnesses at an earlier or prodromal stage when interventions may be more effective, and personalize treatments based on an individual’s unique characteristics.

With the growth of these types of services, the numbers of users are increasing at an exponential rate, and numbers of devices are being used for it, e.g., wearable equipment, smartphones, tablets, personal computers or laptops, and smart televisions. Real-time object tracking and identification of the state of drowsiness of driver is a challenging area of research. An increasing number of good results are reported concerning its robustness and accuracy. Frequently, no clear statements about the tracking situations are made, when it comes to the application of these methods to real-world problems. In order to address the problem of identification of the state of the drowsiness of driver, a research project has been initiated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This research aims to avoid road accidents due to the drowsiness of drivers by keeping them active through suitable means. Different methods are analyzed to detect the driver’s drowsiness, and a state of the art solution is proposed in this research. At the current state, we are considering the openness and closeness of eyes for detecting the driver’s drowsiness. Various techniques are analyzed to keep the fatigued driver active. In the case of the inevitable effect of drowsiness and the abnormal response of the driver towards alerts, the driver’s location and sufficient information of the driver’s state are communicated with the Police Base station. As a result of this research, we are optimistic about coming up with highly positive results in its social, economic and industrial benefits.

First, we present a template-driven learning approach that requires two inputs: a set of observed traces and a template STL formula. The unknown parameters in the template can include time-bounds of the temporal operators, as well as the thresholds in the inequality predicates. TeLEx finds the value of the unknown parameters such that the synthesized STL property is satisfied by all the provided traces and it is tight . This requirement of tightness is essential to generating interesting properties when only positive examples are provided and there is no option to actively query the dynamical system to discover the boundaries of legal behavior. We propose a novel quantitative semantics for satisfaction of STL properties which enables TeLEx to learn tight STL properties without multidimensional optimization. The proposed new metric is also smooth. This is critical to enable the use of gradient-based numerical optimization engines and it produces a 30x to 100x speed-up with respect to the state-of-art gradient-free optimization. Second, we present a novel technique for automatically learning the structure of the STL formula by incrementally constructing more complex formula guided by the robustness metric of subformula.

Traditionally, in such missions, robots passively gather data along prescribed paths, while inference, path planning, and other high level decision making is largely performed by a supervisory science team located at a different location, often at a great distance. However, communication constraints hinder these processes, and hence the rate of scientific progress. This paper presents an active perception approach that aims to reduce robots’ reliance on human supervision and improve science productivity by encoding scientists’ domain knowledge and decision making process on-board. We present a Bayesian network architecture to compactly model critical aspects of scientific knowledge while remaining robust to observation and modeling uncertainty. We then formulate path planning and sensor scheduling as an information gain maximization problem, and propose a sampling-based solution based on Monte Carlo tree search to plan informative sensing actions which exploit the knowledge encoded in the network. The computational complexity of our framework does not grow with the number of observations taken and allows long horizon planning in an anytime manner, making it highly applicable to field robotics with constrained computing.

MoSH provides a set of modeling constructs and a methodology to specify executable test models, which capture expected system behaviors and environmental uncertainties. TM-Executor executes the test models together with the systems under test, to dynamically test their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties.

This will become even more prominent in the near future considering the development of autonomous driving functionality. The need to consider ethical principles in the design of such systems is generally acknowledged. However, scope, principles and strategies for their implementations are not yet clear. Most of the current discussions concentrate on situations of unavoidable crashes in which the life of human beings is existentially affected. In this paper, we argue that ethical considerations should be mandatory for any algorithmic decision of autonomous vehicles, instead of a limitation to hazard situations. Such an ethically aligned behavior is relevant because autonomous vehicles, like any other traffic participants, operate in a shared public space, where every behavioral decision impacts the operational possibilities of others. These possibilities concern the fulfillment of a road-user’s safety, utility and comfort needs. We propose that, to operate ethically in such space, an autonomous vehicle will have to take its behavior decisions according to a just distribution of operational possibilities among all traffic participants. Using an application on a partially-autonomous prototype vehicle, we describe how to apply and implement concepts of distributive justice to the driving environment and demonstrate the impact on its behavior in comparison to an advanced but egoistic decision maker.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10676-019-09504-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Moreover, it can predict the traffic flow for various penetration rates of connected vehicles (the ratio of the number of connected vehicles to the total number of vehicles). At first, the Kalman filter equations are calibrated using data derived from Vissim traffic simulator for different penetration rates, different fluctuating arrival rates of vehicles and various signal settings. Then the filter is evaluated for a variety of traffic scenarios generated in Vissim simulator. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm for different penetration rates under several traffic situations using some statistical measures.

In this paper, I challenge the anthropomorphic credentials of the neural network algorithm, whose similarities to human cognition I argue are vastly overstated and narrowly construed. I submit that three alternative supervised learning methods—namely lasso penalties, bagging, and boosting—offer subtler, more interesting analogies to human reasoning as both an individual and a social phenomenon. Despite the temptation to fall back on anthropomorphic tropes when discussing AI, however, I conclude that such rhetoric is at best misleading and at worst downright dangerous.

The control method integrates an adaptive radial basis function neural networks to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics with certainty equivalent control technique, in this way leading to the fact that precise dynamic model and prior information of disturbances are not needed. The adaptation law was derived by using a Lyapunov theory to verify the stability and superiority of the new algorithms.

In this algorithm, each bacterium can adopt its run-length unit to appropriately balance exploitation and exploration states, and the quality of position or solution is calculated on the basis of the binary quality indicator to determine the Pareto dominance relation. Our algorithm uses Pareto concept and preference indicator-based measure to determine the non-dominated solutions in each generation, which can essentially reduce the computation complexity. With several mathematical benchmark functions, I-MOBCA is proved to have significantly better performance over compared algorithms for solving some complex multi-objective optimization problems.

These sensors can be built-in or remotely connected to such devices. Given that such monitoring services are usually invoked within devices that have limited IT resource capacities, it is impossible to collect data of all metrics in the application’s context with a very high frequency. In this paper, we propose a framework that determines which metrics to monitor, monitoring start times, the optimal allocation of metrics to devices, and the optimal monitoring frequency of these metrics, without exceeding different device-specific time-varying resource capacities. Our approach is also adaptive; it gives updated solutions whenever a trigger happens in the system necessitating the need for a change in the previous optimal decisions. We provide an implementation of our approach and present numerical results showing its usage and limitations. At the heart of our approach is an integer programming optimization model that might be hard to solve for large-sized IoT systems.

Various kinds of smart devices have been launched and applied in our daily lives to provide services for individuals; however, the existing computing frameworks including local silo-based and cloud-based architectures, are not quite fit for personal computing services. Meanwhile, personal computing applications exhibit special features, they are latency-sensitive, energy efficient, highly reliable, mobile, etc, which further indicates that a new computing architecture is urgently needed to support such services. Thanks to the emerging edge computing paradigm, we were inspired to apply the distributed cooperative computing idea at the data source, which perfectly solves issues occurring among existing computing paradigms while meeting the requirements of personal computing services. Therefore, we explore personal computing services utilizing the edge computing paradigm, discuss the overall edge-based system architecture for personal computing services, and design the conceptual framework for an edge-based personal computing system. We analyze the functionalities in detail. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a fall detection application is simulated in our preliminary evaluation as an example service in which three Support Vector Machine based fall detection algorithms with different kernel functions are implemented. Experimental results show edge computing architecture can improve the performance of the system in terms of total latency, with about 22.75% reduction on average in the case of applying 4G at the second hop even when the data and computing stream of the application is small.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-018-00697-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Some users may be blocked from getting their requested services due to this high load. Using a two-hop relay architecture can help in increasing the system capacity, increasing coverage area, decreasing energy consumption, and reducing the BS load. Clustering techniques can be used to configure the nodes in such two-layer topology. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relay selection based on the Basic Sequential Algorithmic Scheme (BSAS) along with power control protocol. Unlike other capacity improving techniques such as small cells and relay stations this approach does not require additional infrastructure. Instead, users themselves will act as a temporary relay stations. Modifications are implemented to the original BSAS to make it suitable for LTE environment and to improve its performance. The protocol for resource allocation and power control is implemented assuming a multi cell scenario. The algorithm is compared to other relaying and clustering schemes in addition to the conventional LTE. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has improved system capacity and energy consumption compared to other existing clustering/relaying schemes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-018-1658-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper proposes a novel method to locate obstacles in the scene by comprehensively utilizing the sparse point clouds captured by a Lidar and the natural image taken from a camera. We do this because Lidar is able to capture the data accurately, while the object details can be perfectly preserved by an image. To establish the depth map, the proposed method firstly uses cross-calibration to align the point clouds with reference image. Then we introduce the common U-disparity map in the stereo vision to deal with this depth map and extract all the points belonging to obstacles. By employing 3D point coordinates and the pairwise image pixels as input, the features for density based clustering technique are learned from a specific sparse regression model. After adopting the clustering technique, the corresponding obstacles can be localized by a subset of the relevant points.

Their advantage over solely teleoperated robots is that they can address the task handling and situation awareness limitations of human operators by providing some level of autonomy to the multi-robot team. Our research focuses on developing learning-based semi-autonomous controllers for rescue robot teams. In this paper, we specifically investigate the influence of the operator-to-robot ratio on the performance of our proposed MAXQ hierarchical reinforcement learning based semi-autonomous controller for USAR missions. In particular, we propose a unique learning-based system architecture that allows operator control of larger numbers of rescue robots in a team as well as effective sharing of information between these robots. A rigorous comparative study of our learning-based semi-autonomous controller versus a fully teleoperation-based approach was conducted in a 3D simulation environment. The results, as expected, show that, for both semi-autonomous and teleoperation modes, the total scene exploration time increases as the number of robots utilized increases. However, when using the proposed learning-based semi-autonomous controller, the rate of exploration-time increase and operator-interaction effort are significantly lower, while task performance is significantly higher. Furthermore, an additional case study showed that our learning-based approach can provide more scene coverage during robot exploration when compared to a non-learning based method.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-018-0899-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, as know-how in its particular algorithmic embodiment, computation is closed to meaning. Therefore, computer-based data processing can only mimic life’s creative aspects, without being creative itself. AI’s current record of accomplishments shows that it automates tasks associated with intelligence, without being intelligent itself. Mistaking the abstract (computation) for the concrete (computer) has led to the religion of “everything is an output of computation”—even the humankind that conceived the computer. The hypostatized role of computers explains the increased dependence on them. The convergence machine called deep learning is only the most recent form through which the deterministic theology of the machine claims more than what it actually is: extremely effective data processing.

In particular, the more research in HCI evolves towards natural, socially engaging approaches, the more there is the need to rapidly design and deploy software architectures to support these new paradigms.

Several prioritized tasks distributed in a large scale terrain is defined first; then, considering the limitations over the mission time, vehicle’s battery, uncertainty and variability of the underlying operating field, appropriate mission timing and energy management is undertaken. The proposed objective is fulfilled by incorporating a route-planner that is in charge of prioritizing the list of available tasks according to available battery and a path-planer that acts in a smaller scale to provide vehicle’s safe deployment against environmental sudden changes. The synchronous process of the task assign-route and path planning is simulated using a specific composition of Differential Evolution and Firefly Optimization (DEFO) Algorithms. The simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid model offers efficient performance in terms of completion of maximum number of assigned tasks while perfectly expending the minimum energy, provided by using the favorable current flow, and controlling the associated mission time.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level benchmarks in classifying novel images. These advances support technologies such as autonomous vehicles and machine diagnosis; but beyond this, they serve as candidate models for human vision itself. However, unlike humans, CNNs are “fooled” by adversarial examples—nonsense patterns that machines recognize as familiar objects, or seemingly irrelevant image perturbations that nevertheless alter the machine’s classification. Such bizarre behaviors challenge the promise of these new advances; but do human and machine judgments fundamentally diverge? Here, we show that human and machine classification of adversarial images are robustly related: In 8 experiments on 5 prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects correctly anticipated the machine’s preferred label over relevant foils—even for images described as “totally unrecognizable to human eyes”. Human intuition may be a surprisingly reliable guide to machine (mis)classification—with consequences for minds and machines alike.

And since a robot’s behavior is often a direct result of its underlying objective function, our insight is that end-users need to have an accurate mental model of this objective function in order to understand and predict what the robot will do. While people naturally develop such a mental model over time through observing the robot act, this familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from observed behavior, in order to then show those behaviors that are maximally informative. We introduce two factors to define candidate models of human inference, and show that certain models indeed produce example robot behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what it will do in novel situations. Our results also reveal that choosing the appropriate model is key, and suggest that our candidate models do not fully capture how humans extrapolate from examples of robot behavior.

This chapter provides an introduction to key AI technologies, investigates to what extent they involve anticipatory processes, and explores the consequences of such anticipation on the predictability of AI systems for humans. Our analysis suggests that the relationship between human and AI anticipation is complementary - the more pronounced the anticipatory capabilities of the AI system, the harder it may be for humans to anticipate their behaviour. If this turns out to be correct, building safe, responsible, and ethically sound AI will require developing more understandable and explainable AI methods in the future.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91554-8_45,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we propose ShapeShifter , an attack that tackles the more challenging problem of crafting physical adversarial perturbations to fool image-based object detectors like Faster R-CNN. Attacking an object detector is more difficult than attacking an image classifier, as it needs to mislead the classification results in multiple bounding boxes with different scales. Extending the digital attack to the physical world adds another layer of difficulty, because it requires the perturbation to be robust enough to survive real-world distortions due to different viewing distances and angles, lighting conditions, and camera limitations. We show that the Expectation over Transformation technique, which was originally proposed to enhance the robustness of adversarial perturbations in image classification, can be successfully adapted to the object detection setting. ShapeShifter can generate adversarially perturbed stop signs that are consistently mis-detected by Faster R-CNN as other objects, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and other safety-critical computer vision systems.

Digitization, decentralization, and high connectivity, as well as incorporation of various enabling technologies, raise various security issues. These security concerns may affect safety, endangering assets and even human lives. This is especially true for CPS utilization in different sectors of great significance, including manufacturing or critical infrastructures, creating a need for efficiently handling relevant security issues. Including security as part of a software-intensive technical system (i.e., the CPS) that can be distributed and highly resilient highlights the need for appropriate security methodologies to be applied on the CPS from the engineering stage during CPS design. The efficient security-related processes that are implemented at design time have an impact on security monitoring during the CPS operational phase (at run-time). Efficient and accurate security monitoring that follows security-by-design principles can be a potent tool in the hands of the CPS manager for detecting and mitigating cyber threats. Monitoring traffic and activity at the system boundaries, detecting changes to device status and configuration, detecting suspicious activity indicating attacks, detecting unauthorized activity that is suspicious or violates security policies, and timely responding to security incidents and recovering from them are issues that need to be efficiently tackled with by security monitoring. In this chapter, we explore the various CPS cybersecurity threats and discuss how adding security as a parameter at the CPS design phase can provide a well-structured and efficient approach on providing strong security CPS foundations. New technologies on CPS security design are presented and emerging security directions are discussed. Furthermore, in the chapter, the different aspects of security monitoring are presented with a special emphasis on CPSs, discussing the various existing monitoring approaches that are followed in order to detect security issues at run-time.

Training is done through imitation learning with data augmentation to allow for the correction of navigation mistakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained network (when sufficient data augmentation is used) outperforms state-of-the-art methods and flies more consistently than many human pilots.

Currently, machine learning is increasingly integrated in many applications and thereby, becomes part of everyday life, and automates decisions based on predictions. In certain domains, such as medical diagnosis, security, autonomous driving, and financial trading, wrong predictions can have a significant influence on individuals and groups. While advances in prediction accuracy have been impressive, machine learning systems still can make rather unexpected mistakes on relatively easy examples, and the robustness of algorithms has become a reason for concern before deploying such systems in real-world applications. Recent research has shown that especially deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks that can trigger such wrong predictions. For image analysis tasks, these attacks are in the form of small perturbations that remain (almost) imperceptible to human vision. Such attacks can cause a neural network classifier to completely change its prediction about an image, with the model even reporting a high confidence about the wrong prediction. Of particular interest for an attacker are so-called backdoor attacks, where a specific key is embedded into a data sample, to trigger a pre-defined class prediction. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of poisoning (backdoor) attacks on a number of benchmark datasets from the domain of autonomous driving.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29726-8_18,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The power of evidence-based, inductive reasoning distinguishes data science from science. Hence, this chapter argues that, in its initial stages, data science applications and the data science discipline itself be developed inductively and deductively in a virtuous cycle. The virtues of the twentieth Century Virtuous Cycle (aka virtuous hardware-software cycle, Intel-Microsoft virtuous cycle) that built the personal computer industry (National Research Council, The new global ecosystem in advanced computing: Implications for U.S. competitiveness and national security. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2012) were being grounded in reality and being self-perpetuating—more powerful hardware enabled more powerful software that required more powerful hardware, enabling yet more powerful software, and so forth. Being grounded in reality—solving genuine problems at scale—was critical to its success, as it will be for data science. While it lasted, it was self-perpetuating, due to a constant flow of innovation, and to benefitting all participants—producers, consumers, the industry, the economy, and society. It is a wonderful success story for twentieth Century applied science . Given the success of virtuous cycles in developing modern technology, virtuous cycles grounded in reality should be used to develop data science, driven by the wisdom of the sixteenth Century proverb, Necessity is the mother of invention. This chapter explores this hypothesis using the example of the evolution of database management systems over the last 40 years. For the application of data science to be successful and virtuous, it should be grounded in a cycle that encompasses industry (i.e., real problems), research, development, and delivery. This chapter proposes applying the principles and lessons of the virtuous cycle to the development of data science applications; to the development of the data science discipline itself, for example, a data science method; and to the development of data science education; all focusing on the critical role of collaboration in data science research and management, thereby addressing the development challenges faced by the more than 150 Data Science Research Institutes (DSRIs) worldwide.

A generic system has been developed that can operate a large range of robotic systems. By design, a developed controller can be taken from numerical simulation, through Software/Hardware in the loop simulation to flight test, with no adjustment of code required. The flexibility and power of ROS was combined with the Robotic Systems toolbox from MATLAB/Simulink, Linux embedded systems and a commercially available autopilot. This affords the user a low cost, simple, highly flexible and reconfigurable system. Furthermore, by separating experimental controllers from the autopilot at the hardware level, flight safety is maintained as manual override is available at all times, regardless of faults in any experimental systems. This chapter details the system and demonstrates the functionality with two case studies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91590-6_4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In fact, it is predicted that fully autonomous cars will roam the streets by 2020. For an autonomous car to drive by itself, it needs to learn. A safe and economic way to teach a self-driving car to drive by itself is through simulation. However, current car simulators are based on closed world assumptions, where all possible events are already known as design time. Nevertheless, during the training of a self-driving car, it is impossible to account for all the possible events in the open world, where several unknown events may arise (i.e., events that were not considered at design time). Instead of carrying out particular adaptations for known context events in the closed world, the system architecture should evolve to safely reach a new state in the open world.

In particular, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly approaching critical areas such as medicine, autonomous vehicles, criminal justice, and financial markets. Such a trend is producing a growing AI-Human society entanglement. Thus, several concerns are raised around user acceptance of AI agents. Trust issues, mainly due to their lack of explainability, are the most relevant. In recent decades, the priority has been pursuing the optimal performance at the expenses of the interpretability. It led to remarkable achievements in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. However, the crucial questions driven by the social reluctance to accept AI-based decisions may lead to entirely new dynamics and technologies fostering explainability, authenticity, and user-centricity. This paper proposes a joint approach employing both blockchain technology (BCT) and explainability in the decision-making process of MAS. By doing so, current opaque decision-making processes can be made more transparent and secure and thereby trustworthy from the human user standpoint. Moreover, several case studies involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are discussed.

Deployment in a real environment necessitates the explainability and inspectability of the algorithms controlling the vehicle. Such insightful explanations are relevant not only for legal issues and insurance matters but also for engineers and developers in order to achieve provable functional quality guarantees. This applies to all scenarios where the results of deep networks control potentially life threatening machines. We suggest the use of a tiered approach, whose main component is a semantic segmentation model, over an end-to-end approach for an autonomous driving system. In order for a system to provide meaningful explanations for its decisions it is necessary to give an explanation about the semantics that it attributes to the complex sensory inputs that it perceives. In the context of high-dimensional visual input this attribution is done as a pixel-wise classification process that assigns an object class to every pixel in the image. This process is called semantic segmentation. We propose an architecture that delivers real-time viable segmentation performance and which conforms to the limitations in computational power that is available in production vehicles. The output of such a semantic segmentation model can be used as an input for an interpretable autonomous driving system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6_15,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In verification and validation of autonomous driving systems, there exists a gap between virtual validation and real road tests: Simulation provides an easy and efficient way to assess a system’s performance under a variety of environmental constraints, but is restricted to model assumptions and scenarios, which might ignore important aspects. Whereas expensive real road tests promise an unexpected environment for statistical evaluation of traffic scenarios, but lack of observability. Our setup for smart infrastructure is supposed to close the gap by tackling this issue by observing and providing reference data of traffic scenarios for application in different testing and evaluation settings. We present the approach of implementing a distributed intelligent infrastructure capable of handling traffic light states, road topology and especially information about locally observed traffic participants. The data is provided online via Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication for live testing and sensor range extension as well as offline via a backend for high-precision analysis and application of machine learning techniques. To obtain information about traffic participants, a camera based object tracking was realised. To cope with the high amount of information to be transmitted via V2X and to use the available bandwidth optimally, the standard for broadcasting vehicle information is modified by applying a form of data compression through prioritization.

IoT allows any device with an on-and-off switch to connect to the internet—a concept that has the ability to greatly change our lives and work. These modern systems collect inherently complex data streams due to the volume, velocity, value, variety, variability, and veracity of data, which leads to incremental growth in data traffic on networks and in the cloud. To fulfill the requirements of IoT, including geodistribution, low latency, location awareness, and mobility support, a new paradigm is proposed: edge computing. In edge computing, substantial computing and storage resources are placed at the edge of the network in mobile devices or sensors. The term “edge” is taken from network diagrams; normally, the edge of a network diagram represents the point at which data traffic enters or leaves the workable network. Using the concept of edge computing, an organization can shift huge amounts of data into processed data near the data origin, which helps to reduce data traffic in the network’s central repository (called the “cloud”). Edge computing uses a variety of data reduction techniques close to the data source at the network edge, including data pre-processing, local storage, and filtering. This approach can prevent some critical issues, such as I/O bottlenecks, storage and bandwidth limitations, data traffic increments, and high energy costs. A major advantage of edge computing is improvement of the request-response delay to milliseconds. Edge computing also supports security and network challenges. However, two major obstacles exist toward achieving the benefit of network-edge computing. First, the most efficient algorithms for data reduction in time series (one of the most common types of data in IoT) were developed to work posteriori upon big datasets, but they cannot make decisions for each incoming data item. Secondly, the state of the art lacks systems that can apply any of the possible data reduction methods without adding significant delays or major reconfigurations. Edge computing has also inherited some of the challenges of cloud computing, including data abstraction, naming, and programmability.

These industries are projected to become mainly data-driven, as the data acquisition and manipulation capabilities are becoming the main competencies in these industries. Hence, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) emerges not only as a key paradigm for distributed control of actuators but also solidifies the need for capturing and processing data. In this chapter, we discuss the use of visible light communications Visible Light Communication (VLC) ( VLC Visible Light Communication (VLC) ) within the IIoT paradigm. VLC considers the use of light sources and photodetectors operating in the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., light-emitting diodes) for communication purposes. Since VLC works in the visible band, it does not further congest the already over-crowded radio frequency Radio frequency (RF) bands. VLC is also secure, RF interference-free, low-cost, and energy efficient. Thus, it has been considered for utilization in many application areas such as intelligent transport Intelligent transport systems, indoor localization, and communication in RF-sensitive zones. In this chapter, while discussing the advantages and limitations of using VLC in IIoT systems, we further explore the possible utilization of bi-directional LED Light Emitting Diodes (LED) to LED communication within this scope for very low-cost communication devices. Finally, we discuss current and possible future applications of VLC in the IIoT context, identifying the following as potential future applications: LED-Based IIoT sensor data transmissions, LED beaconing LED beaconing for localization and signaling, wearable VLC devices for safety, VLC for ubiquitous computing Ubiquitous computing , VLC-supported augmented reality Augmented reality , VLC for smart farming Smart farming , VLC-assisted energy load scheduling, VLC-supported industrial Internet of Underwater Things, VLC-offloaded telecom services, and VLC usage in the transportation industry Transportation industry .",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24892-5_8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The robots as an ensemble form into a multi-robot system (MRS), which can be utilized for many applications where a single robot is not efficient or feasible. MRS can be used for a wide variety of application domains such as military, agriculture, smart home, disaster relief, etc. It offers higher scalability, reliability, and efficiency as compared to single-robot system. However, it is nontrivial to develop and deploy MRS applications due to many challenging issues such as distributed computation, collaboration, coordination, and real-time integration of robotic modules and services. To make the development of multi-robot applications easier, researchers have proposed various middleware architectures to provide programming abstractions that help in managing the complexity and heterogeneity of hardware and applications. With the help of middleware, an application developer can concentrate on the high-level logic of applications instead of worrying about low-level hardware and network details. In this chapter, we survey state of the art in both distributed MRS and middleware being used for developing their applications. We provide a taxonomy that can be used to classify the MRS middleware and analyze existing middleware functionalities and features. Our work will help researchers and developers in the systematic understanding of middleware for MRS and in selecting or developing the appropriate middleware based on the application requirements.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92384-0_18,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To reduce the residual risk for unexpected DNN behaviour and provide evidence for their trustworthy operation, DNNs should be thoroughly tested. The DeepFault whitebox DNN testing approach presented in our paper addresses this challenge by employing suspiciousness measures inspired by fault localization to establish the hit spectrum of neurons and identify suspicious neurons whose weights have not been calibrated correctly and thus are considered responsible for inadequate DNN performance. DeepFault also uses a suspiciousness-guided algorithm to synthesize new inputs, from correctly classified inputs, that increase the activation values of suspicious neurons. Our empirical evaluation on several DNN instances trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows that DeepFault is effective in identifying suspicious neurons.

These incidents, although often rare, can involve chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear or explosive (CBRNE) substances and can be of high consequence.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles, sensors, humans, and infrastructure, thereby improving decision making based on the information received from its surroundings. However, for these applications to work correctly, information needs to be authenticated, verified and trustworthy. The most important messages in these networks are safety messages which are periodically broadcasted for various safety and traffic efficiency related applications such as collision avoidance, intersection warning, and traffic jam detection. However, the primary concern is guaranteeing the trustworthiness of the data in the presence of dishonest and misbehaving peers. Misbehavior detection is still in their infancy and requires a lot of effort to be integrated into the system. An attacker who is imitating “ghost vehicles” on the road, by broadcasting false position information in the safety messages, must be detected and revoked permanently from the VANETs. The goal of our work is analyzing safety messages and detecting false position information transmitted by the misbehaving nodes. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) techniques on VeReMi dataset to detect the misbehavior. We demonstrated that the ML-based approach enables high-quality detection of modeled attack patterns.

The application selected to demonstrate the problems and potential solutions is in the context of autonomous driving. The specific problem addressed is of a machine instructed by human word commands to execute the task of parking two manned or unmanned cars in a two-car garage using CWW. We divide the interaction process into two steps: (1) feasibility verification and (2) execution. In order to fulfill the task, we begin with verifications of feasibility in terms of assessing whether the garage is unoccupied, checking general ballpark dimensions, inspecting irregular shapes, and classifying the cars that need to be parked, in terms of size, types of vehicles, ranges of acceptable tolerances needed if the cars are manned or not, and means of collision avoidance. The execution of the autonomous driving part is directed by sensory non-numeric fuzzy information that indicates distances from walls or obstacles. The execution algorithm uses a sequence of driving instructions aimed at using the available space in a simple and efficient way without resorting to elaborate numerical calculations, such as making sure that the car is within 2 inches of the wall.

Failure of such devices can cause significant costs, e.g., in automotive factories. Established predictive maintenance approaches usually require deep integration with the specific machine. Such approaches are not practically feasible because of technical, legal and financial restrictions. A non-intrusive, lightweight and generic solution approach is desired. (b) Action taken : A solution concept was developed which, at its heart, is based on deep learning algorithms that monitor sound sequences captured from a microphone, analyze them and return classification results for use in further steps of a control loop, such as planning actions and execution steps. We named this approach the ‘Sound Detective’ and it was evaluated by retrofitting a coffee machine using simple microphones to capture production sounds. The sound sequences are subsequently analyzed using neural networks developed in Keras and TensorFlow. During prototyping, multiple kinds of neural networks and architectures were tested and the experiment was realized with two different kinds of coffee machines to validate the generalizability of the solution to different platforms.

The technical realization relies on cheap commodity hardware and open-source software, demonstrating the applicability of existing technologies and the feasibility of the implementation. Especially, it was described that the proposed approach can be applied to solve predictive maintenance tasks.

Typically static analysis with Abstract Interpretation or SAT solvers approaches are applied to neural networks and leverages the important progress of formal methods over the last decades. Such approaches estimate bounds on the perturbation of the inputs and formally guarantee the same DNN prediction within these bounds. However formal methods over DNN for image perception system have only been applied to simple image attacks (2D rotation, brightness). In this work, we extend the definition of Lower and Upper Bounds to assess the robustness of a DNN perception system against more generic attacks. We propose a general method to verify object recognition systems using Abstract Interpretation theory.

Researchers have proposed some methods to craft adversarial examples for studying security risk in object detectors. All these methods require modifying pixels inside target objects. Some modifications are substantial and target objects are significantly distorted. In this paper, an algorithm which derives an adversarial signal placing around the border of target objects to fool objector detectors is proposed. Computationally, the algorithm seeks a border around target objects to mislead Faster R-CNN to produce a very large bounding box and finally decease its confidence to target objects. Using stop sign as a target object, adversarial borders with four different sizes are generated and evaluated on 77 videos, including five in-car videos for digital attacks and 72 videos for physical attacks.

Later, the vehicles can relay the data on the destination point.

Shooting without control by a human operator has military advantages, but also disadvantages – human understanding of the situation and control of events would suffer. Beyond this, compliance with the law of armed conflict is in question. Would it be ethical to allow a machine to take a human life? The increased pace of battle may overburden human understanding and decision making and lead to uncontrolled escalation. An international campaign as well as IT, robotics and AI professionals and enterprises are calling for an international ban of AWS. States have discussed about limitations in the UN context, but no consensus has evolved so far. Germany has argued for a ban of fully autonomous weapons, but has not joined the countries proposing an AWS ban, and is using a problematic definition. An international ban could comprise a prohibition of AWS and a requirement that each use of force must be under meaningful human control (with very few exceptions). If remotely controlled uninhabited weapon systems remain allowed, a-priori verification that they cannot attack under computer control is virtually impossible. Compliance could be proved after the fact by secure records of all communication and sensor data and the actions of the human operator. The AI and robotics communities could make significant contributions in teaching and by engaging the public and decision makers.

From a formal point of view, the employed intelligent sensor actuator systems (ISAS) constituting such intelligent systems combine three different technologies: control systems, distributed systems, and learning and reasoning. While each of the parent domains features tested and proven verification methods, simply combining the tasks unfortunately leads to a combinatorial explosion of complexity. This paper presents an overview and classification of currently employed techniques for handling ISAS in terms of: cyber-physical systems, intelligent autonomous robots, or intelligent agents. The article argues that each of the three classical perspectives misses one important characteristic of ISAS and proposes to combine the three for a full solution.

Our main insight in this paper is that a robot’s path planning times can be significantly reduced if it can refer to previous maneuvers it used to avoid obstacles during earlier missions, and adapt that information to avoid obstacles during its current navigation. We propose an online path planning algorithm called LearnerRRT that utilizes a pattern matching technique called Sample Consensus Initial Alignment (SAC-IA) in combination with an experience-based learning technique to adapt obstacle boundary patterns encountered in previous environments to the current scenario followed by corresponding adaptations in the obstacle-avoidance paths. Our proposed algorithm LearnerRRT works as a learning-based reactive path planning technique which enables robots to improve their overall path planning performance by locally improving maneuvers around commonly encountered obstacle patterns by accessing previously accumulated environmental information. We have conducted several experiments in simulations and hardware to verify the performance of the LearnerRRT algorithm and compared it with a state-of-the-art sampling-based planner. LearnerRRT on average takes approximately 10 % of the planning time and 14 % of the total time taken by the sampling-based planner to solve the same navigation task based on simulation results and takes only 33 % of the planning time, 46 % of total time and 95 % of total distance compared to the sampling-based planner based on our hardware results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-017-0739-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The theory explains the contrast between successful and unsuccessful cases of sustained adaptability for systems that serve human purposes. Sustained adaptability refers to the ability to continue to adapt to changing environments, stakeholders, demands, contexts, and constraints (in effect, to adapt how the system in question adapts). The key new concept at the heart of the theory is graceful extensibility. Graceful extensibility is the opposite of brittleness, where brittleness is a sudden collapse or failure when events push the system up to and beyond its boundaries for handling changing disturbances and variations. As the opposite of brittleness, graceful extensibility is the ability of a system to extend its capacity to adapt when surprise events challenge its boundaries. The theory is presented in the form of a set of 10 proto-theorems derived from just two assumptions—in the adaptive universe, resources are always finite and change continues. The theory contains three subsets of fundamentals: managing the risk of saturation, networks of adaptive units, and outmaneuvering constraints. The theory attempts to provide a formal base and common language that characterizes how complex systems sustain and fail to sustain adaptability as demands change.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10669-018-9708-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Rank ordered data are often collected in stated preference surveys where respondents are asked to rank hypothetical alternatives (rather than choose a single alternative) to better understand their relative preferences. Despite the widespread interest in collecting data on and modeling people’s preferences for choice alternatives, rank-ordered data are rarely collected in travel surveys and very little progress has been made in the ability to rigorously model such data and obtain reliable parameter estimates. This paper presents a rank ordered probit modeling approach that overcomes limitations associated with prior approaches in analyzing rank ordered data. The efficacy of the rank ordered probit modeling methodology is demonstrated through an application of the model to understand preferences for alternative configurations of autonomous vehicles (AV) using the 2015 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study survey data set. The methodology offers behaviorally intuitive model results with a variety of socio-economic and demographic characteristics, including age, gender, household income, education, employment and household structure, significantly influencing preference for alternative configurations of AV adoption, ownership, and shared usage. The ability to estimate rank ordered probit models offers a pathway for better utilizing rank ordered data to understand preferences and recognize that choices may not be absolute in many instances.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-018-9945-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They outline the technical challenges in applying machine learning to different types of biological and biomedical data and go on to discuss the challenges in implementing these approaches in the clinical realm, in drug discovery programs and within regulatory agencies. Deep learning is beginning to impact biological research and biomedical applications as a result of its ability to integrate vast datasets, learn arbitrarily complex relationships and incorporate existing knowledge. Already, deep learning models can predict, with varying degrees of success, how genetic variation alters cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, which small molecules will modulate the activity of therapeutically relevant proteins, and whether radiographic images are indicative of disease. However, the flexibility of deep learning creates new challenges in guaranteeing the performance of deployed systems and in establishing trust with stakeholders, clinicians and regulators, who require a rationale for decision making.

If the camera view gets obstructed by the leaves, the video will fail to be used in vehicle tracking and recognition. It is required that the traffic video surveillance systems run self-checking in order to evaluate if the camera view is blocked by leaves or not. In view of this, a two-step learning framework is proposed in this paper to automatically determine whether the video is leaf degraded or leaf free. First, the proposed framework exploits the convolutional neural network to learn the discriminative features of leaf particles. Then the trained model is used to detect candidate leaf patches in the image. Second, a probabilistic approach is used to pool decisions of each candidate leaf patch to generate final leaf detection result in the video. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively detect leaves in real-world traffic surveillance video.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11045-017-0540-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The main goal is to optimize the upper level problem which has another optimization problem as a constraint. The latter is called the lower level problem. In this way, the evaluation of each upper level solution requires finding an (near) optimal solution to the corresponding lower level problem, which is computationally very expensive. Many real world applications are bi-level by nature, ranging from logistics to software engineering. Further, proposed bi-level approaches have been restricted to solve linear BLOPs. This fact has attracted the evolutionary computation community to tackle such complex problems and many interesting works have recently been proposed. Unfortunately, most of these works are restricted to the continuous case.

Understanding how performance varies in terms of feature selection is key for selecting appropriate configurations that meet a set of given requirements. Due to a huge configuration space and the possibly high cost of performance measurement, it is usually not feasible to explore the entire configuration space of a configurable system exhaustively. It is thus a major challenge to accurately predict performance based on a small sample of measured system variants. To address this challenge, we propose a data-efficient learning approach, called DECART, that combines several techniques of machine learning and statistics for performance prediction of configurable systems. DECART builds, validates, and determines a prediction model based on an available sample of measured system variants.

In particular, DECART achieves a prediction accuracy of 90% or higher based on a small sample, whose size is linear in the number of features.

In vehicle-based safety systems, it is more desirable to prevent an accident than to reduce severity of injuries. Critical traffic problems such as accidents and traffic congestion require the development of new transportation systems. Research in perceptual and human factors assessment is needed for relevant and correct display of this information for maximal road traffic safety as well as optimal driver comfort. One of the solutions to prevent accidents is to provide information on the surrounding environment of the driver. Augmented Reality Head-Up Display (AR-HUD) can facilitate a new form of dialogue between the vehicle and the driver; and enhance ITS by superimposing surrounding traffic information on the users view and keep drivers view on roads. In this paper, we propose a fast deep-learning-based object detection approaches for identifying and recognizing road obstacles types, as well as interpreting and predicting complex traffic situations. A single convolutional neural network predicts region of interest and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. We also investigated potential costs and benefits of using dynamic conformal AR cues in improving driving safety. A new AR-HUD approach to create real-time interactive traffic animations was introduced in terms of types of obstacle, rules for placement and visibility, and projection of these on an in-vehicle display. The novelty of our approach is that both global and local context information are integrated into a unified framework to distinguish the ambiguous detection outcomes, enhance ITS by superimposing surrounding traffic information on the users view and keep drivers view on roads.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-017-5054-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we develop a framework for environmental boundary tracking and estimation in partially observable environments which are processed in an online manner. Dedicated sensors mounted on the vehicle are considered to be capable of on-the-spot field intensity measurements. Focusing on the limited resources of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), it is important to track an unknown boundary in a fast manner. Therefore, we present a motion planning strategy that enables a single UAV to estimate the boundary of a given target area while minimizing the exploration cost. To do so, we improve the conventional position controller based framework by integrating a noise canceling filter and a novel adaptive crossing angle correction scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in three different simulated environments.

To this end, we create an FOD image dataset consisting of images from the runways of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and the campus of our research institute.

We demonstrate that these alignment frameworks can be represented as utility functions, but that the widely used Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) paradigm provides insufficient support for such multiobjective decision-making. We show that a Multiobjective Maximum Expected Utility paradigm based on the combination of vector utilities and non-linear action–selection can overcome many of the issues which limit MEU’s effectiveness in implementing aligned AI.

In situations where the environment is reasonably known and/or predictable, pre-planning these control changes could relieve robot operators of the additional task of deciding when and how to switch. Such a strategy provides a clear division of labour between the automation and the human operator(s) before the job even begins, allowing for individual responsibilities to be known ahead of time, limiting confusion and allowing rest breaks to be planned. Assigned Responsibility is a new form of adjustable autonomy-based teleoperation that allows the selective inclusion of automated control elements at key stages of a robot operation plan’s execution. Progression through these stages is controlled by automatic goal accomplishment tracking. An implementation is evaluated through engineering tests and a usability study, demonstrating the viability of this approach and offering insight into its potential applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41315-018-0043-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

AVs today are network-enabled. Soon they will be able to communicate with other vehicles and structures in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and distant vehicles and structures (for congestion management). Most AV concepts employ a network connection to the cloud, other vehicles, and built-up structures.

For example, people living in low-income areas may have higher levels of exposure to an environmental hazard and also higher levels of some adverse health effect than people living in wealthier areas. Yet this observed association, no matter how strong, consistent, statistically significant, biologically plausible, and well documented by multiple independent teams, does not necessarily tell a policy maker anything about whether or by how much a proposed costly reduction in exposure would reduce adverse health effects. Perhaps only increasing income, or something that income can buy, would reduce adverse health effects. Or maybe factors that cannot be changed by policy interventions increase both the probability of living in low-income areas and the probability of adverse health effects. Whatever the truth is about opportunities to improve health by changing policy variables, it typically cannot be determined by studying correlations, regression coefficients, relative risks, or other measures of association between exposures and health effects (Pearl 2009). Observed associations between variables can contain both causal and non-causal (“spurious”) components. In general, the effects of policy changes on outcomes of interest can only be predicted and evaluated correctly by modeling the network of causal relationships by which effects of exogenous changes propagate among variables.

Our framework allows constructing stochastic models using generalized master equations , which can be viewed as a nonparametric model capturing the dynamic evolution of the probabilities of system variables with time.

At the same time, the computational complexity and resource consumption of these networks continue to increase. This poses a significant challenge to the deployment of such networks, especially in real-time applications or on resource-limited devices. Thus, network acceleration has become a hot topic within the deep learning community. As for hardware implementation of deep neural networks, a batch of accelerators based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in network acceleration, compression, and accelerator design from both algorithm and hardware points of view. Specifically, we provide a thorough analysis of each of the following topics: network pruning, low-rank approximation, network quantization, teacher–student networks, compact network design, and hardware accelerators. Finally, we introduce and discuss a few possible future directions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/FITEE.1700789,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The LDM has been semantically enhanced to allow for an elaborate domain model that is captured by a mobility ontology, and for queries over data streams that cater for semantic concepts and spatial relationships. We show how this approach can be extended to address a wider range of use cases in the three C-ITS scenarios traffic statistics , events detection , and advanced driving assistance systems . We define for them requirements derived from necessary domain-specific features and report, based on them, on the extension of our query language with temporal relations, delaying, numeric predictions and trajectory predictions.

Today’s vehicles are evolving from computers-on-wheels towards the internet of everything and data-on-wheels. Automotive systems currently exhibit increased levels of automation as well as ever tighter integration with other vehicles, traffic infrastructure, and cloud services. As a result, a shift of the value creation in the automotive domain toward information and communications technology (ICT) domain can be observed over the years. This can be perceived as boon or bane - it greatly increases complexity and uncertainty, but at the same time opens up new opportunities for realizing innovative safety functions. Novel advanced driver assistance systems features or automated driving functions drive the need for advances and novel safety and security solutions, while highly relying on existing components developed in the traditional automotive development landscape. Novel constraints coming from highly automated and distributed driving functionalities which can not be supervised by drivers must therefore be considered as an integral part of the development of modern vehicles. But within these terms a lack of experience with development approaches for automated driving and safety engineering of such automated functionalities still exist. In the current phase, more and more highly automated driving functions become integrated in conventional vehicles relying on safety components developed for conventional passenger vehicle usage. This paper will concentrate on the constraints and additional points to be considered when developing or integrating existing safety-related components developed as SEooC in the context of highly automated vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-97925-0_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The organic evolution of IoT requires the consideration of three dimensions: scale, organization, and context. These dimensions are particularly relevant in Ultra Large Scale Systems (ULSS), of which autonomous vehicles is a prime example. Fog Computing is well positioned to support contextual awareness and communication, critical for ULSS. The design and orchestration of ULSS require fresh approaches, new organizing principles. A recent paper proposed Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors (HEB), an architecture that builds on established concepts of emergent behaviors and hierarchical decomposition and organization. HEB’s local rules induce emergent behaviors, i.e., useful behaviors not explicitly programmed. In this chapter we take a first step to validate HEB concepts through the study of two basic self-driven car “primitives”: exiting a platoon formation, and maneuvering in anticipation of obstacles beyond the range of on-board sensors.

Advanced IT systems have enhanced inventory and demand visibility and facilitated communications with global partners and customers, while transportation technologies have improved the speed and efficiency necessary to transport goods globally. However, dramatic changes in both of these areas are on the horizon. The emergence of new technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will force the next big wave of changes in global supply chains. While some of these technologies have been adopted by individual firms, many questions remain concerning how these technologies will drive new supply chain policies, business models, and regulations in the future. To illustrate, while technologies such as autonomous vehicles and IoT facilitate supply chain efficiency and transparency, they also increase the risk of compromising data security. In this chapter, we offer a brief overview of each of these emerging technologies and summarize the impact on the supply chain.

Since every single source (e.g., camera, digital map, etc.) can fail in certain situations, several independent sources need to be combined. Moreover, the reliability of each source strongly depends on environmental conditions, e.g., existence or visibility of lane markings. Thus, we introduce a concept of estimating and incorporating reliability into the fusion. First, a new sensor-independent error metric is applied to assess the quality of the estimated ego-lanes based on the angle deviation. Secondly, we deploy a boosting algorithm to select the highly discriminant features among the extracted information. Based on the selected features, we apply different classifiers to learn the reliabilities of the sources.

A key insight of this paper is that the network achieves a sub-pixel matching precision than is a magnitude higher than those of traditional stereo matching approaches. This allows us to achieve real-time performance by using a very low resolution cost volume that encodes all the information needed to achieve high disparity precision. Spatial precision is achieved by employing a learned edge-aware upsampling function. Our model uses a Siamese network to extract features from the left and right image. A first estimate of the disparity is computed in a very low resolution cost volume, then hierarchically the model re-introduces high-frequency details through a learned upsampling function that uses compact pixel-to-pixel refinement networks. Leveraging color input as a guide, this function is capable of producing high-quality edge-aware output.

Unprecedented opportunities exist it is claimed in the rapid expansion of creative innovation and entrepreneurship with a social as well as economic purpose. New product technology platforms and open source software have reduced the technological barriers and risks to product innovation. The evolution of big data combined and powerful data algorithms creates the capacity to discern patterns in complexity integral to the creation of new knowledge. Big data tools are being applied across all scientific disciplines and industries and businesses.

However, like most data-driven methods, existing deep stereo matching networks suffer from some well-known drawbacks such as requiring large amount of labeled training data, and that their performances are fundamentally limited by the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that takes a continuous (possibly previously unseen) stereo video as input, and directly predicts a depth-map at each frame without a pre-training process, and without the need of ground-truth depth-maps as supervision. Thanks to the recurrent nature (provided by two convolutional-LSTM blocks), our network is able to memorize and learn from its past experiences, and modify its inner parameters (network weights) to adapt to previously unseen or unfamiliar environments. This suggests a remarkable generalization ability of the net, making it applicable in an open world setting. Our method works robustly with changes in scene content, image statistics, and lighting and season conditions etc . By extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method seamlessly adapts between different scenarios.

Although it is now possible to use GPS-tracking to record people’s movement behaviour over a longer period, there is still a lack of computational methods which allow to detect and evaluate such behaviour change processes in the resulting datasets. In this study, we propose a data mining method for describing individual persons’ mobility behaviour change processes based on their movement trajectories and clustering participants based on the similarity of these behavioural adaptations. We further propose to use a decision tree classifier to semantically explain the derived clusters in a human-interpretable form.

The public discourse as well as discourse among AI researchers leads to at least two problems: a confusion about the notion of ‘autonomy’ that induces people to attribute to machines something comparable to human autonomy, and a ‘sociotechnical blindness’ that hides the essential role played by humans at every stage of the design and deployment of an AI system.

The key problem is to guide the car to the destination in real-time with a safe and obstacle free path in real-world environments. We propose an innovative self-driving car navigation approach that incorporates a VFH (Vector Field Histogram) local path planner adapted for modern 3D laser scanners and a global path planner using satellite positioning and digital map along with a custom built PID controller (Proportional Integral Derivative controller). Since classical path planning methods such as VFH are often used on small robots with ultrasonic rangefinders or in simulation based environments, we applied the VFH method to a real self-driving car with two different LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) configurations. The quantitative results from extensive experiments indicate that the developed VFH method with the modern real-time 3D LiDAR generally outperform the conventional LIDAR in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. In addition, the tracks produced by 3D LIDAR are more convergent, smooth and consistent than the other configuration. The maximum position deviation for the VFH with 3D LiDAR is 0.28 m and −0.16 m while the deviation for the other low-cost solution is 0.88 m and −0.49 m respectively. The global path planner can provide an accuracy of within 1 meter most of the time. The proposed approach is successfully implemented and tested on our self-driving car which took part in the national self-driving car competitions in recent years, and ranked No.3 and 4. in the future challenge 2014 self-driving car competition in China.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-016-4211-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Among the several applications of our solution are sensing and coverage of large corridor-based buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and the optimal placement of service vehicles in the streets of a big city. The representation of the environment as a topological map transforms the original two or three-dimensional problem into a one-dimensional, simplified problem, thus reducing the computational cost of the solution. Moreover, each robot can reach its final position by simply following a sequence of intuitive, human-like commands, without the need for global metric localization, which also simplifies robot control.

Robust traversability estimation in unknown environments would allow the vehicle or the robot to devise control and planning strategies to maximize their effectiveness. In this study, we present a self-supervised on-line learning architecture to estimate the traversability in complex and unknown outdoor environments. The proposed approach builds a model by clustering appearance data using the newly proposed incremental nonparametric Bayesian clustering algorithm. The clusters are then classified as being either traversable or non-traversable. Because our approach effectively groups unknown regions with similar properties, while the vehicle is in motion without human intervention, the vehicle can be deployed to new environments by automatically adapting to changing environmental conditions.

Current approaches to norms in multi-agent systems tend either to simply make prohibited actions unavailable, or to provide a set of rules (principles) which the agent is obliged to follow, either as part of its design or to avoid sanctions and punishments. In this paper we argue for the position that agents should be equipped with the ability to reason about a system’s norms, by reasoning about the social and moral values that norms are designed to serve; that is, perform the sort of moral reasoning we expect of humans. In particular we highlight the need for such reasoning when circumstances are such that the rules should arguably be broken, so that the reasoning can guide agents in deciding whether to comply with the norms and, if violation is desirable, how best to violate them. One approach to enabling this is to make use of an argumentation scheme based on values and designed for practical reasoning: arguments for and against actions are generated using this scheme and agents choose between actions based on their preferences over these values. Moral reasoning then requires that agents have an acceptable set of values and an acceptable ordering on their values. We first discuss how this approach can be used to think about and justify norms in general, and then discuss how this reasoning can be used to think about when norms should be violated, and the form this violation should take. We illustrate how value based reasoning can be used to decide when and how to violate a norm using a road traffic example. We also briefly consider what makes an ordering on values acceptable, and how such an ordering might be determined.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10506-017-9194-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the high levels of uncertainty and vulnerability in human life and the open-ended nature of problems that humans are facing, no matter how intelligent machines are, they are unable to completely replace humans. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive capabilities or human-like cognitive models into AI systems to develop a new form of AI, that is, hybrid-augmented intelligence. This form of AI or machine intelligence is a feasible and important developing model. Hybrid-augmented intelligence can be divided into two basic models: one is human-in-the-loop augmented intelligence with human-computer collaboration, and the other is cognitive computing based augmented intelligence, in which a cognitive model is embedded in the machine learning system. This survey describes a basic framework for human-computer collaborative hybrid-augmented intelligence, and the basic elements of hybrid-augmented intelligence based on cognitive computing. These elements include intuitive reasoning, causal models, evolution of memory and knowledge, especially the role and basic principles of intuitive reasoning for complex problem solving, and the cognitive learning framework for visual scene understanding based on memory and reasoning.

This chapter provides an introduction to key AI technologies, investigates to what extent they involve anticipatory processes, and explores the consequences of such anticipation on the predictability of AI systems for humans. Our analysis suggests that the relationship between human and AI anticipation is complementary - the more pronounced the anticipatory capabilities of the AI system, the harder it may be for humans to anticipate their behaviour.

The platform is designed to maximize the energy efficiency in sensors applications by exploiting the Cortex Arm M4 to achieve ultra-low power processing and power management, and enables the multi-core processor to provide additional computational power for near-sensor data centric processing (i.e. accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification) increasing energy efficiency.

TeLEx finds the value of the unknown parameters such that the synthesized STL property is satisfied by all the provided traces and it is tight . This requirement of tightness is essential to generating interesting properties when only positive examples are provided and there is no option to actively query the dynamical system to discover the boundaries of legal behavior.

This chapter about the formation of an organization and its conscious mind as well as its subconscious mind follows the analogy to the processes of the human brain as source of creativity and innovation: the perception, the cognition, the knowledge and the processes of decision-making and interaction. Innovation in itself and the prerequisites for successful innovation are the basis for guiding design principles presented in this chapter. They are then expanded to include aspects of organizational culture thus leading to practical guiding principles (GP) for the design of the organizational structure, the process structure and the infrastructure as parts of the subconscious mind of organizations as well as the embedding of the organization in the respective business area and society. The development of an integrated management system as framework for quick and flexible action is recommended. The extended perception, the extended—implicit and explicit—knowledge and the consciously and disciplined, semi-automatic or automatically derived findings, conclusions and decisions shape the subconscious mind of organizations and the interface to their conscious mind. The “new thinking” of an organization in the light of new technological options such as Artificial Intelligence, automated decision making etc. as well as coping with the uncertainties and upheavals in the environment of the organizations require time, effort and discipline. It is therefore one of the key management tasks to face these developments and challenges actively and not take the “easy way” to leave this to the daily business or simply “let it happen”. The sustainability and long-term existence of an organization is being massively affected by the managerial approach chosen. Finally humans hopefully will still be—in terms of governance—“in the driver’s seat”. If we do it right, future organizations will not constitute as “Artificial Intelligences”—as part of Ray Kurzweils “singularity”—, but they will develop and evolve in a kind of “hybrid intelligence”. Concerning the people and their relationship to the structures, organizations and new technologies we should basically follow the principle: “People do not serve structures but the organizations, their infrastructures and their systems serve the people”.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53618-7_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This allows us to rely on synthetic data for training, eliminating the need for labelled images. Our method achieves competitive performance on three horizon estimation benchmark datasets. We further highlight some additional use cases for which our vanishing point detection algorithm can be used.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66709-6_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we first introduce the notion of dynamic worst-case execution time (dWCET), which forms a new perspective that could help a system to predict potential timing failures and optimize resource allocations. We then have a comprehensive review of trend prediction methods. In the evaluation, we make a comparative study of dWCET trend prediction. Four prediction methods, combined with three data selection processes, are applied in an evaluation framework.

In this work, a distributed probabilistic multi-agent algorithm inspired by the bacterium foraging behavior is presented. The novelty of the algorithm lies in being capable of tracking and mapping a spatio-temporal quantity without the need of machine learning, estimation algorithms or future planning. This is unlike most current techniques that rely heavily on machine learning to estimate the distribution as well as the profile of spatio-temporal quantities. The experimental studies carried out in this work show that the algorithm works well by following the concentration gradient of a dynamic plume created under diffusive conditions. Furthermore, the algorithm is inherently capable of finding the source of a diffusive spatio-temporal quantity as well as performing environmental exploration. It is computationally tractable for simple agents, shown to adapt to its environment and can deal successfully with noise in sensor readings as well as in robot dynamics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1672-6529(16)60339-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, this requires challenging intervention operations to be carried out persistently, thus minimizing human supervision and ensuring a reliable vehicle behaviour under unexpected perturbances and failures. This paper describes a system to perform autonomous intervention—in particular valve-turning—using the concept of persistent autonomy. To achieve this goal, we build a framework that integrates different disciplines, involving mechatronics, localization, control, machine learning and planning techniques, bearing in mind robustness in the implementation of all of them. We present experiments in a water tank, conducted with Girona 500 I-AUV in the context of a multiple intervention mission. Results show how the vehicle sets several valve panel configurations throughout the experiment while handling different errors, either spontaneous or induced. Finally, we report the insights gained from our experience and we discuss the main aspects that must be matured and refined in order to promote the future development of intervention autonomous vehicles that can operate, persistently, in subsea facilities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-015-9511-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In cases where the seafloor depth is greater than the DVL bottom-lock range, localizing between the surface and the seafloor presents a localization problem since both GPS and DVL observations are unavailable in the mid-water column. This work proposes a solution to this problem that exploits the fact that current profile layers of the water column are near constant over short time scales (in the scale of minutes). Using observations of these currents obtained with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler mode of the DVL during descent, along with data from other sensors, the method discussed herein constrains position error.

One implication of complexity is that road traffic collisions have become an unwelcome but unavoidable part of human life. One of the major causes of collisions is the human factor. While car manufacturers have been focusing on developing feasible solutions for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles to replace or assist human drivers, the proposed solutions have been designed only for individual vehicles. The road traffic, however, is an interaction-oriented system including complex flows. Such a system requires a complex systems approach to solving this problem as it involves considering not only pedestrians, road environment, but also road traffic which can include multiple vehicles. Recent research has demonstrated that large-scale autonomous vehicular traffic can be better modeled using a collective approach as proposed in the form of vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS) such as given by Li et al.

Human-inspired robot competitions, of which the majority are sports contests, quickly move through platform development to focus on problem solving and test through game play. Task-based challenges attempt to attract participants by presenting a high aim for a robotic system.

A malfunctioning or compromised component in such a CPS can lead to costly consequences, especially in the context of public infrastructure. In this short paper, we argue for the importance of constructing invariants (or models) of the physical behaviour exhibited by CPS, motivated by their applications to the control, monitoring, and attestation of components. To achieve this despite the inherent complexity of CPS, we propose a new technique for learning invariants that combines machine learning with ideas from mutation testing. We present a preliminary study on a water treatment system that suggests the efficacy of this approach, propose strategies for establishing confidence in the correctness of invariants, then summarise some research questions and the steps we are taking to investigate them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48989-6_10,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While the primary focus of the discussion is on verification and validation in model-based systems engineering it also touches upon testing for certification, establishing regulations, public investment, and research and development. A reference architecture for automated driving coordinates designs at the vehicle and system levels for increased interoperability among components and improved efficiency. A model-based systems engineering approach exploits automated vehicle systems domain models as a primary means of information exchange to help manage the complexity and provide analytical support for efficient architecting, design, verification, and validation. These models support the testing and evaluation process for functional safety design and certification. Finally, demonstration pilots, operational testing, and natural use testing, combined with system design artifacts, are critical to public and regulatory acceptance of the virtual driver. Although safety must be assured, the primary challenge is how to make such assurances without relying on a human driver and vouching for the virtual driver under all allowable driving situations and conditions.

It is difficult to say just how much each change will affect the amount and type of travel in the future, especially given the amount of uncertainty there is regarding the trajectory of these changes and their effects. The authors examined changes that are likely to affect transportation behaviors in the future, developed a “fuzzy cognitive map” (FCM) of the relationships, and used the FCM model to investigate the effects of those relationships. The results of the study show that FCM models offer a promising method for transportation planners to enhance their ability to reason about system effects when quantitative information is limited and uncertain.

Current methods of car hypothesis such as symmetry or shadow based method work only with non-occluded cars. In this paper, we proposed an approach to car detection and counting using a new method of car hypothesis based on car windshield appearance which is the most feasible cue to hypothesize cars in occlusion situations. In hypothesis stage, Hough transformation is used to detect trapezoid-like regions where a car’s windshield could be located, and then candidate car regions are estimated by the windshield region and its size. In verification stage, HOG descriptor and a well-collected dataset are used to train a linear SVM classifier for detecting cars at a high accuracy rate. Then, a tracking process based on Kalman filter is used to track the movement of detected cars in consecutive frames of traffic videos, followed by rule-based reasoning for counting decision. Experimental results on real traffic videos showed that the system is able to detect, track and count multiple cars including occlusion in dense traffic flow in real-time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12555-014-0229-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the explosive growth in mobile devices and communications network capability has created a fertile ground for new developments in transportation-oriented sensing. It is the purpose of this chapter to first take a look back at extant infrastructure-based sensors and then move on to positioning, communications, participatory sensing and finally data management issues.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7129-5_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper discusses a proposed new framework that allows agent technology to be used in conjunction with a virtual environment to provide a human controller with an effective visualisation of the distribution of a collection of autonomous objects, in our case, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) so that they can be managed in a way that allows them to successfully complete the task in the minimum possible time. It is our contention that to do this effectively there needs to be two-way initiation of verbal conversations, but that it is not necessary for the system to completely understand the conversations required. An example scenario is presented that illustrates how such a system would be used in practice, illustrating how a single human can communicate with a swarm of semi-autonomous actors verbally and envisage their activities in a swarm based on the visual cues provided within the virtual environment. An agent-based solution is proposed that meets the requirements and provides a command station that can manage a search using a collection of UAVs effectively.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36444-0_4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Irregular Triangular Meshes (ITMs) are used for representing the environment, providing an accurate, yet compact, spatial representation.

Many researchers have already equipped their robots with wireless communication capabilities, stimulated by the observation that multi-robot systems tend to have several advantages over their single-robot counterparts. Typically, this integration of wireless communication is tackled in a quite pragmatic manner, only a few authors presented novel Robotic Ad Hoc Network (RANET) protocols that were designed specifically with robotic use cases in mind. This is in sharp contrast with the domain of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). This observation is the starting point of this paper. If the results of previous efforts focusing on VANET protocols could be reused in the RANET domain, this could lead to rapid progress in the field of networked robots. To investigate this possibility, this paper provides a thorough overview of the related work in the domain of robotic and vehicular ad hoc networks. Based on this information, an exhaustive list of requirements is defined for both types. It is concluded that the most significant difference lies in the fact that VANET protocols are oriented towards low throughput messaging, while RANET protocols have to support high throughput media streaming as well. Although not always with equal importance, all other defined requirements are valid for both protocols. This leads to the conclusion that cross-fertilization between them is an appealing approach for future RANET research. To support such developments, this paper concludes with the definition of an appropriate working plan.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-012-0598-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We introduce a new evolutionary computation-based approach using which an initial version of the policy is automatically generated and then gradually refined by detecting and fixing its shortcomings. The synthesis technique consists of the automated extraction of the vehicle’s exception states and Genetic Programming (GP) for automated composition and optimization of corrective sequences of commands in the form of macro-actions to be applied locally. The focus is specifically on automated synthesis of a policy for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) to efficiently block the advancement of an intruder boat toward a valuable target. This task requires the USV to utilize reactive planning complemented by short-term forward planning to generate specific maneuvers for blocking. The intruder is human-competitive and exhibits a deceptive behavior so that the USV cannot exploit regularity in its attacking behavior. We compared the performance of a hand-coded blocking policy to the performance of a policy that was automatically synthesized. Our results show that the performance of the automatically generated policy exceeds the performance of the hand-coded policy and thus demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-011-9268-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The rationale resides on the political and economic will towards a sustainable environment as well as advances in information and communication technologies that are rapidly being introduced into modern passenger vehicles. From a user perspective, safety and convenience are always a major concern. Further, new vehicles should enable people to drive that presently can not as well as to facilitate the continued mobility of the aging population. Advances are led by endeavors from vehicle manufacturers, the military and academia and development of sensors applicable to ground vehicles. Initially, the motivators are detailed on the reasons that vehicles are being built with intelligent capabilities. An outline of the navigation problem is presented to provide an understanding of the functions needed for a vehicle to navigate autonomously. In order to provide an overall perspective on how technology is converging towards vehicles with autonomous capabilities, advances have been classified into driver centric, network centric and vehicle centric. Vehicle manufacturers are introducing at a rapid pace Advanced Driving Assistance Systems; these are considered as Driver Centric with all functions facilitating driver awareness. This has resulted on the introduction of perception sensors utilizable in traffic situations and technologies that are advancing from simple (targeted to inform drivers) towards the control of the vehicle. The introduction of wireless links onboard vehicles should enable the sharing of information and thus enlarge the situational awareness of drivers as the perceived area is enlarged. Network Centric vehicles provide the means to perceive areas that vehicle onboard sensors alone can not observe and thus grant functions that allow for the deployment of vehicles with autonomous capabilities. Finally, vehicle centric functions are examined; these apply directly to the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Efforts in this realm are not new and thus fundamental work in this area is included. Sensors capable to detect objects in the road network are identified as dictating the pace of developments. The availability of intelligent sensors, advanced digital maps, and wireless communications technologies together with the availability of electric vehicles should allow for deployment on public streets without any environment modification. Likely, there will first be self-driving cars followed by environment modifications to facilitate their deployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-85729-085-4_50,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An increase in capabilities and thus complexity consequently led to a dramatic increase in possible faults that might manifest in errors. Even worse, by applying robots with emerging behavior in non-deterministic real-world environments, faults may be introduced from external sources. Consequently, fault testing has become increasingly difficult. Both, software and hardware may fail or even break, and hence may cause a mission failure, heavy damage, or even severe injuries and loss of life. The ability of a robotic system to function in presence of such faults, so to become fault tolerant, is a continuously growing area of research. Our work meets this challenge by developing a mechanism for robotic systems that is capable of detecting defects, selecting feasible counter measures, and hence keeping robots in a sane and and consequently safe state. Inspired by biology, we conceptually aim at an immune system for a robot (RIS), which is able to detect anomalies, and which is able to autonomously counter them by appropriate means. This position paper outlines the requirements and research scopes that have been identified as relevant for the development of a robotic immune system.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34781-8_12,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the past, a remote sensor was usually a device that collected data to be retrieved at a later time by some other mechanism. This collected data were usually processed well after the fact at a computer greatly removed from the in situ sensing location. This has begun to change as sensor technology, on-board processing, and network communication capabilities have increased and their prices have dropped. There has been an explosion in the number of sensors and sensing devices, not just around the world, but literally throughout the solar system. These sensors are not only becoming vastly more sophisticated, accurate, and detailed in the data they gather but they are also becoming cheaper, lighter, and smaller. At the same time, engineers have developed improved methods to embed computing systems, memory, storage, and communication capabilities into the platforms that host these sensors. Now, it is not unusual to see large networks of sensors working in cooperation with one another. Nor does it seem strange to see the autonomous operation of sensorbased systems, from space-based satellites to smart vacuum cleaners that keep our homes clean and robotic toys that help to entertain and educate our children.

Since its inception, artificial intelligence has been plagued by problems of scaling and brittleness. A fundamental problem impeding the development of artificial intelligence is our dependence on grounding agents by design. That is, currently agents tend to be grounded by their designer’s understanding of the world, task, and robot. However, little (if any) of the knowledge of “how to ground” is embedded in the artificial agent. Consequently, brittle, purpose-built systems result. This paper explores how the intellectual burden of grounding can be shifted from the programmer to the program by designing robots capable of grounding themselves. An overview of a grounding oriented design methodology (Go-Design) is presented - an initial step towards the longer-term objective of developing autonomous grounding capabilities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02921-9_54,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These bounds are typically derived through safety analyses and can be implemented through the use of necessary design features. However, the unpredictability of real world problems can result in changes in the operating context that may invalidate the behavioural bounds themselves, for example, unexpected hazardous operating contexts as a result of failures or degradation. For highly complex problems it may be infeasible to determine the precise desired behavioural bounds of a function that addresses or minimises risk for hazardous operation cases prior to deployment. This paper presents an overview of the safety challenges associated with such a problem and how such problems might be addressed. A self-management framework is proposed that performs on-line risk management. The features of the framework are shown in context of employing intelligent adaptive controllers operating within complex and highly dynamic problem domains such as Gas-Turbine Aero Engine control. Safety assurance arguments enabled by the framework necessary for certification are also outlined.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04468-7_26,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As it is often the case, it is not possible to provide additional capacity, so that a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is necessary. This relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. Also, many actors in a transportation system fit very well the concept of autonomous agents: the driver, the pedestrian, the traffic expert; in some cases, also the intersection and the traffic signal controller can be regarded as an autonomous agent. However, the “agentification” of a transportation system is associated with some challenging issues: the number of agents is high, typically agents are highly adaptive, they react to changes in the environment at individual level but cause an unpredictable collective pattern, and act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, this domain poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as coordination and learning. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to present problems, methods, approaches and practices in traffic engineering (especially regarding traffic signal control); and (ii) to highlight open problems and challenges so that future research in multiagent systems can address them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10458-008-9062-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

And though the need for well-established engineering approaches for building and evaluating such intelligent systems has emerged, currently no widely accepted methodology exists, mainly due to lack of consensus on relevant definitions and scope of applicability. Even existing well-tested evaluation methodologies applied in traditional software engineering, prove inadequate to address the unpredictable emerging factors of the behavior of intelligent components. The following chapter aims to present such a unified and integrated methodology for a specific category of MAS. It takes all constraints and issues into account and denotes the way knowledge extracted with the use of Data mining (DM) techniques can be used for the formulation initially, and the improvement, in the long run, of agent reasoning and MAS performance. The coupling of DM and Agent Technology (AT) principles, proposed within the context of this chapter is therefore expected to provide to the reader an efficient gateway for developing and evaluating highly reconfigurable software approaches that incorporate domain knowledge and provide sophisticated Decision Making capabilities. The main objectives of this chapter could be summarized into the following: a) introduce Agent Technology (AT) as a successful paradigm for building Data Mining (DM)-enriched applications, b) provide a methodology for (re)evaluating the performance of such DM-enriched Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), c) Introduce Agent Academy II, an Agent-Oriented Software Engineering framework for building MAS that incorporate knowledge model extracted by the use of (classical and novel) DM techniques and d) denote the benefits of the proposed approach through a real-world demonstrator. This chapter provides a link between DM and AT and explains how these technologies can efficiently cooperate with each other. The exploitation of useful knowledge extracted by the use of DM may considerably improve agent infrastructures, while also increasing reusability and minimizing customization costs. The synergy between DM and AT is ultimately expected to provide MAS with higher levels of autonomy, adaptability and accuracy and, hence, intelligence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-69935-6_14,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most current data fusion methods employ probabilistic descriptions of observations and processes and use Bayesʼ rule to combine this information. This chapter surveys the main probabilistic modeling and fusion techniques including grid-based models, Kalman filtering, and sequential Monte Carlo techniques. This chapter also briefly reviews a number of nonprobabilistic data fusion methods. Data fusion systems are often complex combinations of sensor devices, processing, and fusion algorithms.

The robot is equipped with ultrasound sensors used for obstacle detection, but, in some cases, small obstacles are out of the range of the sensors and can be dragged by the robot without being detected. Using other variables as, measured velocity, undershoots of that velocity or changes in battery voltage, a fuzzy system is able to determine those situations. The paper also analyzes the knowledge extraction process for the application using expert and induced knowledge (from data collected during navigation tasks) in a cooperative way, dealing with integration and simplification issues. The expert knowledge was used for describing the robot behaviour in order to identify the variables that should be used with the aim of detecting a collision of the vehicle against an undetected obstacle, as well as proposing a suitable recovery action. Data collected in real trials were used for inducing knowledge so as to complete and validate the expert knowledge. Both kind of knowledge were integrated in the final fuzzy-based system. The aim is to build up a knowledge base, which is interpretable and accurate at the same time, and it is used by our fuzzy system in order to solve the motion problems under consideration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-006-9125-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This trend is motivated by the current gap between the available technology and the new application demands. On the one hand, the techniques employed in current industrial robots lack the ability to provide flexibility and autonomy: typically, industrial robots perform pre-programmed sequences of operations in highly constrained environments, and are not able to operate in new environments or to face unexpected situations. On the other hand, there is a clear emerging market for truly autonomous robots.

However, there is currently no system for tactical-level reasoning. Such a system should address tasks such as passing cars, making exits on time, and merging into a traffic stream. Many previous approaches have attempted to hand construct large rule-based systems which capture the interactions between multiple input sensors, dynamic and potentially conflicting subgoals, and changing roadway conditions. However, these systems are extremely difficult to design due to the large number of rules, the manual tuning of parameters within the rules, and the complex interactions between the rules. Our approach to this intermediate-level planning is a system which consists of a collection of autonomous agents, each of which specializes in a particular aspect of tactical driving. Each agent examines a subset of the intelligent vehicle's sensors and independently recommends driving decisions based on their local assessment of the tactical situation. This distributed framework allows different reasoning agents to be implemented using different algorithms. When using a collection of agents to solve a single task, it is vital to carefully consider the interactions between the agents. Since each reasoning object contains several internal parameters, manually finding values for these parameters while accounting for the agents' possible interactions is a tedious and error-prone task. In our system, these parameters, and the system's overall dependence on each agent, is automatically tuned using a novel evolutionary optimization strategy, termed Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). Our system, which employs multiple automatically trained agents, can competently drive a vehicle, both in terms of the user-defined evaluation metric, and as measured by their behavior on several driving situations culled from real-life experience. In this article, we describe a method for multiple agent integration which is applied to the automated highway system domain. However, it also generalizes to many complex robotics tasks where multiple interacting modules must simultaneously be configured without individual module feedback.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008243013521,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
