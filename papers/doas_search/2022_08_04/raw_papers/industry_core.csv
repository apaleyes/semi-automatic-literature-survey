289160157,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Hyper-heuristic is a new methodology for the adaptive hybridization of meta-heuristic algorithms to derive a general algorithm for solving optimization problems. This work focuses on the selection type of hyper-heuristic, called the exponential Monte Carlo with counter (EMCQ). Current implementations rely on the memory-less selection that can be counterproductive as the selected search operator may not (historically) be the best performing operator for the current search instance. Addressing this issue, we propose to integrate the memory into EMCQ for combinatorial t-wise test suite generation using reinforcement learning based on the Q-learning mechanism, called Q-EMCQ. The limited application of combinatorial test generation on industrial programs can impact the use of such techniques as Q-EMCQ. Thus, there is a need to evaluate this kind of approach against relevant industrial software, with a purpose to show the degree of interaction required to cover the code as well as finding faults. We applied Q-EMCQ on 37 real-world industrial programs written in Function Block Diagram (FBD) language, which is used for developing a train control management system at Bombardier Transportation Sweden AB. The results show that Q-EMCQ is an efficient technique for test case generation. Addition- ally, unlike the t-wise test suite generation, which deals with the minimization problem, we have also subjected Q-EMCQ to a maximization problem involving the general module clustering to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show the Q-EMCQ is also capable of outperforming the original EMCQ as well as several recent meta/hyper-heuristic including modified choice function, Tabu high-level hyper-heuristic, teaching learning-based optimization, sine cosine algorithm, and symbiotic optimization search in clustering quality within comparable execution time",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An evaluation of Monte Carlo-based hyper-heuristic for interaction testing of industrial embedded software applications,10.1007/s00500-020-04769-z,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
304693960,2020-01-01T00:00:00,Fault detection and fault diagnosis are crucial subsystems to be integrated within the control architecture of modern industrial processes to ensure high quality standards. In this paper we present a two-stage unsupervised approach for fault detection and diagnosis in household appliances. In particular a suitable testing procedure has been implemented on a real industrial production line in order to extract the most meaningful features that allow to efficiently classify different types of fault by consecutively exploiting deep autoencoder neural network and k-means or hierarchical clustering techniques,,A deep learning unsupervised approach for fault diagnosis of household appliances,,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322738580,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An important research problem in artificial intelligence is how to organize multiple agents, and coordinate them, so that they can work together to solve problems. Coordinating agents in a multi-agent system can significantly affect the systems performance-the agents can, in many instances, be organized so that they can solve tasks more efficiently, and consequently benefit collectively and individually. Central to this endeavor is coalition formation-the process by which heterogeneous agents organize and form disjoint groups (coalitions). Coalition formation often involves finding a coalition structure (an exhaustive set of disjoint coalitions) that maximizes the systems potential performance (e.g., social welfare) through coalition structure generation. However, coalition structure generation typically has no notion of goals. In cooperative settings, where coordination of multiple coalitions is important, this may generate suboptimal teams for achieving and accomplishing the tasks and goals at hand. With this in mind, we consider simultaneously generating coalitions of agents and assigning the coalitions to independent alternatives (e.g., tasks/goals), and present an anytime algorithm for the simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment problem. This combinatorial optimization problem hasmany real-world applications, including forming goal-oriented teams. To evaluate the presented algorithms performance, we present five methods for synthetic problem set generation, and benchmark the algorithm against the industry-grade solver CPLEXusing randomized data sets of varying distribution and complexity. To test its anytime-performance, we compare the quality of its interim solutions against those generated by a greedy algorithm and pure random search. Finally, we also apply the algorithm to solve the problem of assigning agents to regions in a major commercial strategy game, and show that it can be used in game-playing to coordinate smaller sets of agents in real-time.Funding Agencies|Linkoping University; Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An anytime algorithm for optimal simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment,10.1007/s10458-020-09450-1,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395142086,2019-01-29T00:00:00,"[EN] Classification or typology systems used to categorize different human body parts have
existed for many years. Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features.
Ergonomics, forensic anthropology, crime prevention or new human-machine interaction
systems and online activities, like e-commerce, e-learning, games, dating or social networks, are fields in which classifications of facial features are useful, for example, to create
digital interlocutors that optimize the interactions between human and machines. However,
classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported
low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. This
work presents a computer-based procedure to automatically classify facial features based
on their global appearance. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgements from human observers, and facilitates the development of
taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained through this procedure are presented
for eyes, mouths and noses.Fuentes-Hurtado, F.; Diego-Mas, JA.; Naranjo Ornedo, V.; Alcañiz Raya, ML. (2019). Automatic classification of human facial features based on their appearance.

429122164,2020-08-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The paper presents the results of the Battle of Postdisaster Response and Restoration (BPDRR) presented in a special session at the first International water distribution systems analysis & computing and control in the water industry (WDSA/CCWI) Joint Conference, held in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in July 2018. The BPDRR problem focused on how to respond and restore water service after the occurrence of five earthquake scenarios that cause structural damage in a water distribution system. Participants were required to propose a prioritization schedule to fix the damages of each scenario while following restrictions on visibility/nonvisibility of damages. Each team/approach was evaluated against six performance criteria: (1) time without supply for hospital/firefighting, (2) rapidity of recovery, (3) resilience loss, (4) average time of no user service, (5) number of users without service for eight consecutive hours, and (6) water loss. Three main types of approaches were identified from the submissions: (1) general-purpose metaheuristic algorithms, (2) greedy algorithms, and (3) ranking-based prioritizations. All three approaches showed potential to solve the challenge efficiently. The results of the participants showed that for this network, the impact of a large-diameter pipe failure on the network is more significant than several smaller pipes failures. The location of isolation valves and the size of hydraulic segments influenced the resilience of the system during emergencies. On average, the interruptions to water supply (hospitals and firefighting) varied considerably among solutions and emergency scenarios, highlighting the importance of private water storage for emergencies. The effects of damages and repair work were more noticeable during the peak demand periods (morning and noontime) than during the low-flow periods; and tank storage helped to preserve functionality of the network in the first few hours after a simulated event.

480211410,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Credit card fraud jeopardizes the trust of customers in e-commerce transactions. This led in recent years to major advances in the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with short reaction time and high precision. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of the fraud behavior makes it difficult to tailor existing systems to different contexts (e.g. new payment systems, different countries and/or population segments). Given the high cost (research, prototype development, and implementation in production) of designing data-driven FDSs, it is crucial for transactional companies to define procedures able to adapt existing pipelines to new challenges. From an AI/machine learning perspective, this is known as the problem of transfer learning. This paper discusses the design and implementation of transfer learning approaches for e-commerce credit card fraud detection and their assessment in a real setting. The case study, based on a six-month dataset (more than 200 million e-commerce transactions) provided by the industrial partner, relates to the transfer of detection models developed for a European country to another country. In particular, we present and discuss 15 transfer learning techniques (ranging from naive baselines to state-of-the-art and new approaches), making a critical and quantitative comparison in terms of precision for different transfer scenarios. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we show that the accuracy of many transfer methods is strongly dependent on the number of labeled samples in the target domain and (ii) we propose an ensemble solution to this problem based on self-supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation classifiers. The thorough experimental assessment shows that this solution is both highly accurate and hardly sensitive to the number of labeled samples",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Transfer Learning Strategies for Credit Card Fraud Detection,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104472,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A detailed analysis of the various means to increase the percentage of processed data is provided and the experimental implementation of a way to obtain and preprocess data in a mobile device network in real-time mode is shown.During the analysis of the subject, the next fields of research were observed: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data, and GPGPU technology. The increasing numbers of publications, especially of papers that include mobile networks, were emphasized as evidence of rapid growth of the industry and a transition of neuron network algorithms toward mobile operating systems.Further analysis was focused on highlighting the most relevant and perspective objects for the research. The analysis showed that amidst currently most innovative and broadly widespread operation systems and frameworks to implement and engage neuron network algorithms Android operation system and TensorFlow framework has the most significant advantages.Due to the purpose of developing an experimental solution based on mobile device network and neuron network, different classes and types of neuron network architectures were explored. Two major types of mobile neuron networks such as quantized and integer neuron networks and the principal dissimilarity between them were described. Various neuron networks were tested on mobile devices with Internet connection via specially developed auxiliary software using GPGPU technology. Experimental results had shown that modern smartphones such as Huawei P20-Pro are capable to analyze, store and transmit the incoming from its camera sensor information at a rate of up to 40 frames per second. The usage of mobile GPU for improving the performance of the neuron networks was proved to be effective as such the number of frames processed by a neuron network per second can be elevated up to 10 times.The experimental software that task was to search for the given by user object in a real-time mode using mobile device network as both — server and processing nodes — proved to be a violable solution for the increasing amount of preprocessed up-to-the-minute information in the Big Data industry after the diligent research.As a summary, it needs to be stated that current progress in mobile device industry is making possible to bring neuron network technologies on mobile platforms and expand the capability of data aggregating services through the use of modern Deep Learning frameworks and GPGPU technology.Проаналізовано напрямки досліджень у галузі концептів Big Data, розподілених мереж мобільних пристроїв і Deep Learning.

390009408,2020-02-20T00:00:00,"Methods of machine intelligence with training contribute their specifics to the creation and commissioning of a gaming system.One of the main problems is the need to anticipate the entire set of input situations and possible answers at the time of design and the impossibility of expanding their list withoutretraining. This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.Методы машинного интеллекта с обучением вносят свою специфику к созданию и наладке игровой системы.Одна из главных проблем — это необходимость предвидения всего набора входных ситуаций и возможных ответов на моменте проектирования и невозможность расширения их списка без переобучения.

287429785,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of wireless sensor networks, which are the key ingredient in the growing Internet of Things (IoT), has surged over the past few years with a widening range of applications in the industry, healthcare, agriculture, with a special attention to monitoring and tracking, often tied with security issues. In some applications, sensors can be deployed in remote, large unpopulated areas, whereas in others, they serve to monitor confined busy spaces. In either case, clustering the sensor network’s nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network’s lifetime. In the present paper, we survey and compare popular and advanced clustering schemes and provide a detailed analysis of their performance as a function of scale, type of collected data or their heterogeneity, and noise level.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",HAL CCSD,Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents an intelligent system capable of deciding which countermeasures to take in order to mitigate an intrusion in a software defined network. The interaction between the intruder and the defender is posed as a Markov game and MuZero algorithm is used to train the model through self-play. Once trained, the model is integrated with an SDN controller, so that it is able to apply the countermeasures of the game in a real network. To measure the performance of the model, attackers and defenders with different training steps have been confronted and the scores obtained by each of them, the duration of the games and the ratio of games won have been collected. The results show that the defender is capable of deciding which measures minimize the impact of the intrusion, isolating the attacker and preventing it from compromising key machines in the network.This work was supported in part by the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) through the Project EGIDA-RED DE EXCELENCIA EN TECNOLOGIAS DE SEGURIDAD Y PRIVACIDAD under Grant CER20191012, in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under Grant PID2019-104966GB-I00, in part by the Basque Business Development Agency (SPRI)-Basque Country Government ELKARTEK Program through the projects TRUSTIND under Grant KK-2020/00054 and 3KIA under Grant KK-2020/00049, and in part by the Basque Country Program of Grants for Research Groups under Grant IT-1244-19",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Towards Autonomous Defense of SDN Networks Using MuZero Based Intelligent Agents,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100706,https://core.ac.uk/download/479999354.pdf,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To enable novice operators to access such knowledge, it is important to reinvent the way of interacting with digitally enhanced smart devices. In this research, a mobile augmented reality remote monitoring system is proposed to help operators with low knowledge and experience level comprehend digital twin data of a device and interact with the device. It analyses both historic logs as well as real-time data through a cloud server and enriches 2D data with 3D models and animations in the 3D physical space. A cloud-based machine learning algorithm is applied to transform learned knowledge into live presentations on a mobile device for users to interact with. A scaled-down case study is conducted using a tower crane model to demonstrate the potential benefits as well as implications when the system is deployed in industrial environments. This user study verifies that the proposed solution yields consistent measurable improvements for novice users in human-device interaction that is statistically significant",'MDPI AG',An Integrated Mobile Augmented Reality Digital Twin Monitoring System,10.3390/computers10080099,,"[{'title': 'Computers', 'identifiers': ['issn:2073-431X', '2073-431x']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The cutting tool is a critical asset of the milling machine; the failure of the cutting tool causes a loss in industrial productivity due to unplanned downtime. In such cases, a proper predictive maintenance strategy by real-time health monitoring of cutting tools becomes essential. Accurately predicting the useful life of equipment plays a vital role in the predictive maintenance arena of industry 4.0. Many active research efforts have been done to estimate tool life in varied directions. However, the consolidated study of the implemented techniques and future pathways is still missing. So, the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic and comprehensive literature survey on the data-driven approach of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation of cutting tools during the milling process. The authors have summarized different monitoring techniques, feature extraction methods, decision-making models, and available sensors currently used in the data-driven model. The authors have also presented publicly available datasets related to milling under various operating conditions to compare the accuracy of the prediction model for tool wear estimation. Finally, the article concluded with the challenges, limitations, recent advancements in RUL prognostics techniques using Artificial Intelligence (AI), and future research scope to explore more in this area",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',"Data-Driven Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Milling Process: Sensors, Algorithms, Datasets, and Future Directions",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101284,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
481224283,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"In the travel insurance industry, cancel-for-any-reason insurance, also known as a cancellation protection service (CPS), is a recent attempt to strike a balance between customer satisfaction and service provider (SP) profits. However, some exceptional circumstances, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a dramatic decrease in SP revenues, especially for non-refundable tickets purchased early with CPS. This paper begins by presenting a risk group segmentation of customers in an online ticket reservation system. Then, a CPS fee is recommended depending on the different customer risk groups provided by the cluster segmentation via different clustering algorithms such as centroid-based K-means, hierarchical agglomerative, DBSCAN, and artificial neural network-based SOM algorithms. According to the implemented cluster metrics, which include the Silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index, Entropy index, and DBCV index, the SOM algorithm presents the most appropriate result. After predicting the new customer cluster, a CPS fee will be calculated with the proposed adaptive CPS method based on the cluster segmentation weights. Determining the weight of each cluster is related to the total CPS revenue threshold for all clusters defined by the SP. Therefore, to avoid a loss for SPs, the total CPS revenue will be kept constant with the threshold that the SP has been adjusted. The experimental results based on real-world data show that the risk group segmentation of customers helps to maintain a balance between CPS fees and SP profits. Finally, according to the calculated weights, the proposed model pegs the SP gain/loss variation with a 0.00012 exchange ratio",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Cancel-for-Any-Reason Insurance Recommendation Using Customer Transaction-Based Clustering,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064929,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks. We demonstrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of Citrus: a novel intrusion detection framework which is adept at tackling emerging threats through the collection and labelling of live attack data by utilising diverse Internet vantage points in order to detect and classify malicious behaviour using graph-based metrics as well as a range of machine learning (ML) algorithms.

Industry 4.0 is a suite of enabler technologies for such smart ecosystems that allow transformation of industrial processes. When implemented, Industry 4.0 technologies have a huge impact on efficiency, productivity and profitability of businesses. The adoption and implementation of Industry 4.0, however, require to overcome a number of practical challenges, in most cases, due to the lack of modernisation and automation in place with traditional manufacturers. This paper presents a first of its kind case study for moving a traditional food manufacturer, still using the machinery more than one hundred years old, a common occurrence for small- and medium-sized businesses, to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies. The paper reports the challenges we have encountered during the transformation process and in the development stage. The paper also presents a smart production control system that we have developed by utilising AI, machine learning, Internet of things, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems and cloud computing technologies. The system provides novel data collection, information extraction and intelligent monitoring services, enabling improved efficiency and consistency as well as reduced operational cost. The platform has been developed in real-world settings offered by an Innovate UK-funded project and has been integrated into the company’s existing production facilities.

288551532,2019,"In proposing a machine learning approach for a flow shop scheduling problem with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking, this paper seeks to generate a tree-based priority rule in terms of a well-performing decision tree (DT) for dispatching jobs. Furthermore, generating a generic DT and RF that yields competitive results for instance scenarios that structurally differ from the training instances was another goal of our research. The proposed DT relies on high quality solutions, obtained using a constraint programming (CP) formulation. Novel aspects include a unified representation of job sequencing and machine assignment decisions, as well as the generation of random forests (RF) to counteract overfitting behaviour. To show the performance of the proposed approaches, different instance scenarios for two objectives (makespan and total tardiness minimisation) were implemented, based on randomised problem data. The background of this approach is a real-world physical system of an industrial partner that represents a typical shop floor for many production processes, such as furniture and window construction. The results of a comparison of the DT and RF approach with two priority dispatching rules, the original CP solutions and tight lower bounds retrieved from a strengthened mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation show that the proposed machine learning approach performs well in most instance sets for the makespan objective and in all sets for the total tardiness objective.© The Author(s) 201",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"A machine learning approach for flow shop scheduling problems with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking",10.1007/s00291-019-00567-8,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': [' 0171-6468', 'ISSN: 0171-6468']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional manual disease-monitoring methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and ineffective. Therefore, an efficient method is urgently needed for real-time dynamic monitoring of orchard grape diseases. The classical deep learning network can achieve high accuracy in recognizing grape leaf diseases; however, the large amount of model parameters requires huge computing resources, and it is difficult to deploy to actual application scenarios. To solve the above problems, a cross-channel interactive attention mechanism-based lightweight model (ECA-SNet) is proposed. First, based on 6,867 collected images of five common leaf diseases of measles, black rot, downy mildew, leaf blight, powdery mildew, and healthy leaves, image augmentation techniques are used to construct the training, validation, and test set. Then, with ShuffleNet-v2 as the backbone, an efficient channel attention strategy is introduced to strengthen the ability of the model for extracting fine-grained lesion features. Ultimately, the efficient lightweight model ECA-SNet is obtained by further simplifying the network layer structure. The model parameters amount of ECA-SNet 0.5× is only 24.6% of ShuffleNet-v2 1.0×, but the recognition accuracy is increased by 3.66 percentage points to 98.86%, and FLOPs are only 37.4 M, which means the performance is significantly better than other commonly used lightweight methods. Although the similarity of fine-grained features of different diseases image is relatively high, the average F1-score of the proposed lightweight model can still reach 0.988, which means the model has strong stability and anti-interference ability. The results show that the lightweight attention mechanism model proposed in this paper can efficiently use image fine-grained information to diagnose orchard grape leaf diseases at a low computing cost",'Frontiers Media SA',Fine-Grained Grape Leaf Diseases Recognition Method Based on Improved Lightweight Attention Network,10.3389/fpls.2021.738042,https://core.ac.uk/download/490887727.pdf,"[{'title': 'Frontiers in Plant Science', 'identifiers': ['1664-462x', 'issn:1664-462X']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

295509361,2019-06,"In this study, we use unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with multispectral cameras to search for bodies in maritime rescue operations. A series of flights were performed in open‐water scenarios in the northwest of Spain, using a certified aquatic rescue dummy in dangerous areas and real people when the weather conditions allowed it. The multispectral images were aligned and used to train a convolutional neural network for body detection. An exhaustive evaluation was performed to assess the best combination of spectral channels for this task. Three approaches based on a MobileNet topology were evaluated, using (a) the full image, (b) a sliding window, and (c) a precise localization method. The first method classifies an input image as containing a body or not, the second uses a sliding window to yield a class for each subimage, and the third uses transposed convolutions returning a binary output in which the body pixels are marked. In all cases, the MobileNet architecture was modified by adding custom layers and preprocessing the input to align the multispectral camera channels. Evaluation shows that the proposed methods yield reliable results, obtaining the best classification performance when combining green, red‐edge, and near‐infrared channels. We conclude that the precise localization approach is the most suitable method, obtaining a similar accuracy as the sliding window but achieving a spatial localization close to 1 m.

490881795,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"Real-time business practices require huge amounts of data directly from the production assets. This new thirst for accurate and timely data has forced the convergence of the traditionally business-focused information technology (IT) environment with the production-focused operational technology (OT). Recently, software-defined network (SDN) methodologies have benefitted OT networks with enhanced situational awareness, centralized configuration, deny-by-default forwarding rules, and increased performance. What makes SDNs so innovative is the separation between the control plane and the data plane, centralizing the command in the controllers. However, due to their young age, the use of SDNs in the industry context has not yet matured comprehensive SDN-based architectures for IT/OT networks, which are also resistant to security attacks such as denial-of-service ones, which may occur in SDN-based industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. One main motivation is that the lack of comprehensive SDN-based architectures for IT/OT networks making it difficult to effectively simulate, analyze, and identify proper detection and mitigation strategies for DoS attacks in IT/OT networks. No consolidated security solutions are available that provide DoS detection and mitigation strategies in IT/OT networks. Along this direction, this paper’s contributions are twofold. On the one hand, this paper proposes a convergent IT/OT SDN-based architecture applied in a real implementation of an IT/OT support infrastructure called SIRDAM4.0 within the context of the SBDIOI40 project. On the other hand, this paper proposes a qualitative analysis on how this architecture works under DoS attacks, focusing on what the specific problems and vulnerabilities are. In particular, we simulated several distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack scenarios within the context of the proposed architecture to show the minimum effort needed by the attacker to hack the network, and our obtained experimental results show how it is possible to compromise the network, thus considerably worsening the performance and, in general, the functioning of the network.

373377799,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Object detection is arguably one of the most important and complex tasks to enable the advent of next-generation autonomous systems. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques allowed a significant improvement in detection accuracy and latency of modern neural networks, allowing their adoption in automotive, avionics and industrial embedded systems, where performances are required to meet size, weight and power constraints.Multiple benchmarks and surveys exist to compare state-of-the-art detection networks, profiling important metrics, like precision, latency and power efficiency on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) embedded platforms. However, we observed a fundamental lack of fairness in the existing comparisons, with a number of implicit assumptions that may significantly bias the metrics of interest. This includes using heterogeneous settings for the input size, training dataset, threshold confidences, and, most importantly, platform-specific optimizations, that are especially important when assessing latency and energy-related values. The lack of uniform comparisons is mainly due to the significant effort required to re-implement network models, whenever openly available, on the specific platforms, to properly configure the available acceleration engines for optimizing performance, and to re-train the model using a homogeneous dataset.This paper aims at filling this gap, providing a comprehensive and fair comparison of the best-in-class Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time embedded systems, detailing the effort made to achieve an unbiased characterization on cutting-edge system-on-chips.

However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training.

Detection techniques for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have gained a lot of attention in both academia and industry. Detection techniques have a significant impact on the massive MIMO receivers’ performance and complexity. Although a plethora of research is conducted using the classical detection theory and techniques, the performance is deteriorated when the ratio between the numbers of antennas and users is relatively small. In addition, most of classical detection techniques are suffering from severe performance loss and/or high computational complexity in real channel scenarios. Therefore, there is a significant room for fundamental research contributions in data detection based on the deep learning (DL) approach. DL architectures can be exploited to provide optimal performance with similar complexity of conventional detection techniques. This paper aims to provide insights on DL based detectors to a generalist of wireless communications. We garner the DL based massive MIMO detectors and classify them so that a reader can find the differences between various architectures with a wider range of potential solutions and variations. In this paper, we discuss the performance-complexity profile, pros and cons, and implementation stiffness of each DL based detector’s architecture. Detection in cell-free massive MIMO is also presented. Challenges and our perspectives for future research directions are also discussed.

Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria.

The use of local energy generation, especially from renewable sources, and the possibility of having multiple energy providers allow the user to manage its consumption according to energy prices and energy availability. The proposed solution takes into account the energy availability of renewable sources and energy prices to optimize the scheduling of a production line using a genetic algorithm with multiple constraints.

Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed.

In addition, sorghum cultivation is economically profitable and it does not contain the proteins that affect celiac patients. In the last years, a variety of ""free gluten"" food products were developed for improving the celiac diet, as well as sorghum beers, which are frequently produced in a home-made manner on a very small scale by individual brewers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a non-alcoholic beverage from sorghum. In this work, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a batch plant for producing malt drink from sorghum at industrial level is proposed. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, which is implemented and solved in GAMS using the CPLEX solver. Through experimental results, design and operation model parameters are obtained in order to develop real-fit formulation. The investment cost is minimized, and a technical-social-economical analysis is presented in order to evaluate the more profitable and sustainable option to produce malt drink from sorghum. For a production of 5,000 L/d, the payback period is equal to 4.8 years and the unit cost per bottle of 300 mL is $ 0.312. The obtained malt drink with technology presented in this work, meets the physical and organoleptics requirements established for its consumption according with the comparison reported by Nieblas, with two malt drinks from barley commercialized in Cuba, Bucanero and Tínima malt drink.Fil: Albernas Carvajal, Yailet.

This knowledge was used to develop a rapid and simple five-step assay to quantify Campylobacter, which was subsequently assessed for its specificity, reproducibility and accuracy in quantifying Campylobacter levels from processed chickens. The assay was found to be highly specific for C. jejuni and C. coli and was capable of distinguishing between samples that are either within or exceeding the industry set target of 6000 Campylobacter colony forming units (CFU) per carcass (equivalent to 12\ua0CFU per ml of chicken rinse) with >90% accuracy relative to culture-based methods.Our method can reliably quantify Campylobacter counts of processed chickens with an accuracy comparable to culture-based assays but provides results within hours as opposed to days.The research presented here will help improve food safety by providing fast Campylobacter detection that will enable the implementation of real-time risk management strategies in poultry processing plants to rapidly test processed chickens and identify effective intervention strategies.

Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions. One reason may be fragility in treating properly unexpected or perturbed data. The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations. A systematic approach is proposed for artificially injecting perturbations in the data and for evaluating the robustness of the models. This approach focuses on two perturbations that are likely to happen during data collection. Our experimental study, conducted on twenty sensors’ datasets from the public University of California Riverside (UCR) repository, shows a great disparity of the models’ robustness under data quality degradation. Those results are used to analyse whether the impact of such robustness can be predictable—thanks to decision trees—which would prevent us from testing all perturbations scenarios.

This paper focuses on addressing this problem from a manufacturer’s perspective, conducting a case study in a retail packaged foods manufacturing company located in Latin America. We developed two machine learning based systems to detect OOS events automatically. The first is based on a single Random Forest classifier with balanced data, and the second is an ensemble of six different classification algorithms. We used transactional data from the manufacturer information system and physical audits. The novelty of this work is our use of new predictor variables of OOS events. The system was successfully implemented and tested in a retail packaged foods manufacturer company. By incorporating the new predictive variables in our Random Forest and Ensemble classifier, we were able to improve their system’s predictive power. In particular, the Random Forest classifier presented the best performance in a real-world setting, achieving a detection precision of 72% and identifying 68% of the total OOS events.

Variety of services and applications can be built based on the availability and accessibility of indoor positioning information, for example indoor navigation and various location-based services. Different approaches have been proposed to provide indoor positioning information to users, in which an underlying system infrastructure is usually assumed to be well deployed in advance to provide the position information to users. Among many others, one common strategy is to deploy a bunch of active sensor nodes, such as WiFi APs and Bluetooth transceivers, to the indoor environment to serve as reference landmarks. The user's current location can thus be obtained directly or indirectly according to the active sensor signals collected by the user. Different from conventional infrastructure-based approaches, which put additional sensor devices to the environment, we utilize available objects in the environment as location landmarks. Leveraging wildly available smartphone devices as customer premises equipment to the user and the cutting-edge deep-learning technology, we investigate the feasibility of an infrastructure-free intelligent indoor positioning system based on visual information only. The proposed scheme has been verified by a real case study, which is to provide indoor positioning information to users in Taipei Main Station, one of the busiest transportation stations in the world. We use available pedestrian directional signage as location landmarks, which include all of the 52 pedestrian directional signs in the testing area. The Google Objection Detection framework is applied for detection and recognition of the pedestrian directional sign.

Although such enhancements open the door to a significant performance improvement, they also pose many challenges to LA optimization. In this article, we first present the signaling aspects of NR technology for multi-domain LA and the challenges that need to be faced. Then, we explore the latest advances on LA for wireless networks. We envision a combination of machine learning (ML) tools with multi-domain LA as a key enabler for 5G and beyond networks. Finally, we investigate emerging ML approaches for LA and present a promising application of ML for LA that is assessed with simulations. With this scheme, the training is performed at the network side to relieve the user equipment (UE) to do such a complex task. It is shown with simulations that our ML approach outperforms the well-known outer loop link adaptation (OLLA) algorithm in terms of instantaneous block error rate (BLER), while reaching the same average spectral efficiency (SE). Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed scheme only requires 4 bits to represent the features used to train the model, which makes it suitable for implementation in real systems with limited feedback",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Emerging Tools for Link Adaptation on 5G NR and Beyond: Challenges and Opportunities,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111783,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395677188,2020-07-17T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is still restricted to simulation or to enhance human-operated systems through recommendations. Real-world environments (e.g. industrial robots or power grids) are generally designed with safety constraints in mind implemented in the shape of valid actions masks or contingency controllers. For example, the range of motion and the angles of the motors of a robot can be limited to physical boundaries. Violating constraints thus results in rejected actions or entering in a safe mode driven by an external controller, making RL agents incapable of learning from their mistakes. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of a state-of-the-art deep RL algorithm (DQN), enabling learning from forbidden actions. To do so, the standard Q-learning update is enhanced with an extra safety loss inspired by structured classification. We empirically show that it reduces the number of hit constraints during the learning phase and accelerates convergence to near-optimal policies compared to using standard DQN.

One of the most problematic areas is increasing the efficiency of the construction industry through the introduction of digital technologies. The research carried out is based on the application of an approach that is implemented using artificial intelligence. The study used machine learning and fuzzy logic methods to mark visual data and analyze it for potential threats, as well as to reduce all possible risks. The main feature of this approach is that using machine learning technology, it is possible to reduce the risks of a project before they affect its profit. So, using artificial intelligence in combination with BIM technologies, it is possible to predict work on construction projects based on real-time data, past activities and other factors in such a way as to optimize construction processes. The benefits to be gained from implementing digital processes will become even more evident in future projects as AI continues to analyze company data. This is due to the fact that the proposed approach using fuzzy logic has a number of features, in particular, the more information machine learning algorithms process, the more complex they become. As a result, they provide even more useful information and allow to make even better decisions. This provides an opportunity to minimize risks and efficiently allocate resources when working on projects. Compared to conventional information technology, artificial intelligence can be used to build a knowledge-based security management system and combine statistical probabilities to help mitigate security risks in construction projects.Объектом исследования является процесс использования информационных технологий в строительной отрасли.

In this study, a methodological approach is presented to spatially assess the trophic state of large territories based on public water quality databases. The trophic state index (TSI) includes total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll A, chemical oxygen demand, and Secchi disk depth values as water quality indicators. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatiotemporal attributes of the water quality data, in addition to spatially displaying the results of TSI calculations. As a case study, this methodological approach was applied to determine the critical regions for mitigating eutrophication in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Although a decreasing trend was observed for the TSI values over time for most subbasins (2012–2019), a tendency for extreme hypereutrophication was observed in some regions, such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area and the Altos region, which are of high economic relevance at the state level. A correlation analysis was performed between the TSI parameters and rainfall measurements for all subbasins under analysis, which suggested a tendency for nutrient wash-off during the rainy seasons for most subbasins; however, further research is needed to quantify the real impacts of rainfall by including other variables such as elevation and slope. The relationships between the water quality indicators and land cover were also explored. The GIS methodology proposed in this study can be used to spatially assess the trophic state of large regions over time, taking advantage of available water quality databases. This will enable the efficient development and implementation of public policies to assess and mitigate the eutrophication of water sources, as well as the efficient allocation of resources for critical regions.

This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of big data, problems of data collection, its reliability and use. Big data can be used for the analysis and modeling of phenomena relevant to public governance and social policy. Big data consist of three main types: a) historical data, b) present data with little delay, c) prognostic data for future forecasting. The following categories of big data can be defined as: a) data from social networks, b) traditional data from business systems, c) machine-generated data, such as water extraction, pollution, satellite information. The article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of big data. There are big data challenges such as data security, lack of cooperation in civil service and social work, in rare situations – data fragmentation, incompleteness and erroneous issues, as well as ethical issues regarding the analysis of data and its use in social policy and social administration.
Big data, covered by Artificial Intelligence, can be used in public governance and social policy by identifying “the hot spots” of various phenomena, by prognosing the meanings of variables in the future on the basis of past time rows, and by calculating the optimal motion of actions in the situations where there are possible various alternatives. The technologies of Artificial Intelligence are used more profoundly in many spheres of public policy, and in the governance of COVID-19 pandemics too.
The substantial advantages of the provided big data and Artificial Intelligence are a holistic improvement of public services, possibilities of personalization, the enhancement of citizen satisfaction, the diminishing of the costs of processing expenditure, the targeting of adopted and implemented decisions, more active involvement of citizens, the feedback of the preferences of policy formation and implementation, the observation of social phenomenas in real time, and possibilities for more detailed prognosing.
Challenges to security of data, necessary resources and competences, the lack of cooperation in public service, especially rare instances of data fragmentation, roughness, falseness, and ethical questions regarding data analysis and application can be evaluated as the most significant problems of using big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.
Big data and their analytics conducted using Artificial Intelligence technologies can contribute to the adequacy and objectivity of decisions in public governance and social policy, effectively curbing corruption and nepotism by raising the authority and confidence of public sector organizations in governance, which is so lacking in the modern world.Šiame tarpdisciplininiame straipsnyje pateikiama XXI amžiaus ketvirtosios pramonės revoliucijos fenomenų – didžiųjų duomenų ir dirbtinio intelekto technologijų – samprata ir aptariamos jų naudojimo viešojo valdymo srityje ir socialinėje politikoje galimybės, nagrinėjami didžiųjų duomenų pranašumai ir trūkumai, jų rinkimo, patikimumo ir naudojimo problemos.

The use of local energy generation, especially from renewable sources, and the possibility of having multiple energy providers allow the user to manage its consumption according to energy prices and energy availability. The proposed solution takes into account the energy availability of renewable sources and energy prices to optimize the scheduling of a production line using a genetic algorithm with multiple constraints.

In this paper, the contribution of gesture recognition and pose estimation to the smooth introduction of cobots into an industrial assembly line is described, with a view to performing actions in parallel with the human operators and enabling interaction between them. The proposed active vision system uses two RGB-D cameras that record different points of view of gestures and poses of the operator, to build an external perception layer for the robot that facilitates spatiotemporal adaptation, in accordance with the human's behavior. The use-case of this work is concerned with LCD TV assembly of an appliance manufacturer, comprising of two parts. The first part of the above-mentioned operation is assigned to a robot, strengthening the assembly line. The second part is assigned to a human operator. Gesture recognition, pose estimation, physical interaction, and sonic notification, create a multimodal human-robot interaction system. Five experiments are performed, to test if gesture recognition and pose estimation can reduce the cycle time and range of motion of the operator, respectively. Physical interaction is achieved using the force sensor of the cobot. Pose estimation through a skeleton-tracking algorithm provides the cobot with human pose information and makes it spatially adjustable. Sonic notification is added for the case of unexpected incidents. A real-time gesture recognition module is implemented through a Deep Learning architecture consisting of Convolutional layers, trained in an egocentric view and reducing the cycle time of the routine by almost 20%. This constitutes an added value in this work, as it affords the potential of recognizing gestures independently of the anthropometric characteristics and the background.

Particularly, the designed computer vision system and the image-based criteria defined to determine when a product has to be accepted or rejected are presented. In addition, the vision control software is described with special emphasis on the different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that have been considered (ResNet18, ResNet50, Vgg19 and DenseNet161, non-pre-trained and pre-trained on ImageNet) and on the specifically designed dataset.

With the advancement of machine learning methods in resource-constrained environments, smart sensor systems have become increasingly powerful. As more data-driven approaches are deployed on the sensors, it is of growing importance to monitor data quality at all times of system operation. We introduce a smart capacitive sensor system with an embedded data quality monitoring algorithm to enhance the safety of human–robot interaction scenarios. The smart capacitive skin sensor is capable of detecting the distance and angle of objects nearby by utilizing consumer-grade sensor electronics. To further acknowledge the safety aspect of the sensor, a dedicated layer to monitor data quality in real-time is added to the embedded software of the sensor. Two learning algorithms are used to implement the sensor functionality: (1) a fully connected neural network to infer the position and angle of objects nearby and (2) a one-class SVM to account for the data quality assessment based on out-of-distribution detection. We show that the sensor performs well under normal operating conditions within a range of 200 mm and also detects abnormal operating conditions in terms of poor data quality successfully. A mean absolute distance error of 11.6mm was achieved without data quality indication. The overall performance of the sensor system could be further improved to 7.5mm by monitoring the data quality, adding an additional layer of safety for human–robot interaction",'MDPI AG',A Smart Capacitive Sensor Skin with Embedded Data Quality Indication for Enhanced Safety in Human–Robot Interaction,10.3390/s21217210,,"[{'title': 'Sensors', 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

IR4.0 shrinks the gap between the digital, more technical world and the physical world. The higher education institutes are now being forced to move into a more digital form of education because if they are not, they are found institutes that are too stubborn to move on from the traditional method of education. The more modern technologies such as data analysis, artificial intelligence and other technologies such as cloud computing need to be concentrated on while going through digital transformation. This paper includes an outlook on digitization, benefits of digital transformation, challenges of implementation, how to have a smooth transition to a more digital environment and the different mechanisms that are in place, that could be improved. Because of the fact that as the generations pass, more and more of the students are getting tech savvy, so, if there is any time to implement digital transformation, it is now.

370074721,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

482691058,2021-11-11T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a relatively new concept that involves the merging of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT). It has emerged from the realization that Internet of Things networks could be further enhanced if they were also provided with Artificial Intelligence, enhancing the extraction of data and network operation. Prior to AIoT, the Internet of Things would consist of networks of sensors embedded in a physical environment, that collected data and sent them to a remote server. Upon reaching the server, a data analysis would be carried out which normally involved the application of a series of Artificial Intelligence techniques by experts. However, as Internet of Things networks expand in smart cities, this workflow makes optimal operation unfeasible. This is because the data that is captured by IoT is increasing in size continually. Sending such amounts of data to a remote server becomes costly, time-consuming and resource inefficient. Moreover, dependence on a central server means that a server failure, which would be imminent if overloaded with data, would lead to a halt in the operation of the smart service for which the IoT network had been deployed. Thus, decentralizing the operation becomes a crucial element of AIoT. This is done through the Edge Computing paradigm which takes the processing of data to the edge of the network. Artificial Intelligence is found at the edge of the network so that the data may be processed, filtered and analyzed there.  It is even possible to equip the edge of the network with the ability to make decisions through the implementation of AI techniques such as Machine Learning. The speed of decision making at the edge of the network means that many social, environmental, industrial and administrative processes may be optimized, as crucial decisions may be taken faster. 

Deep Intelligence is a tool that employs disruptive Artificial Intelligence techniques for data analysis i.e., classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to extract data from virtually any source type. This is a very important feature given the heterogeneity of the data being produced in the world today. Another very important characteristic is its intuitiveness and ability to operate almost autonomously.  The user is guided through the process which means that anyone can use it without any knowledge of the technical, technological and mathematical aspects of the processes performed by the platform. This means that the Deepint.net platform integrates functionalities that would normally take years to implement in any sector individually and that would normally require a group of experts in data analysis and related technologies [1-322]. 

The Deep Intelligence platform can be used to easily operate Edge Computing architectures and IoT networks. The joint characteristics of a well-designed Edge Computing platform (that is, one which brings computing resources to the edge of the network) and of the advanced Deepint.net platform deployed in a cloud environment, mean that high speed, real-time response, effective troubleshooting and management, as well as precise forecasting can be achieved. 

Moreover, the low cost of the solution, in combination with the availability of low-cost sensors, devices, Edge Computing hardware, means that deployment becomes a possibility for developing countries, where such solutions are needed most",,AIoT for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,,https://core.ac.uk/download/482691058.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions.

Legislation intended to improve access to personal data across national borders has proven to be a double-edged sword, where complexity and implications from misinterpretations have paradoxically resulted in data becoming more siloed. As a result, the potential for development of health specific AI and clinical decision support tools built on real-world data have yet to be fully realized. In this perspective, we propose federated networks as a solution to enable access to diverse data sets and tackle known and emerging health problems. The perspective draws on experience from the World Economic Forum Breaking Barriers to Health Data project, the Personal Health Train and Vantage6 infrastructures, and industry insights. We first define the concept of federated networks in a healthcare context, present the value they can bring to multiple stakeholders, and discuss their establishment, operation and implementation.

Most of the work done for predicting such readmissions using machine learning (ML) have been based on EHR, claims or authorization data from specific sources, which are mostly snapshot data at one static point in time and hence delayed. ADT being dynamic as the data is available instantaneous on occurrence of a medical event/visit adds value. Our goal is to utilize machine learning on unlabeled ADT data to identify patients who are at a high risk of being readmitted. We approached the problem in three parts. First, we labeled patient events using logical rules and finalized one of many readmission definitions that was more encapsulating of varied scenarios. Second, feature engineering was done which encapsulates the longitudinal timeline of each patient in a representative way considering all the contextual information. Third, we developed an automated machine learning pipeline which takes modeling inputs from the user, runs various models to generate readmission prediction, does a cross validation and returns the best model. We tried multiple combinations of models and cross-validation strategies and decided on a random forest model with specific hyper-parameter values and to be the most effective method to classify high risk patients. It had a test AUC-ROC of 72% which is better than quite a few industry standards.

301241016,2016-06-01T00:00:00,"Purpose: The goal of this paper is to develop a pragmatic system of a production throughput

forecasting system for an automated test operation in a hard drive manufacturing plant. The

accurate forecasting result is necessary for the management team to response to any changes in

the production processes and the resources allocations.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we design a production throughput forecasting

system in an automated test operation in hard drive manufacturing plant. The proposed system

consists of three main stages. In the first stage, a mutual information method was adopted for

selecting the relevant inputs into the forecasting model. In the second stage, a generalized

regression neural network (GRNN) was implemented in the forecasting model development

phase. Finally, forecasting accuracy was improved by searching the optimal smoothing parameter

which selected from comparisons result among three optimization algorithms: particle swarm

optimization (PSO), unrestricted search optimization (USO) and interval halving optimization

(IHO).

Findings: The experimental result shows that (1) the developed production throughput

forecasting system using GRNN is able to provide forecasted results close to actual values, and to

projected the future trends of production throughput in an automated hard disk drive test  operation; (2) IHO algorithm performed as appropriate optimization method better than the

other two algorithms. (3) Compared with current forecasting system in manufacturing, the results

show that the proposed system’s performance is superior to the current system in prediction

accuracy and suitable for real-world application.

Originality/value: The production throughput volume is a key performance index of hard disk

drive manufacturing systems that need to be forecast. The production throughput forecasting

result is useful information for management team to respond to any changes in production

processes and resources allocation. However, a practical forecasting system for production

throughput has not been described in detail yet. The experiments were conducted on a real data

set from the final testing operation of hard disk drive manufacturing factory by using Visual Basic

Consuming energy without taking volatile prices into consideration can not only become expensive, but may also increase the peak load, which requires energy providers to generate additional energy using less environment-friendly methods.

We investigate if existing AI planning techniques have the potential to improve upon the current solutions.

352137583,2013-09-15T00:00:00,"A recent trend in intelligent machines and manufacturing has been toward reconfigurable manufacturing systems, which move away from the idea of a fixed factory line executing an unchanging set of operations, and toward the goal of an adaptable factory structure. The logical next challenge in this area is that of on-line reconfigurability. With this capability, machines can reconfigure while running, enable or disable capabilities in real time, and respond quickly to changes in the system or the environment (including faults). We propose an approach to achieving on-line reconfigurability based on a high level of system modularity supported by integrated, model-based planning and control software. Our software capitalizes on many advanced techniques from the artificial intelligence research community, particularly in model-based domain-independent planning and scheduling, heuristic search, and temporal resource reasoning.

147103496,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Energy Storage Systems will play crucial role in controlling the grid of the future when increased penetration of renewable energy sources will take place. Especially batteries are expected to occupy a considerable share of the total energy storage market by simultaneously providing services to different stakeholders such as energy producers, transmission/distribution operators, residential, commercial and industrial consumers. Nowadays, Peak shaving and Time-of-Use applications are the most common services that standalone battery storage systems can provide to industrial consumers (without integrated PV systems and/or wind turbines). A big part of the existing literature addressing such applications aims at developing an offline algorithm for optimal battery deployment based on a known load profile (or accurately predicted) without taking into consideration real time conditions. This paper investigates the impact of industrial load forecasting errors on dispatching strategies of battery storage systems on economically driven peak shaving and Time-of-Use applications. An artificial neural network has been developed and used as a prediction model of an industrial load profile. The neural network was trained, validated and tested on historical load data with time resolution of 15 minutes, provided by the local distribution operator of the Belgian electric grid. The performance of the neural network in terms of output-target regression and mean absolute error is 0.833 and 10.02% respectively. Afterwards, a simulation was carried out comparing four different scenarios of peak shaving. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the presented neural network is not competitive enough. Peak shaving based on
predicted profiles becomes reliable for lower forecasting errors. For this purpose, further access into the process and types of loads of the user is required in order to come up with a more sophisticated prediction model",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Assessing the impact of load forecasting accuracy on battery dispatching strategies with respect to Peak Shaving and Time-of-Use (TOU) applications for industrial consumers,10.1109/upec.2017.8231939,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A detailed analysis of the various means to increase the percentage of processed data is provided and the experimental implementation of a way to obtain and preprocess data in a mobile device network in real-time mode is shown.During the analysis of the subject, the next fields of research were observed: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data, and GPGPU technology. The increasing numbers of publications, especially of papers that include mobile networks, were emphasized as evidence of rapid growth of the industry and a transition of neuron network algorithms toward mobile operating systems.Further analysis was focused on highlighting the most relevant and perspective objects for the research. The analysis showed that amidst currently most innovative and broadly widespread operation systems and frameworks to implement and engage neuron network algorithms Android operation system and TensorFlow framework has the most significant advantages.Due to the purpose of developing an experimental solution based on mobile device network and neuron network, different classes and types of neuron network architectures were explored. Two major types of mobile neuron networks such as quantized and integer neuron networks and the principal dissimilarity between them were described. Various neuron networks were tested on mobile devices with Internet connection via specially developed auxiliary software using GPGPU technology. Experimental results had shown that modern smartphones such as Huawei P20-Pro are capable to analyze, store and transmit the incoming from its camera sensor information at a rate of up to 40 frames per second. The usage of mobile GPU for improving the performance of the neuron networks was proved to be effective as such the number of frames processed by a neuron network per second can be elevated up to 10 times.The experimental software that task was to search for the given by user object in a real-time mode using mobile device network as both — server and processing nodes — proved to be a violable solution for the increasing amount of preprocessed up-to-the-minute information in the Big Data industry after the diligent research.As a summary, it needs to be stated that current progress in mobile device industry is making possible to bring neuron network technologies on mobile platforms and expand the capability of data aggregating services through the use of modern Deep Learning frameworks and GPGPU technology.Проаналізовано напрямки досліджень у галузі концептів Big Data, розподілених мереж мобільних пристроїв і Deep Learning.

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations. The latter can be used as maintenance directions by a human operator in charge of production monitoring and control",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"WHODID: Web-based interface for Human-assisted factory Operations in fault Detection, Identification and Diagnosis",10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_47,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In either case, clustering the sensor network’s nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network’s lifetime.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features.

395008361,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Human-robot collaboration could be advanced by facilitating the intuitive, gaze-based control of robots, and enabling robots to recognize human actions, infer human intent, and plan actions that support human goals. Traditionally, gaze tracking approaches to action recognition have relied upon computer vision-based analyses of two-dimensional egocentric camera videos. The objective of this study was to identify useful features that can be extracted from three-dimensional (3D) gaze behavior and used as inputs to machine learning algorithms for human action recognition. We investigated human gaze behavior and gaze-object interactions in 3D during the performance of a bimanual, instrumental activity of daily living: the preparation of a powdered drink. A marker-based motion capture system and binocular eye tracker were used to reconstruct 3D gaze vectors and their intersection with 3D point clouds of objects being manipulated. Statistical analyses of gaze fixation duration and saccade size suggested that some actions (pouring and stirring) may require more visual attention than other actions (reach, pick up, set down, and move). 3D gaze saliency maps, generated with high spatial resolution for six subtasks, appeared to encode action-relevant information. The ""gaze object sequence"" was used to capture information about the identity of objects in concert with the temporal sequence in which the objects were visually regarded. Dynamic time warping barycentric averaging was used to create a population-based set of characteristic gaze object sequences that accounted for intra- and inter-subject variability. The gaze object sequence was used to demonstrate the feasibility of a simple action recognition algorithm that utilized a dynamic time warping Euclidean distance metric. Averaged over the six subtasks, the action recognition algorithm yielded an accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 89.5%, and recall of 89.2%. This level of performance suggests that the gaze object sequence is a promising feature for action recognition whose impact could be enhanced through the use of sophisticated machine learning classifiers and algorithmic improvements for real-time implementation. Robots capable of robust, real-time recognition of human actions during manipulation tasks could be used to improve quality of life in the home and quality of work in industrial environments",,"eScholarship, University of California",Exploiting Three-Dimensional Gaze Tracking for Action Recognition During Bimanual Manipulation to Enhance Human-Robot Collaboration.,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Using big data to personalize an offering in real time, however, remains a major challenge. In the mobile advertising industry, once a customer enters the network, an ad-serving decision must be made in a matter of milliseconds. In this work, we describe the design and implementation of an ad-serving algorithm that incorporates machine-learning methods to make personalized ad-serving decisions within milliseconds. We developed this algorithm for Vungle Inc., one of the largest global mobile ad networks. Our approach also addresses other important issues that most ad networks face, such as user fatigue, budget restrictions, and campaign pacing. In an A/B test versus the company’s legacy algorithm, our algorithm generated a 23 percent increase in revenue per 1,000 impressions.

Following such early incidents, academic and public discussion on AI ethics has highlighted the need for implementing ethics in AI system development. However, little currently exists in the way of frameworks for understanding the practical implementation of AI ethics. In this paper, we discuss a research framework for implementing AI ethics in industrial settings.

This prototype is based on only four metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors suitable for IoT technology. The system architecture consists of four stages: data acquisition, data storage, data processing, and user interfacing. The designed eNose was tested with experiment for detection of volatile components in water pollution, as a dimethyl disulphide or dimethyl diselenide or sulphur. Therefore, the results provide evidence that odor information can be recognized with around 86% efficiency, detecting smells unwanted in the water and improving the quality control in bottled water factories.This work was supported by the I+D+i Program of the Generalitat Valenciana, Spain [AICO/2016/046], and the II Program UPV-La Fe [2013/0504].Climent-Martí, E.; Pelegrí Sebastiá, J.; Sogorb Devesa, T.; Talens-Felis, J.; Chilo, J.

275598738,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The bale collecting problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations in grain and other crops. Its solution defines the sequence of collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation-aid systems or auto-steering for agricultural vehicles and machines, is able to provide accurate data to make a reliable bale collecting planning. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approach to address the BCP pursuing resource optimization such as minimizing non-productive time, fuel consumption, or distance travelled. The algorithmic route generation provides the basis for a navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a set of instances similar to those found in real situations. In particular, comparative results show an average improving of a 16% from those obtained by previous heuristics.This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government (research project AGL2010-15334).Gracia Calandin, CP.; Diezma Iglesias, B.; Barreiro Elorza, P.

288551532,2019,"In proposing a machine learning approach for a flow shop scheduling problem with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking, this paper seeks to generate a tree-based priority rule in terms of a well-performing decision tree (DT) for dispatching jobs. Furthermore, generating a generic DT and RF that yields competitive results for instance scenarios that structurally differ from the training instances was another goal of our research. The proposed DT relies on high quality solutions, obtained using a constraint programming (CP) formulation. Novel aspects include a unified representation of job sequencing and machine assignment decisions, as well as the generation of random forests (RF) to counteract overfitting behaviour. To show the performance of the proposed approaches, different instance scenarios for two objectives (makespan and total tardiness minimisation) were implemented, based on randomised problem data. The background of this approach is a real-world physical system of an industrial partner that represents a typical shop floor for many production processes, such as furniture and window construction. The results of a comparison of the DT and RF approach with two priority dispatching rules, the original CP solutions and tight lower bounds retrieved from a strengthened mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation show that the proposed machine learning approach performs well in most instance sets for the makespan objective and in all sets for the total tardiness objective.© The Author(s) 201","[{'title': None, 'identifiers': [' 0171-6468', 'ISSN: 0171-6468']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"A machine learning approach for flow shop scheduling problems with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking",10.1007/s00291-019-00567-8,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

203923069,2016-12-31,"AbstractTransferring predictive microbial models from research into real world food manufacturing or risk assessment applications is still a challenge for members of the food safety modelling community. Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed strategy, existing predictive models previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models are made publicly available in the first community Food Safety Model Repository called openFSMR (https://sites.google.com/site/openfsmr/).This work illustrates that a standardized information exchange format for predictive microbial models can be established by adoption of resources from Systems Biology.

An exhaustive evaluation was performed to assess the best combination of spectral channels for this task. Three approaches based on a MobileNet topology were evaluated, using (a) the full image, (b) a sliding window, and (c) a precise localization method. The first method classifies an input image as containing a body or not, the second uses a sliding window to yield a class for each subimage, and the third uses transposed convolutions returning a binary output in which the body pixels are marked. In all cases, the MobileNet architecture was modified by adding custom layers and preprocessing the input to align the multispectral camera channels. Evaluation shows that the proposed methods yield reliable results, obtaining the best classification performance when combining green, red‐edge, and near‐infrared channels. We conclude that the precise localization approach is the most suitable method, obtaining a similar accuracy as the sliding window but achieving a spatial localization close to 1 m.

217586045,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Embedded vision is a disruptive new technology in the vision industry. It is a revolutionary concept with far reaching implications, and it is opening up new applications and shaping the future of entire industries. It is applied in self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles in agriculture, digital dermascopes that help specialists make more accurate diagnoses, among many other unique and cutting-edge applications. The design of such systems gives rise to new challenges for embedded Software developers. Embedded vision applications are characterized by stringent performance constraints to guarantee real-time behaviours and, at the same time, energy constraints to save battery on the mobile platforms. In this paper, we address such challenges by proposing an overall view of the problem and by analysing current solutions. We present our last results on embedded vision design automation over two main aspects: the adoption of the model-based paradigm for the embedded vision rapid prototyping, and the application of heterogeneous programming languages to improve the system performance.

286600336,2018-01-01T00:00:00,": Deep learning is the most recent approach to achieve artificial intelligence. Especially neural networks are used for solving many human problems - from repetitive operations to intelligent recognizing in image, sound and text processing. They are used in medicine, car industry, game industry and robotics. Business companies also try to find the way of exploitation of the latest technology despite the fact that it is the long way to the point where machines will be capable to replace the human intelligence. Authors of this paper explore possibilities of semi-supervised learning application in accounting. One of the latest deep learning algorithm is successfully used to reconstruct the journal entry key columns. The model was trained and tested on a real-world dataset so it could become base for developing the wide pallet of accounting and audit applications - as anomaly detection module of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software or as a standalone application",,,Journal entries with deep learning model,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275594362,2013-06-01T00:00:00,"Thanks to the built in intelligence (deployment of new intelligent devices and sensors in places where historically they were not present), the Smart Grid and Microgrid paradigms are able to take advantage from aggregated load forecasting, which opens the door for the implementation of new algorithms to seize this information for optimization and advanced planning. Therefore, accuracy in load forecasts will potentially have a big impact on key operation factors for the future Smart Grid/Microgrid-based energy network like user satisfaction and resource saving, and new methods to achieve an efficient prediction in future energy landscapes (very different from the centralized, big area networks studied so far). This paper proposes different improved models to forecast next day's aggregated load using artificial neural networks, taking into account the variables that are most relevant. In particular, seven models based on the multilayer perceptron will be proposed, progressively adding input variables after analyzing the influence of climate factors on aggregated load.

Replacing sklearn with a better performing framework would require re-evaluating and tuning hyperparameters from scratch. Instead we developed a python embedding in a C++ based server application that increased performance by up to 20x, achieving linear scalability up to a point of convergence.

322372256,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.Scopu",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier,10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Concept of Automated Vehicle in the era of the fourth industrial revolution is transforming from the `vehicle` that had its focal point in the hardware to the `portable computer` that has its focus in the software that processes broad range of digital information. The phenomenon in one aspect is innovation through scientific technology. However on the other hand, it is raising humanistic, philosophical and legal questions about how human life will change according to the technological and industrial transition. Age of `Artificial Intelligence` and `Posthuman` emerging through the development of technology is creating new concept of human and bringing forward the issue of new danger that is occurring when reason and physical abilities thought as the essence of `human` is being substituted by scientific technology and computer. The advocates of automated vehicle assert that it provides more safety and convenience to human. Such argument cannot be completely be false, and I wish to reach the same conclusion eventually. However, as other process of introducing new technology like nuclear energy tell us, to consider whether automated vehicle is more convenient and better than the previous vehicle system and whether there are no new danger that new technology is bringing about or overlooked elements of danger is severely important. Therefore, if certain danger is expected, technological prevention should be devised as a first step, and for the sections where technology and industry is not self-regulating, it is legislations and policies` role to lead and force to a human-friendly direction. Automated vehicle that is being discussed nowadays can be neutral itself and seem to be no more than a convenient device. However, since each automated vehicle is activated by entering massive amount of digital information and since it collects, stores, and distributes a welter of personal information when connected to Internet of Things(IoT), whole new danger from the previous era is created in terms of personal information and privacy. The ironic reality of surveillance society since the modern times that has assured freedom of an individual on the one hand and has reinforced utilitarian society control on the grounds of fully protecting one`s right and expanding welfare on the other lies beneath this near future. Especially, personal information is more being exposed and distributed and collection and surveillance of digital information is becoming easier in the information age. Automated vehicle system cannot be free from such exposure and danger of violating since it is operated with geolocation, video, and communication information as well. Moreover, since violation of personal information can lead to violation of privacy and human dignity, and damage the basic order of liberal democracy, arranging the frame of public regulation relating to personal information protection by researching U.S. and European Union legislation and seems more than necessary. Being awake is what sovereign needs in the digital era. Likewise, to secure right to personal information, we should remember to turn the monitoring lamp on in advance not only as an individual, but also as a group in order to obtain convenience and prevent danger of new era of automated vehicle.��� ��������� ��������������� ������������������������������ ���������������(HY-2014������)","[{'title': 'Korean Journal of Law and Society', 'identifiers': ['1227-0954', 'issn:1227-0954']}]",������������������������,Public Law Perspectives on Personal Information Protection in the Era of Automated Vehicle,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

144874233,2017-11-08,"This paper will describe and present results for a local flood risk reduction system which utilises existing in-network storage capacity to attenuate flow peaks. The storage capacity is mobilised through active flow control automatically regulated by an Artificial Intelligence system using local level monitoring.

The effects of climate change, population growth and urbanisation are putting increasing pressure on sewer and drainage networks both in the UK and overseas. The capacity of networks to cope with runoff at the required rate often falls short of requirements leading to localised floods and/or increased CSO spills to receiving waters. Smart Water/ Wastewater Network technologies have the potential to deliver improved service to customers and cost-effective performance improvements for the water industry.

CENTAUR aims to provide an innovative, cost effective, local autonomous data driven in-sewer flow control system whose operation will attenuate peaks and reduce the risk of surface water flooding. The system enables the capacity of existing infrastructure to be utilised more efficiently as a very economical alternative to capital-intensive solutions, for example building extra storage capacity. The system is also quick to implement with virtually no enabling works prior to installation.

CENTAUR comprises level monitors which relay data to an intelligent controller, which instructs a flow control device regulated by a novel and robust artificial intelligence routine based on Fuzzy Logic. The level monitors and intelligent controller are located locally and utilise real time data to provide effective real time control (RTC).

The CENTAUR Fuzzy Logic control algorithm was developed in Matlab. The Matlab RTC algorithm was linked to a SWMM hydro-dynamic model of a test network to prove its efficiency. Further rigorous testing was carried out by the University of Sheffield on the full-scale test facility designed to replicate field conditions. The CENTAUR system has been further developed and it is now implemented and fully functional in trial site in Coimbra, Portugal. Results of successful testing in the laboratory and the Coimbra field trial will be presented",,,CENTAUR: Smart Utilisation of Wastewater storage capacity to prevent flooding,10.5281/zenodo.1051199,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478671759,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration",,,Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In addition, sorghum cultivation is economically profitable and it does not contain the proteins that affect celiac patients. In the last years, a variety of ""free gluten"" food products were developed for improving the celiac diet, as well as sorghum beers, which are frequently produced in a home-made manner on a very small scale by individual brewers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a non-alcoholic beverage from sorghum. In this work, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a batch plant for producing malt drink from sorghum at industrial level is proposed. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, which is implemented and solved in GAMS using the CPLEX solver. Through experimental results, design and operation model parameters are obtained in order to develop real-fit formulation. The investment cost is minimized, and a technical-social-economical analysis is presented in order to evaluate the more profitable and sustainable option to produce malt drink from sorghum.

304332468,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Prognostic Health Management (PHM) is a maintenance policy aimed at predicting the occurrence of a failure in components and consequently minimizing unexpected downtimes of complex systems. Recent developments in condition monitoring (CM) techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools enabled the collection of a huge amount of data in real-time and its transformation into meaningful information that will support the maintenance decision-making process. The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies connect distributed physical systems with their virtual representations in the cyber computational world. The PHM assumes a key role in the implementation of CPS in manufacturing contexts, since it allows to keep CPS and its machines in proper conditions. On the other hand, CPS-based PHM provide an efficient solution to maximize availability of machines and production systems. In this paper, evolving and unsupervised approaches for the implementation of PHM at a component level are described, which are able to process streaming data in real-time and with almost-zero prior knowledge about the monitored component. A case study from a real industrial context is presented. Different unsupervised and online anomaly detection methods are combined with evolving clustering models in order to detect anomalous behaviours in streaming vibration data and integrate the so-generated knowledge into supervised and adaptive models; then, the degradation model for each identified fault is built and the resulting RUL prediction model integrated into the online analysis.

Here we sought to develop a new complete, low-cost and rapid (approximately 2·5\ua0h) detection system requiring minimal operator input.We observed a strong correlation between culture-based cell counts and our ability to detect either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli by loop-mediated isothermal amplification from the same samples. This knowledge was used to develop a rapid and simple five-step assay to quantify Campylobacter, which was subsequently assessed for its specificity, reproducibility and accuracy in quantifying Campylobacter levels from processed chickens. The assay was found to be highly specific for C. jejuni and C. coli and was capable of distinguishing between samples that are either within or exceeding the industry set target of 6000 Campylobacter colony forming units (CFU) per carcass (equivalent to 12\ua0CFU per ml of chicken rinse) with >90% accuracy relative to culture-based methods.Our method can reliably quantify Campylobacter counts of processed chickens with an accuracy comparable to culture-based assays but provides results within hours as opposed to days.The research presented here will help improve food safety by providing fast Campylobacter detection that will enable the implementation of real-time risk management strategies in poultry processing plants to rapidly test processed chickens and identify effective intervention strategies.

188688866,2018,"In the phase of industry digitalization, data are collected from many sensors and signal processing techniques play a crucial role. Data preprocessing is a fundamental step in the analysis of measurements, and a first step before applying machine learning. To reduce the influence of distortions from signals, selective digital filtering is applied to minimize or remove unwanted components. Standard software and hardware digital filtering algorithms introduce a delay, which has to be compensated for to avoid destroying signal associations. The delay from filtering becomes more crucial when the analysis involves measurements from multiple sensors, therefore in this paper we provide an overview and comparison of existing digital filtering methods with an application based on real-life marine examples. In addition, the design of special-purpose filters is a complex process and for preprocessing data from many sources, the application of digital filtering in the time domain can have a high numerical cost. For this reason we describe discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering as a tool for efficient sensor data preprocessing, which does not introduce a time delay and has low numerical cost. The discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering has a simpler implementation and does not require expert-level filter design knowledge, which is beneficial for practitioners from various disciplines. Finally, we exemplify and show the application of the methods on real signals from marine systems.acceptedVersion© 2018. This is the authors' accepted and refereed manuscript to the article.

286140236,2019-08-25T08:19:25,"Studying developers’ behavior in software development tasks is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers’ daily work. In modern software development, developers frequently use different applications including IDEs, Web Browsers, documentation software (such as Office Word, Excel, and PDF applications), and other tools to complete their tasks. This creates significant challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. Researchers usually instrument the software tools to log developers’ behavior for further studies. This is feasible for studies on development activities using specific software tools. However, instrumenting all software tools commonly used in real work settings is difficult and requires significant human effort. Furthermore, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. This abstraction is often performed manually or based on simple heuristics. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the above two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. First, we use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. ActivitySpace uses operating-system level instrumentation to track developer interactions with a wide range of applications in real work settings. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach to reduce the human effort to abstract low-level behavior data. Specifically, considering the sequential nature of the interaction data, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers’ low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To validate the generalizability of the proposed data collection approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner’s company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers’ one-week work in three actual software projects. The experiment with the collected data confirms that with initial human-labeled training data, the CRF model can be trained to infer development activities from low-level actions with reasonable accuracy within and across developers and software projects. This suggests that the machine learning approach is promising in reducing the human efforts required for behavior data analysis.This work was partially supported by NSFC Program (No. 61602403 and 61572426)","[{'title': 'Empirical Software Engineering', 'identifiers': ['issn:1382-3256', '1382-3256']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Inference of development activities from interaction with uninstrumented applications,10.1007/s10664-017-9547-8,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This research contributes to developing an on-line inspection system that would be far more cost effective than present methods and, moreover, assist manufacturers in checking the location of high density areas, defects and enable real time quality control, including the implementation of accept/reject criteria",,Elsevier,Ultrasonic sensor based defect detection and characterisation of ceramics,10.1016/j.ultras.2013.07.018,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
148683794,2015-06-03T00:00:00,"Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error. The artificial cognitive control architecture built into a low-cost computing platform demonstrates the suitability of its implementation in an industrial setup",,'Elsevier BV',Artificial cognitive control with self-x capabilities: A case study of a micro-manufacturing process,10.1016/j.compind.2015.05.001,https://core.ac.uk/download/148683794.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

288353915,2019-06-05T00:00:00,"Approximately one-third of the food produced globally is spoiled or wasted in the food supply chain (FSC). Essentially, it is lost before it even reaches the end consumer. Conventional methods of food waste tracking relying on paper-based logs to collect and analyse the data are costly, laborious, and time-consuming. Hence, an automated and real-time system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) concepts is proposed to measure the overall amount of waste as well as the reasons for waste generation in real-time within the potato processing industry, by using modern image processing and load cell technologies. The images captured through a specially positioned camera are processed to identify the damaged, unusable potatoes, and a digital load cell is used to measure their weight. Subsequently, a deep learning architecture, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is utilised to determine a potential reason for the potato waste generation. An accuracy of 99.79% was achieved using a small set of samples during the training test. We were successful enough to achieve a training accuracy of 94.06%, a validation accuracy of 85%, and a test accuracy of 83.3% after parameter tuning. This still represents a significant improvement over manual monitoring and extraction of waste within a potato processing line. In addition, the real-time data generated by this system help actors in the production, transportation, and processing of potatoes to determine various causes of waste generation and aid in the implementation of corrective actions",,,Monitoring potato waste in food manufacturing using image processing and Internet of Things approach,,https://core.ac.uk/download/288353915.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

method, in which the measurement of eye movement is based on eye blinks close

92690630,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Power grids are critical infrastructure assets that face non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft or faulty meters. NTL may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed in emerging countries. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly on-site inspections of customers. Electricity providers are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter's propensity to suggest a large number of unnecessary inspections. In this paper, we propose a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we propose a machine learning framework that classifies customers into NTL or non-NTL using a variety of features derived from the customers' consumption data. The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we propose a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram. Our approach allows domain experts to put the classification results into the context of the data and to incorporate their knowledge for making the final decisions of which customers to inspect. This work has resulted in appreciable results on a real-world data set of 3.6M customers.

This chain is still not consistently connected by means of information technologies. The design and the setup for each process in the chain are mostly done manually, using the experience of the operator. Computer aided systems (CAD/CAM) as widely used in the furniture industry are not in this field. The procedures are more complex and could not be automatized by the state of the art feature based algorithms. One attempt to solve the problem is the creation of a product data model that contains all information for the whole production process - not only geometrical data and tolerances but also semantic information (e.g. material, coating, batch size, etc.). Every process in the chain is now transforming the profile in a systematic and stochastic way. Both can be computed by the use of rules of artificial intelligence and tolerance calculations by means of statistical methods. Special CAM modules, which generate the specific process data, give also back the transformed profile and other necessary information to the superordinate product data model. The actual specific process data, for example for the process of profiling (e.g. setting parameters, pitch) can then be computed by a post processer using actual inputs as the geometry of the specified machine. The whole process chain can so be simulated before the real setup. The tools and processes can so be designed simultaneously in advance. The time for the production process can be reduced. This systematic is generating the same potentials as feature based CAD/CAM systems in the carcase furniture industry.

81111337,2016-12-31,"AbstractTransferring predictive microbial models from research into real world food manufacturing or risk assessment applications is still a challenge for members of the food safety modelling community. Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed.

144707204,2016-03-23,"Electricity markets are becoming more competitive, to some extent due to the increasing number of players that have moved from other sectors to the power industry. This is essentially resulting from incentives provided to distributed generation. Relevant changes in this domain are still occurring, such as the extension of national and regional markets to continental scales. Decision support tools have thereby become essential to help electricity market players in their negotiation process. This paper presents a metalearner to support electricity market players in bidding definition. The proposed metalearner uses a dynamic artificial neural network to create its own output, taking advantage on several learning algorithms already implemented in ALBidS (Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System). The proposed metalearner considers different weights for each strategy, based on their individual performance. The metalearner's performance is analysed in scenarios based on real electricity markets data using MASCEM (Multi-Agent Simulator for Competitive Electricity Markets). Results show that the proposed metalearner is able to provide higher profits to market players when compared to other current methodologies and that results improve over time, as consequence of its learning process",,,Metalearning to support competitive electricity market players' strategic bidding,10.1016/j.epsr.2016.03.012,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144707204.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Despite the opportunities AI technologies may offer, there is a real risk that without thoughtful intervention it may in fact exacerbate structural, economic, social, and political imbalances, and further reinforce entrenched inequalities. For regulators and policymakers around the world, uneven access to technology remains a major concern because of its potential impacts on social and economic inequality.

However, the recognition of gestures in video sequences is a problem still open, because current detection methods achieve low scores when the background is undefined or in unstructured scenarios. Deep learning techniques are being applied to approach a solution for this problem in recent years. In this paper, we present a study in which we analyse the performance of a 3DCNN architecture for hand gesture recognition in an unstructured scenario. The system yields a score of 73% in both accuracy and F1.

301258141,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"The discovery of a formal process model from event logs describing real process executions is a challenging problem that has been studied from several angles. Most of the contributions consider the extraction of a model as a one-class supervised learning problem where only a set of process instances is available. Moreover, the majority of techniques cannot generate complex models, a crucial feature in some areas like manufacturing. In this paper we present a fresh look at process discovery where undesired process behaviors can also be taken into account. This feature may be crucial for deriving process models which are less complex, fitting and precise, but also good on generalizing the right behavior underlying an event log. The technique is based on the theory of convex polyhedra and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and can be combined with other process discovery approach as a post processing step to further simplify complex models. We show in detail how to apply the proposed technique in combination with a recent method that uses numerical abstract domains.

Recent developments based on the concept of Industry 4.0 such as big data, new communication protocols and artificial intelligence provide several new avenues to explore. In the specific context of machining, we are working toward the development of a system capable of making the prognostic of the quality (in terms of dimensional conformance) of a workpiece in real time while it is being manufactured. The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms. In the end, this paper depicts the system architecture as well as its interactions between the multiple systems and software already in place at our industrial partner. This paper also shows preliminary results describing the relationship between the workpiece quality (in terms of respect toward the dimensional requirements) and the extracted features from the sensors signals. We conclude that it is now possible to do the diagnostic of a cutting operation. Additionally, with the same information we show that it is possible to quickly do the general diagnostic of the health state of the machine. Future work regarding this project will include data acquisition from a wider range of products (i.e. different shapes, materials, processes, etc.) and the development of a machine learning based prognostic model",,HAL CCSD,Toward the quality prognostic of an aircraft engine workpiece in Inconel Alloy 625: case study and proposed system architecture,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Injection moulding is a very complex process with several parameters having interactive
effects on each otherhence, computer-aided engineering and artificial intelligence were
utilised to optimise mould design based on weld line. Therefore, the finite element
analysis, artificial neural network and genetic algorithm were linked to find optimum gate
location in a plastic product. A reliable numerical model was developed by Moldflow
software based on a real product to simulate injection process. Moldflow was used to
predict weld line length and position of the part. Weld lines are visually undesirable and
a plastic part is structurally weak at weld line positions. This study describes how the
weld line was formed on the part. Polyamide-6 (PA-66) was used as the plastic material.
To find optimum gate location, the finite element predictions were implemented to train
a neural network, which was used later in the genetic algorithm. The optimisation
objective was to find gate location which led to minimum weld line length. This research
concluded that the developed procedure can efficiently optimise complex manufacturing

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations. The latter can be used as maintenance directions by a human operator in charge of production monitoring and control",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"WHODID: Web-based interface for Human-assisted factory Operations in fault Detection, Identification and Diagnosis",10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_47,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While Convolutional Neural Networks' accuracy has achieved a mature and remarkable state, inference latency and throughput are a major concern especially when targeting low-cost and low-power embedded platforms. CNNs' inference latency may become a bottleneck for Deep Learning adoption by industry, as it is a crucial specification for many real-time processes. Furthermore, deployment of CNNs across heterogeneous platforms presents major compatibility issues due to vendor-specific technology and acceleration libraries.In this work, we present QS-DNN, a fully automatic search based on Reinforcement Learning which, combined with an inference engine optimizer, efficiently explores through the design space and empirically finds the optimal combinations of libraries and primitives to speed up the inference of CNNs on heterogeneous embedded devices. We show that, an optimized combination can achieve 45x speedup in inference latency on CPU compared to a dependency-free baseline and 2x on average on GPGPU compared to the best vendor library.

237690220,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) there is a growing interest in the use of the Building Information Modelling (BIM). Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, BIM can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, BIM is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility Management (FM). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in FM. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of FM operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image Recognition (ImR), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data. This data has been stored in a BIM model, employed as single reliable source of information for FM. This integration can enhance maintenance management contracts if the BIM model is coupled with a smart contract. Far from being a comprehensive case study, this research demonstrates how the transition from BIM to the Asset Information Model (AIM) and, finally, to the Digital Twin (i.e. a near-real-time digital clone of a physical asset, of its conditions and processes) is desirable because of the outstanding benefits that have already been measured in other industrial sectors by applying the principles of Industry 4.0",,'WITPRESS LTD.',Office building occupancy monitoring through image recognition sensors,10.2495/SAFE-V9-N4-371-380,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

275634114,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay communications networks have emerged as a new paradigm for implementing distributed services in microgrids due to their potential benefits: they are robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, and they can route messages even with a large number of nodes which are frequently entering or leaving from the network. However, current P2P systems have been mainly developed for file sharing or cycle sharing applications where the processes of searching and managing resources are not optimized. Locality algorithms have gained a lot of attention due to their potential to provide an optimized path to groups with similar interests for routing messages in order to get better network performance. This paper develops a fully functional decentralized communication architecture with a new P2P locality algorithm and a specific protocol for monitoring and control of microgrids. Experimental results show that the proposed locality algorithm reduces the number of lookup messages and the lookup delay time. Moreover, the proposed communication architecture heavily depends of the lookup used algorithm as well as the placement of the communication layers within the architecture. Experimental results will show that the proposed techniques meet the network requirements of smart microgrids even with a large number of nodes on stream.This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant ENE2015-64087-C2-2R.

275613405,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"The inclusion of embedded sensors into a networked system provides useful
information for many applications. A Distributed Control System (DCS) is one of the
clearest examples where processing and communications are constrained by the client s
requirements and the capacity of the system. An embedded sensor with advanced
processing and communications capabilities supplies high level information, abstracting
from the data acquisition process and objects recognition mechanisms. The implementation
of an embedded sensor/actuator as a Smart Resource permits clients to access sensor
information through distributed network services. Smart resources can offer sensor services
as well as computing, communications and peripheral access by implementing a self-aware
based adaptation mechanism which adapts the execution profile to the context. On the
other hand, information integrity must be ensured when computing processes are
dynamically adapted. Therefore, the processing must be adapted to perform tasks in a
certain lapse of time but always ensuring a minimum process quality. In the same way,
communications must try to reduce the data traffic without excluding relevant information.
The main objective of the paper is to present a dynamic configuration mechanism to adapt
the sensor processing and communication to the client s requirements in the DCS. This
paper describes an implementation of a smart resource based on a Red, Green, Blue, and
Depth (RGBD) sensor in order to test the dynamic configuration mechanism presented.This work has been supported by the Spanish Science and Innovation Ministry MICINN under the CICYT project M2C2: ""Codiseno de sistemas de control con criticidad mixta basado en misiones"" TIN2014-56158-C4-4-P and the Programme for Research and Development PAID of the Polytechnic University of Valencia: UPV-PAID-FPI-2013.

This kind of strategy is important to deal with maintenance problems given the ever increasing need to reduce downtime and associated costs.

196646001,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is claimed to be a global booster technology for economic development. IIoT brings bulky use-cases with a simple goal of enabling automation, autonomation or just plain digitalization of industrial processes. The abundance of interconnected IoT and CPS generate additional burden on the telecommunication networks, imposing number of challenges to satisfy the key performance requirements. In particular, the QoS metrics related to real-time data exchange for critical machine-to-machine type communication. This paper analyzes a real-world example of IIoT from a QoS perspective, such as remotely operated underground mining vehicle. As part of the performance evaluation, a software tool is developed for estimating the absolute, one-way delay in end-toend transmissions. The measured metric is passed to a machine learning model for one-way delay prediction based on LTE RAN measurements using a commercially available cutting-edge software tool.

265120533,2019-12-13,"International audienceThe use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is still restricted to simulation or to enhance human-operated systems through recommendations. Real-world environments (e.g. industrial robots or power grids) are generally designed with safety constraints in mind implemented in the shape of valid actions masks or contingency controllers. For example, the range of motion and the angles of the motors of a robot can be limited to physical boundaries. Violating constraints thus results in rejected actions or entering in a safe mode driven by an external controller, making RL agents incapable of learning from their mistakes. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of a state-of-the-art deep RL algorithm (DQN), enabling learning from forbidden actions. To do so, the standard Q-learning update is enhanced with an extra safety loss inspired by structured classification. We empirically show that it reduces the number of hit constraints during the learning phase and accelerates convergence to near-optimal policies compared to using standard DQN.

226752432,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper reports the development of a manipulation system for electric wires, implemented by means of a commercial gripper installed on an industrial manipulator and equipped with cameras and suitably designed tactile sensors. The purpose of this system is the execution of wire insertion on commercial electromechanical components. The synergy between computer vision and tactile sensing is necessary because, in a real environment, the tight spaces very often prevent the possibility to use the vision system, also when the same task is performed by a human being. A novel technique to speed up the generation of training data sets for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Therefore, this technique is used to train a CNN in order to detect small objects (such as wire terminals). Moreover, aiming to prevent faults during the task and to interact with the environment safely, several machine learning approaches are used to produce an affordable output from the tactile sensor. The proposed approach shows how a cheap sensor embedded with suitable intelligence can provide information comparable to a more expensive force sensor. Note to Practitioners - This paper was motivated by the lack of commercial solution for the automatic cabling of switchgears. Existing approaches to this problem are in some way limited to specific large-scale products or simple layouts. This paper investigated a robust and flexible solution, based on the exploitation of multiple sensors and machine learning algorithms, for wire detection, grasping, and connection. The proposed approach is characterized by simple design and self-tuning capabilities, and it can be easily employed on a wide range of switchgear layouts thanks to the large workspace of the manipulator. Experimental results show that the proposed system is able to achieve a 95% success rate within a realistic admissible region. In the future research, we will integrate the proposed solution with an electromechanical component localization module and a terminal fastening system to evaluate the performance on the real production line",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Integration of robotic vision and tactile sensing for wire-terminal insertion tasks,10.1109/TASE.2018.2847222,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
442409320,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Within the strongly regulated avionic engineering field, conventional graphical desktop hardware and software application programming interface (API) cannot be used because they do not conform to the avionic certification standards. We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge. As proven by previous hardware emulation tools, there is also a potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine early in the development cycle. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by predictive software running on a desktop computer. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL Safety Critical API. First, we create nonparametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames per second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated. To validate our models, we render an industrial scene with characteristic combinations not used during the training phase and we compare the predictions to those real values. We find a median prediction error of less than 4 FPS","[{'title': 'Scientific Programming', 'identifiers': ['1058-9244', 'issn:1058-9244', '1875-919x', 'issn:1875-919X']}]",'Hindawi Limited',Avionics Graphics Hardware Performance Prediction with Machine Learning,10.1155/2019/9195845,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
83005667,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Purpose: The goal of this paper is to develop a pragmatic system of a production throughput
forecasting system for an automated test operation in a hard drive manufacturing plant. The
accurate forecasting result is necessary for the management team to response to any changes in
the production processes and the resources allocations.
Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we design a production throughput forecasting
system in an automated test operation in hard drive manufacturing plant. The proposed system
consists of three main stages. In the first stage, a mutual information method was adopted for
selecting the relevant inputs into the forecasting model. In the second stage, a generalized
regression neural network (GRNN) was implemented in the forecasting model development
phase. Finally, forecasting accuracy was improved by searching the optimal smoothing parameter
which selected from comparisons result among three optimization algorithms: particle swarm
optimization (PSO), unrestricted search optimization (USO) and interval halving optimization
(IHO).

41665747,2014-06-06T08:19:20,"In this article, a new and efficient multilayer neural networks learning algorithm is presented. The key concept of this new algorithm is the two-stage implementation of the steepest descendant method. At the first stage, the steepest descendant method is used to search the optimal learning constant eta and momentum term alpha for each weights updating process. At the second stage, the Delta learning rule is then employed to modify the connecting weights in terms of the optimal eta and alpha. Computer simulations show that the proposed new algorithm outmatches other learning algorithms both in converging speed and success rate. On real industrial application, we first apply the new neural network learning algorithm to the identification of a highly nonlinear injection molding barrel system. Experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm can precisely identify the complicate injection molding barrel system. Further more, a self-tuning PID controller for precise temperature control based on the trained neural network barrel model is developed. Real experiments show that the self-tuning PID controller can precisely control the barrel temperature within +/-0.5 degrees C","[{'title': 'JSME international journal Ser C Dynamics control robotics design and manufacturing', 'identifiers': ['issn:1340-8062', '1340-8062']}]",,Cascade steepest descendant learning algorithm for multilayer feedforward neural network,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most of the contributions consider the extraction of a model as a one-class supervised learning problem where only a set of process instances is available. Moreover, the majority of techniques cannot generate complex models, a crucial feature in some areas like manufacturing. In this paper we present a fresh look at process discovery where undesired process behaviors can also be taken into account. This feature may be crucial for deriving process models which are
less complex, fitting and precise, but also good on generalizing the right behavior underlying an event log. The technique is based on the theory of convex polyhedra and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and can be combined with other process discovery approach as a post processing step to further simplify complex models. We show in detail how to apply the proposed technique in combination with a recent method that uses numerical abstract domains. Experiments performed in a new prototype implementation show the effectiveness of the technique and the ability to be combined with other discovery techniques.status: publishe","[{'title': 'Information Sciences', 'identifiers': ['1872-6291', 'issn:1872-6291', 'issn:0020-0255', '0020-0255']}]",'Elsevier BV',Incorporating negative information to process discovery of complex systems,10.1016/j.ins.2017.09.027,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395142972,2019-08-11T00:00:00,"[EN] Modelling the dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles, such as buses or trucks, can be very useful for driving simulation and training, autonomous driving, crash analysis, etc. However, dynamic modelling of a vehicle is a difficult task because there are many subsystems and signals that affect its behaviour. In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

200772417,2019-06-01T00:00:00,"In this study, we use unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with multispectral cameras to search for bodies in maritime rescue operations. A series of flights were performed in open‐water scenarios in the northwest of Spain, using a certified aquatic rescue dummy in dangerous areas and real people when the weather conditions allowed it. The multispectral images were aligned and used to train a convolutional neural network for body detection. An exhaustive evaluation was performed to assess the best combination of spectral channels for this task. Three approaches based on a MobileNet topology were evaluated, using (a) the full image, (b) a sliding window, and (c) a precise localization method. The first method classifies an input image as containing a body or not, the second uses a sliding window to yield a class for each subimage, and the third uses transposed convolutions returning a binary output in which the body pixels are marked. In all cases, the MobileNet architecture was modified by adding custom layers and preprocessing the input to align the multispectral camera channels. Evaluation shows that the proposed methods yield reliable results, obtaining the best classification performance when combining green, red‐edge, and near‐infrared channels. We conclude that the precise localization approach is the most suitable method, obtaining a similar accuracy as the sliding window but achieving a spatial localization close to 1 m.

Woody biomass Moisture Content (MC) is a key parameter for controlling the biofuel product qualities and properties. In this paper, we are interested in predicting MC from data. The input impedance of half-wave dipole antenna when buried in the wood pile varies according to the permittivity of wood. Hence, the measurement of reflection coefficient, that gives information about the input impedance, depends directly on the MC of wood. The relationship between the reflection coefficient measurements and the MC is studied. Based upon this relationship, MC predictive models that use machine learning techniques and feature selection methods are proposed. Numerical experiments using real world data show the relevance of the proposed approach that requires a limited computational power.

197737176,2015-07-21T08:31:36,"none2The issue of monitoring profiles has been defined as being one of the most promising areas of research in statistical process control. One immediate difficulty is how to characterize a profile. As a matter of fact, the identification of a statistical model may become more difficult than expected, thus representing an obstacle to the introduction of profile monitoring in actual applications. For example, when a profile represents the physical dimensions of a machined surface, as it results in manufacturing applications, measurements data often exhibit complex spatial correlation.
The aim of this work is to explore a different approach for monitoring profiles, which uses the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network. The implementation of this neural network is based on a set of profiles which are representative of the process in its natural, or in-control, state.
Throughout the paper, a real case study related to profiles data obtained by a common machining process is used. With reference to the Phase II of profile monitoring, performance of the proposed approach are compared to those of multivariate control charting of the parameters vector. Although the proposed neural network does not produce always outperforming results, it presents comparable performance in several cases. The main advantage presented by the approach is that the model of profile data is “autonomously” derived by the neural network, without requiring any further intervention by the quality practitioner. This feature may create an important bridge between profile monitoring and quality monitoring of several specifications in actual applications.www.enbis.orgPacella M.; Semeraro Q.Pacella, Massimo; Semeraro, Q",,ENBIS,A comparison of neural network and control charting for monitoring profiles in manufacturing processes,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

288328958,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration.publishedVersio",,,Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,https://core.ac.uk/download/288328958.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
370074721,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The main goal of this paper is to study how machine learning models can fit this reliability estimation function in comparison with traditional approaches (e.g., Weibull distribution).

Particularly, four diverse machine learning approaches are implemented: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, and soft computing methods. We evaluate if there is one approach that outperforms the others when predicting the reliability of all the components, analyze if machine learning models improve their performance in the presence of censored data, and finally, understand the performance impact when the number of available inputs changes. Our experimental results show the high ability of machine learning to predict the component reliability and particularly, random forest, which generally obtains high accuracy and the best results for all the cases.

It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks",,"Ekonomski fakultet, Univerzitet u Istočnom Sarajevu",FINANCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE FIFTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,10.7251/ZREFIS1919067G,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287192453.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

is very important because their deterioration may cause the value lost and even
the product rejection by the buyer. For this reason, in this paper we present a
cooperative monitoring system for the delivery of fresh products. The system
consists of fixed wireless nodes and a mobile wireless node that is installed in
the packet. This mobile node is able to take data of the internal temperature,
external temperature and the 3 axis movement. With the information stored in
the network, a vendor can know the optimal conditions of the transport. Finally,
we test the maximum distance to the fixed nodes, as well as the data collected by
the sensor.Sendra, S.; Lloret, J.; Lacuesta, R.; Jimenez, JM. (2015). Cooperative Monitoring of the Delivery of Fresh Products.
