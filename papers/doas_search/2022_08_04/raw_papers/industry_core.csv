289160157,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Hyper-heuristic is a new methodology for the adaptive hybridization of meta-heuristic algorithms to derive a general algorithm for solving optimization problems. This work focuses on the selection type of hyper-heuristic, called the exponential Monte Carlo with counter (EMCQ). Current implementations rely on the memory-less selection that can be counterproductive as the selected search operator may not (historically) be the best performing operator for the current search instance. Addressing this issue, we propose to integrate the memory into EMCQ for combinatorial t-wise test suite generation using reinforcement learning based on the Q-learning mechanism, called Q-EMCQ. The limited application of combinatorial test generation on industrial programs can impact the use of such techniques as Q-EMCQ. Thus, there is a need to evaluate this kind of approach against relevant industrial software, with a purpose to show the degree of interaction required to cover the code as well as finding faults. We applied Q-EMCQ on 37 real-world industrial programs written in Function Block Diagram (FBD) language, which is used for developing a train control management system at Bombardier Transportation Sweden AB. The results show that Q-EMCQ is an efficient technique for test case generation. Addition- ally, unlike the t-wise test suite generation, which deals with the minimization problem, we have also subjected Q-EMCQ to a maximization problem involving the general module clustering to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show the Q-EMCQ is also capable of outperforming the original EMCQ as well as several recent meta/hyper-heuristic including modified choice function, Tabu high-level hyper-heuristic, teaching learning-based optimization, sine cosine algorithm, and symbiotic optimization search in clustering quality within comparable execution time",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An evaluation of Monte Carlo-based hyper-heuristic for interaction testing of industrial embedded software applications,10.1007/s00500-020-04769-z,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

322738580,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An important research problem in artificial intelligence is how to organize multiple agents, and coordinate them, so that they can work together to solve problems. Coordinating agents in a multi-agent system can significantly affect the systems performance-the agents can, in many instances, be organized so that they can solve tasks more efficiently, and consequently benefit collectively and individually. Central to this endeavor is coalition formation-the process by which heterogeneous agents organize and form disjoint groups (coalitions). Coalition formation often involves finding a coalition structure (an exhaustive set of disjoint coalitions) that maximizes the systems potential performance (e.g., social welfare) through coalition structure generation. However, coalition structure generation typically has no notion of goals. In cooperative settings, where coordination of multiple coalitions is important, this may generate suboptimal teams for achieving and accomplishing the tasks and goals at hand. With this in mind, we consider simultaneously generating coalitions of agents and assigning the coalitions to independent alternatives (e.g., tasks/goals), and present an anytime algorithm for the simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment problem. This combinatorial optimization problem hasmany real-world applications, including forming goal-oriented teams. To evaluate the presented algorithms performance, we present five methods for synthetic problem set generation, and benchmark the algorithm against the industry-grade solver CPLEXusing randomized data sets of varying distribution and complexity. To test its anytime-performance, we compare the quality of its interim solutions against those generated by a greedy algorithm and pure random search. Finally, we also apply the algorithm to solve the problem of assigning agents to regions in a major commercial strategy game, and show that it can be used in game-playing to coordinate smaller sets of agents in real-time.Funding Agencies|Linkoping University; Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An anytime algorithm for optimal simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment,10.1007/s10458-020-09450-1,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429122164,2020-08-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The paper presents the results of the Battle of Postdisaster Response and Restoration (BPDRR) presented in a special session at the first International water distribution systems analysis & computing and control in the water industry (WDSA/CCWI) Joint Conference, held in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in July 2018. The BPDRR problem focused on how to respond and restore water service after the occurrence of five earthquake scenarios that cause structural damage in a water distribution system. Participants were required to propose a prioritization schedule to fix the damages of each scenario while following restrictions on visibility/nonvisibility of damages. Each team/approach was evaluated against six performance criteria: (1) time without supply for hospital/firefighting, (2) rapidity of recovery, (3) resilience loss, (4) average time of no user service, (5) number of users without service for eight consecutive hours, and (6) water loss. Three main types of approaches were identified from the submissions: (1) general-purpose metaheuristic algorithms, (2) greedy algorithms, and (3) ranking-based prioritizations. All three approaches showed potential to solve the challenge efficiently. The results of the participants showed that for this network, the impact of a large-diameter pipe failure on the network is more significant than several smaller pipes failures. The location of isolation valves and the size of hydraulic segments influenced the resilience of the system during emergencies. On average, the interruptions to water supply (hospitals and firefighting) varied considerably among solutions and emergency scenarios, highlighting the importance of private water storage for emergencies. The effects of damages and repair work were more noticeable during the peak demand periods (morning and noontime) than during the low-flow periods; and tank storage helped to preserve functionality of the network in the first few hours after a simulated event.

480211410,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Credit card fraud jeopardizes the trust of customers in e-commerce transactions. This led in recent years to major advances in the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with short reaction time and high precision. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of the fraud behavior makes it difficult to tailor existing systems to different contexts (e.g. new payment systems, different countries and/or population segments). Given the high cost (research, prototype development, and implementation in production) of designing data-driven FDSs, it is crucial for transactional companies to define procedures able to adapt existing pipelines to new challenges. From an AI/machine learning perspective, this is known as the problem of transfer learning. This paper discusses the design and implementation of transfer learning approaches for e-commerce credit card fraud detection and their assessment in a real setting. The case study, based on a six-month dataset (more than 200 million e-commerce transactions) provided by the industrial partner, relates to the transfer of detection models developed for a European country to another country. In particular, we present and discuss 15 transfer learning techniques (ranging from naive baselines to state-of-the-art and new approaches), making a critical and quantitative comparison in terms of precision for different transfer scenarios. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we show that the accuracy of many transfer methods is strongly dependent on the number of labeled samples in the target domain and (ii) we propose an ensemble solution to this problem based on self-supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation classifiers. The thorough experimental assessment shows that this solution is both highly accurate and hardly sensitive to the number of labeled samples",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Transfer Learning Strategies for Credit Card Fraud Detection,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104472,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To accelerate embedding ML in more applications and incorporating it in real-world scenarios, automated machine learning (AutoML) is emerging. The main purpose of AutoML is to provide seamless integration of ML in various industries, which will facilitate better outcomes in everyday tasks. In healthcare, AutoML has been already applied to easier settings with structured data such as tabular lab data. However, there is still a need for applying AutoML for interpreting medical text, which is being generated at a tremendous rate. For this to happen, a promising method is AutoML for clinical notes analysis, which is an unexplored research area representing a gap in ML research. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive survey and analytical study towards AutoML for clinical notes. To that end, we first introduce the AutoML technology and review its various tools and techniques. We then survey the literature of AutoML in the healthcare industry and discuss the developments specific to clinical settings, as well as those using general AutoML tools for healthcare applications. With this background, we then discuss challenges of working with clinical notes and highlight the benefits of developing AutoML for medical notes processing. Next, we survey relevant ML research for clinical notes and analyze the literature and the field of AutoML in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, we propose future research directions and shed light on the challenges and opportunities this emerging field holds.

Recent developments in condition monitoring (CM) techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools enabled the collection of a huge amount of data in real-time and its transformation into meaningful information that will support the maintenance decision-making process. The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies connect distributed physical systems with their virtual representations in the cyber computational world. The PHM assumes a key role in the implementation of CPS in manufacturing contexts, since it allows to keep CPS and its machines in proper conditions. On the other hand, CPS-based PHM provide an efficient solution to maximize availability of machines and production systems.
In this paper, evolving and unsupervised approaches for the implementation of PHM at a component level are described, which are able to process streaming data in real-time and with almost-zero prior knowledge about the monitored component. A case study from a real industrial context is presented. Different unsupervised and online anomaly detection methods are combined with evolving clustering models in order to detect anomalous behaviors in streaming vibration data and integrate the so-generated knowledge into supervised and adaptive models; then, the degradation model for each identified fault is built and the resulting RUL prediction model integrated into the online analysis.

479180866,2021-07-01T00:00:00,"This interdisciplinary article presents a concept of the 21st century and phenomena that are products of the 4th industrial revolution – big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies – as well as the opportunities of their application in public governance and social policy. This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of big data, problems of data collection, its reliability and use. Big data can be used for the analysis and modeling of phenomena relevant to public governance and social policy. Big data consist of three main types: a) historical data, b) present data with little delay, c) prognostic data for future forecasting. The following categories of big data can be defined as: a) data from social networks, b) traditional data from business systems, c) machine-generated data, such as water extraction, pollution, satellite information. The article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of big data. There are big data challenges such as data security, lack of cooperation in civil service and social work, in rare situations – data fragmentation, incompleteness and erroneous issues, as well as ethical issues regarding the analysis of data and its use in social policy and social administration.


Big data, covered by Artificial Intelligence, can be used in public governance and social policy by identifying “the hot spots” of various phenomena, by prognosing the meanings of variables in the future on the basis of past time rows, and by calculating the optimal motion of actions in the situations where there are possible various alternatives. The technologies of Artificial Intelligence are used more profoundly in many spheres of public policy, and in the governance of COVID-19 pandemics too.


The substantial advantages of the provided big data and Artificial Intelligence are a holistic improvement of public services, possibilities of personalization, the enhancement of citizen satisfaction, the diminishing of the costs of processing expenditure, the targeting of adopted and implemented decisions, more active involvement of citizens, the feedback of the preferences of policy formation and implementation, the observation of social phenomenas in real time, and possibilities for more detailed prognosing.


Challenges to security of data, necessary resources and competences, the lack of cooperation in public service, especially rare instances of data fragmentation, roughness, falseness, and ethical questions regarding data analysis and application can be evaluated as the most significant problems of using big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.

This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.Методы машинного интеллекта с обучением вносят свою специфику к созданию и наладке игровой системы.Одна из главных проблем — это необходимость предвидения всего набора входных ситуаций и возможных ответов на моменте проектирования и невозможность расширения их списка без переобучения.

347169206,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"International audienceSuccessful development of a micro-total-analysis system (μTAS, lab-on-a-chip) is strictly related to the degree of miniaturization, integration, autonomy, sensitivity, selectivity, and repeatability of its detector. Fluorescence sensing is an optical detection method used for a large variety of biological and chemical assays, and its full integration within lab-on-a-chip devices remains a challenge. Important achievements were reported during the last few years, including improvements of previously reported methodologies, as well as new integration strategies. However, a universal paradigm remains elusive. This review considers achievements in the field of fluorescence sensing miniaturization, starting from off-chip approaches, representing miniaturized versions of their lab counter-parts, continuing gradually with strategies that aim to fully integrate fluorescence detection on-chip, and reporting the results around integration strategies based on optical-fiber-based designs,optical layer integrated designs, CMOS-based fluorescence sensing, and organic electronics. Further successful development in this field would enable the implementation of sensing networks in specific environments that, when coupled to Internet of-Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), could provide real-time data collection and, therefore, revolutionize fields like health, environmental, and industrial sensing",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Miniaturization of fluorescence sensing in optofluidic devices,10.1007/s10404-020-02371-1,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395143270,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Systems engineering is an ubiquitous discipline of Engineering overlapping industrial, chemical, mechanical, manufacturing, control, software, electrical, and civil engineering. It provides tools for dealing with the complexity and dynamics related to the optimisation of physical, natural, and virtual systems management. This paper presents a review of how multi-agent systems and complex networks theory are brought together to address systems engineering and management problems. The review also encompasses current and future research directions both for theoretical fundamentals and applications in the industry. This is made by considering trends such as mesoscale, multiscale, and multilayer networks along with the state-of-art analysis on network dynamics and intelligent networks. Critical and smart infrastructure, manufacturing processes, and supply chain networks are instances of research topics for which this literature review is highly relevant.This research was funded by the EPSRC and BT Prosperity Partnership project: Next Generation Converged Digital Infrastructure, grant number EP/R004935/1.Herrera, M.; Pérez-Hernández, M.; Parlikad, AK.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

This paper presents an intelligent system capable of deciding which countermeasures to take in order to mitigate an intrusion in a software defined network. The interaction between the intruder and the defender is posed as a Markov game and MuZero algorithm is used to train the model through self-play. Once trained, the model is integrated with an SDN controller, so that it is able to apply the countermeasures of the game in a real network. To measure the performance of the model, attackers and defenders with different training steps have been confronted and the scores obtained by each of them, the duration of the games and the ratio of games won have been collected. The results show that the defender is capable of deciding which measures minimize the impact of the intrusion, isolating the attacker and preventing it from compromising key machines in the network.This work was supported in part by the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) through the Project EGIDA-RED DE EXCELENCIA EN TECNOLOGIAS DE SEGURIDAD Y PRIVACIDAD under Grant CER20191012, in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under Grant PID2019-104966GB-I00, in part by the Basque Business Development Agency (SPRI)-Basque Country Government ELKARTEK Program through the projects TRUSTIND under Grant KK-2020/00054 and 3KIA under Grant KK-2020/00049, and in part by the Basque Country Program of Grants for Research Groups under Grant IT-1244-19",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Towards Autonomous Defense of SDN Networks Using MuZero Based Intelligent Agents,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100706,https://core.ac.uk/download/479999354.pdf,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They try to take advantage of the power of this technology in order to increase the level of automation and to build smarter machines with new capabilities of self-adaptation and self-control. Especially, the automotive industry, with their high requirements in productivity and diversity management, are eager to adapt AI concepts to their processes. However, the training of Deep Learning (DL) models requires an important effort of data preparation, providing a dataset of all possible configurations. Indeed, this dataset must be collected and then annotated. Considering the fact that automotive industry deals with a huge number of references and that it often and quickly needs to modify their products, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to gather sufficient datasets for each produced reference and to have the time to train DL models in the plants with the traditional methods. This paper presents an innovative methodology to prepare the dataset by creating virtual images instead of collecting real ones and then automatically annotating them. It will demonstrate that this method will reduce the efforts and the time of the preparation of the dataset significantly.

We propose better Cloud-based fluid distribution imaging to allow better, more optimized production, thus reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint per barrel produced. For CO2 storage, the location knowledge of the stored fluids is mandatory. Electromagnetics is the preferred way to image reservoir fluids due to its strong coupling to the fluid resistivity. Unfortunately, acquiring and interpreting the data takes too long to contribute significantly to cost optimization of field operations. Using artificial intelligence and Cloud based data acquisition we can reduce the operational feedback to near real time and even, for the interpretation, to close to 24 h. This then opens new doors for the breakthrough of this technology from exploration to production and monitoring. It allows the application envelope to be enlarged to much noisier environments where real time acquisition can be optimized based on the acquired data.

This paper addresses a binary classification problem found in manufacturing engineering, which focuses on how to ensure product quality delivery and at the same time to reduce production costs. The aim behind this problem is to predict the number of faulty products, which in this case is extremely low. As a result of this characteristic, the problem is reduced to an imbalanced binary classification problem. The authors contribute to imbalanced classification research in three important ways. First, the industrial application coming from the electronic manufacturing industry is presented in detail, along with its data and modelling challenges. Second, a modified cost-sensitive classification strategy based on a combination of Voronoi diagrams and genetic algorithm is applied to tackle this problem and is compared to several base classifiers. The results obtained are promising for this specific application. Third, in order to evaluate the flexibility of the strategy, and to demonstrate its wide range of applicability, 25 real-world data sets are selected from the KEEL repository with different imbalance ratios and number of features. The strategy, in this case implemented without a predefined cost, is compared with the same base classifiers as those used for the industrial problem",Expert Systems with Applications,Cost-sensitive learning classification strategy for predicting product failures,10.17863/CAM.53829,https://core.ac.uk/download/326250378.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Several factors as alignments, shiftsor masks rotations can lead to errors during the front-end step (waferfabrication), or others causes such as fingerprints, scratches and stainscan cause cosmetic damage during the back-end step (silicon packaging).Therefore, an automatic visual inspection is required to ensure that the partsare free of any defects.

Project organizations and machine learning practitioners face manifold challenges and risks when developing machine learning applications and have a need for guidance to meet business expectations. This paper therefore proposes a process model for the development of machine learning applications, covering six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. Business and data understanding are executed simultaneously in the first phase, as both have considerable impact on the feasibility of the project. The next phases are comprised of data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Special focus is applied to the last phase, as a model running in changing real-time environments requires close monitoring and maintenance to reduce the risk of performance degradation over time. With each task of the process, this work proposes quality assurance methodology that is suitable to address challenges in machine learning development that are identified in the form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature, and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support, but fails to address machine learning specific tasks.

481224283,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"In the travel insurance industry, cancel-for-any-reason insurance, also known as a cancellation protection service (CPS), is a recent attempt to strike a balance between customer satisfaction and service provider (SP) profits. However, some exceptional circumstances, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a dramatic decrease in SP revenues, especially for non-refundable tickets purchased early with CPS. This paper begins by presenting a risk group segmentation of customers in an online ticket reservation system. Then, a CPS fee is recommended depending on the different customer risk groups provided by the cluster segmentation via different clustering algorithms such as centroid-based K-means, hierarchical agglomerative, DBSCAN, and artificial neural network-based SOM algorithms. According to the implemented cluster metrics, which include the Silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index, Entropy index, and DBCV index, the SOM algorithm presents the most appropriate result. After predicting the new customer cluster, a CPS fee will be calculated with the proposed adaptive CPS method based on the cluster segmentation weights. Determining the weight of each cluster is related to the total CPS revenue threshold for all clusters defined by the SP. Therefore, to avoid a loss for SPs, the total CPS revenue will be kept constant with the threshold that the SP has been adjusted. The experimental results based on real-world data show that the risk group segmentation of customers helps to maintain a balance between CPS fees and SP profits. Finally, according to the calculated weights, the proposed model pegs the SP gain/loss variation with a 0.00012 exchange ratio",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Cancel-for-Any-Reason Insurance Recommendation Using Customer Transaction-Based Clustering,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064929,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The adoption and implementation of Industry 4.0, however, require to overcome a number of practical challenges, in most cases, due to the lack of modernisation and automation in place with traditional manufacturers. This paper presents a first of its kind case study for moving a traditional food manufacturer, still using the machinery more than one hundred years old, a common occurrence for small- and medium-sized businesses, to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies. The paper reports the challenges we have encountered during the transformation process and in the development stage. The paper also presents a smart production control system that we have developed by utilising AI, machine learning, Internet of things, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems and cloud computing technologies. The system provides novel data collection, information extraction and intelligent monitoring services, enabling improved efficiency and consistency as well as reduced operational cost. The platform has been developed in real-world settings offered by an Innovate UK-funded project and has been integrated into the company’s existing production facilities. In this way, the company has not been required to replace old machinery outright, but rather adapted the existing machinery to an entirely new way of operating. The proposed approach and the lessons outlined can benefit similar food manufacturing industries and other SME industries",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Towards design and implementation of Industry 4.0 for food manufacturing,10.1007/s00521-021-05726-z,https://core.ac.uk/download/384308353.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Automobile industry researchers, including manufacturers, seek to solve this issue with various technical solutions that can avoid such a situation. This paper proposes an implementation of a lightweight method to detect driver's sleepiness using facial landmarks and head pose estimation based on neural network methodologies on a mobile device. We try to improve the accurateness by using face images that the camera detects and passes to CNN to identify sleepiness. Firstly, applied a behavioral landmark's sleepiness detection process. Then, an integrated Head Pose Estimation technique will strengthen the system's reliability. The preliminary findings of the tests demonstrate that with real-time capability, more than 86% identification accuracy can be reached in several real-world scenarios for all classes, including with glasses, without glasses, and light-dark background. This work aims to classify drowsiness, warn, and inform drivers, helping them to stop falling asleep at the wheel. The integrated CNN-based method is used to create a high accuracy and simple-to-use real-time driver drowsiness monitoring framework for embedded devices and Android phone",Technische Universitat Chemnitz,Drowsiness Classification for Internal Driving Situation Awareness on Mobile Platform,10.14464/ess.v8i2.491,https://core.ac.uk/download/490595850.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
493124459,2022-01-31T00:00:00,"[EN] The concept of Servitization has been constantly developing since its outset, but in the last decade due to the irruption of Industry 4.0, the complexity of the concept and its typologies of value propositions have evolved considerably, opening up endless opportunities. In this sense, the main objective of this research is to show a summary review of the evolution of Servitization since its beginnings and the new typologies that are emerging due to the digitalization that arises through Industry 4.0. For this purpose, a systematic review of the leading databases in the field of services has been conducted. The results of the literature review show the potential of Servitization and the need to understand each reality in order to adapt to new capabilities that help the companies who become service-oriented benefit from major advantages. Ultimately, it can be concluded that, in the short term, Industry 4.0 and its new business models are the key, however, Servitization will continue to evolve to a point where all organizations will need to adapt to new trends.Ruiz De La Torre, A.; Sanchez, D.

Traditional manual disease-monitoring methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and ineffective. Therefore, an efficient method is urgently needed for real-time dynamic monitoring of orchard grape diseases. The classical deep learning network can achieve high accuracy in recognizing grape leaf diseases; however, the large amount of model parameters requires huge computing resources, and it is difficult to deploy to actual application scenarios. To solve the above problems, a cross-channel interactive attention mechanism-based lightweight model (ECA-SNet) is proposed. First, based on 6,867 collected images of five common leaf diseases of measles, black rot, downy mildew, leaf blight, powdery mildew, and healthy leaves, image augmentation techniques are used to construct the training, validation, and test set. Then, with ShuffleNet-v2 as the backbone, an efficient channel attention strategy is introduced to strengthen the ability of the model for extracting fine-grained lesion features. Ultimately, the efficient lightweight model ECA-SNet is obtained by further simplifying the network layer structure. The model parameters amount of ECA-SNet 0.5× is only 24.6% of ShuffleNet-v2 1.0×, but the recognition accuracy is increased by 3.66 percentage points to 98.86%, and FLOPs are only 37.4 M, which means the performance is significantly better than other commonly used lightweight methods. Although the similarity of fine-grained features of different diseases image is relatively high, the average F1-score of the proposed lightweight model can still reach 0.988, which means the model has strong stability and anti-interference ability. The results show that the lightweight attention mechanism model proposed in this paper can efficiently use image fine-grained information to diagnose orchard grape leaf diseases at a low computing cost",'Frontiers Media SA',Fine-Grained Grape Leaf Diseases Recognition Method Based on Improved Lightweight Attention Network,10.3389/fpls.2021.738042,https://core.ac.uk/download/490887727.pdf,"[{'title': 'Frontiers in Plant Science', 'identifiers': ['1664-462x', 'issn:1664-462X']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, the energy sector is one of those that has taken more advantages from the implementation of AI approaches, especially Machine Learning models, for several applications, including energy performance benchmarking of buildings. However, the black-box approach could lead to a lack of result interpretability thus preventing the effective application of AI in some real-world scenarios. For this reason, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools can be effectively embedded within an AI-based Energy Analytics methodology in order to enhance the explainability of the model results. In this paper, we propose an explainable AI-based benchmarking framework for estimating the membership to specific energy performance classes of a large set of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) of flats. The classification is obtained by leveraging different black-box classifiers characterized by high accuracy, yet their inference mechanism is not human-readable. Therefore, a generalizable XAI methodology, based on the combination of a local explainer together with a clustering algorithm, is employed to explain the model results and causal effects between the predictors and target variable to better understand the model behaviour, and the motivations behind correct and wrong performed classifications. The paper provides a general methodological approach capable to exploit a limited number of instances to extract, explain and interpret inference mechanisms learnt by the model that are useful for the end-user.

This new thirst for accurate and timely data has forced the convergence of the traditionally business-focused information technology (IT) environment with the production-focused operational technology (OT). Recently, software-defined network (SDN) methodologies have benefitted OT networks with enhanced situational awareness, centralized configuration, deny-by-default forwarding rules, and increased performance. What makes SDNs so innovative is the separation between the control plane and the data plane, centralizing the command in the controllers. However, due to their young age, the use of SDNs in the industry context has not yet matured comprehensive SDN-based architectures for IT/OT networks, which are also resistant to security attacks such as denial-of-service ones, which may occur in SDN-based industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. One main motivation is that the lack of comprehensive SDN-based architectures for IT/OT networks making it difficult to effectively simulate, analyze, and identify proper detection and mitigation strategies for DoS attacks in IT/OT networks. No consolidated security solutions are available that provide DoS detection and mitigation strategies in IT/OT networks. Along this direction, this paper’s contributions are twofold. On the one hand, this paper proposes a convergent IT/OT SDN-based architecture applied in a real implementation of an IT/OT support infrastructure called SIRDAM4.0 within the context of the SBDIOI40 project. On the other hand, this paper proposes a qualitative analysis on how this architecture works under DoS attacks, focusing on what the specific problems and vulnerabilities are. In particular, we simulated several distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack scenarios within the context of the proposed architecture to show the minimum effort needed by the attacker to hack the network, and our obtained experimental results show how it is possible to compromise the network, thus considerably worsening the performance and, in general, the functioning of the network.

Recent advancements in deep learning techniques allowed a significant improvement in detection accuracy and latency of modern neural networks, allowing their adoption in automotive, avionics and industrial embedded systems, where performances are required to meet size, weight and power constraints.Multiple benchmarks and surveys exist to compare state-of-the-art detection networks, profiling important metrics, like precision, latency and power efficiency on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) embedded platforms. However, we observed a fundamental lack of fairness in the existing comparisons, with a number of implicit assumptions that may significantly bias the metrics of interest. This includes using heterogeneous settings for the input size, training dataset, threshold confidences, and, most importantly, platform-specific optimizations, that are especially important when assessing latency and energy-related values.

One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption.

Detection techniques for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have gained a lot of attention in both academia and industry. Detection techniques have a significant impact on the massive MIMO receivers’ performance and complexity. Although a plethora of research is conducted using the classical detection theory and techniques, the performance is deteriorated when the ratio between the numbers of antennas and users is relatively small. In addition, most of classical detection techniques are suffering from severe performance loss and/or high computational complexity in real channel scenarios. Therefore, there is a significant room for fundamental research contributions in data detection based on the deep learning (DL) approach. DL architectures can be exploited to provide optimal performance with similar complexity of conventional detection techniques. This paper aims to provide insights on DL based detectors to a generalist of wireless communications. We garner the DL based massive MIMO detectors and classify them so that a reader can find the differences between various architectures with a wider range of potential solutions and variations. In this paper, we discuss the performance-complexity profile, pros and cons, and implementation stiffness of each DL based detector’s architecture.

Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria.

With innovative focus, the main constraint that will be addressed in this paper, and that usually is not considered, is the energy consumption cost in the production line. For that, an approach based on genetic algorithms is proposed and implemented. The use of local energy generation, especially from renewable sources, and the possibility of having multiple energy providers allow the user to manage its consumption according to energy prices and energy availability. The proposed solution takes into account the energy availability of renewable sources and energy prices to optimize the scheduling of a production line using a genetic algorithm with multiple constraints.

Effective product tracking endorses data integration and productivity improvements throughout the manufacturing processes. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are used in many tracking cases, but in some manufacturing environments, those cannot be used as they might get damaged or removed during processing. In this paper, we propose an alternative visual product tracking system. The physical system uses two cameras placed at the two ends of the tracked process(es). Product pairs are then matched with a Siamese neural network operating on the product images and trained offline on the problem at hand with labeled data. The proposed system can track products solely based on their visual appearance and without any physical interference with the products or production processes. Unlike other existing image-based methods, the proposed system is invariant to major positional and visual changes in the products. As a proof-of-concept, we tested the proposed system with real plywood factory data and were able to track the products with 98.5 % accuracy in a realistic test scenario.

This is due to the infinite amount of possible state configurations caused by the deformations of the deformable object. Engineered approaches try to cope with this by implementing highly complex operations in order to estimate the state of the deformable object. This complexity can be circumvented by utilizing learning-based approaches, such as reinforcement learning, which can deal with the intrinsic high-dimensional state space of deformable objects. However, the reward function in reinforcement learning needs to measure the state configuration of the highly deformable object. Vision-based reward functions are difficult to implement, given the high dimensionality of the state and complex dynamic behavior. In this work, we propose the consideration of concepts beyond vision and incorporate other modalities which can be extracted from deformable objects. By integrating tactile sensor cells into a textile piece, proprioceptive capabilities are gained that are valuable as they provide a reward function to a reinforcement learning agent.

Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions.

The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations.

Recently, software‐defined network (SDN) methodologies have benefitted OT networks with enhanced situational awareness, centralized configuration, deny‐by-default forwarding rules, and increased performance. What makes SDNs so innovative is the separation between the control plane and the data plane, centralizing the command in the controllers. However, due to their young age, the use of SDNs in the industry context has not yet matured comprehensive SDN‐based architectures for IT/OT networks, which are also resistant to security attacks such as denial‐of‐service ones, which may occur in SDN‐based industrial IoT (IIoT) networks.

No consolidated security solutions are available that provide DoS detection and mitigation strategies in IT/OT networks. Along this direction, this paper’s contributions are twofold.

493123994,2021-01-11T00:00:00,"[EN] Internet of Things (IoT) is a new buzzword in information technology where real-world physical objects are made smart by integrating them with internet-enabled technologies. The things can sense information around them, communicate the sensed information over some protocol and employ the information to solve real-life problems. In IoT, several technologies are integrated under a common umbrella so that they can connect and exchange data over a network protocol. A huge amount of data is generated from diverse geographical locations with the consequent urge for fast aggregation of overall sensed information, leading to an increase in the need to store and process such data in a more efficient and effective manner. The traditional fields of embedded systems, WSN, real-time analytics, automation system, machine learning and others all contribute to enabling the IoT. This article is focused on discussing the various IoT technologies, protocols and their application and usage in our daily life. It also summarizes the current state-of-the-art IoT architecture in various spheres conventionally and all related terminologies that will give the forthcoming researchers a glimpse of IoT as a whole.Goel, SS.; Goel, A.; Kumar, M.; Moltó, G.

481453083,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"With the speeding up of the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) worldwide commercialization, one of the paramount questions for operators and vendors is how to optimize the radio links, considering the widely diverse scenarios envisioned. One of the key pillars of 5G has been an unprecedented flexibility on the configuration of the radio access network (RAN) on scenarios that include cellular, vehicular, and industrial networks among others. This flexibility has its main exponent on link adaptation (LA), which has evolved into a multi-domain technique where a plethora of parameters, like numerology, bandwidth part, radio frequency beam, power, modulation and coding scheme (MCS) or multiple antenna precoding can be adapted to the instantaneous link conditions. Although such enhancements open the door to a significant performance improvement, they also pose many challenges to LA optimization. In this article, we first present the signaling aspects of NR technology for multi-domain LA and the challenges that need to be faced. Then, we explore the latest advances on LA for wireless networks. We envision a combination of machine learning (ML) tools with multi-domain LA as a key enabler for 5G and beyond networks. Finally, we investigate emerging ML approaches for LA and present a promising application of ML for LA that is assessed with simulations. With this scheme, the training is performed at the network side to relieve the user equipment (UE) to do such a complex task. It is shown with simulations that our ML approach outperforms the well-known outer loop link adaptation (OLLA) algorithm in terms of instantaneous block error rate (BLER), while reaching the same average spectral efficiency (SE). Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed scheme only requires 4 bits to represent the features used to train the model, which makes it suitable for implementation in real systems with limited feedback",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Emerging Tools for Link Adaptation on 5G NR and Beyond: Challenges and Opportunities,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111783,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491014911,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Industry 4.0 has been a hot topic in recent years. The process of integrating Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, will become the trend in future construction of smart factories. In the past, smart factories were developed around the concept of the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). Most parts of the quality management process still needed to be implemented by Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) methods which required human resources and time to perform second stage testing. Screening standards also resulted in the elimination of about 30% of the products. In this study, we sort and analyze several Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and YOLO models that are currently more advanced and widely used, analyze the methods and development problems of the various models, and propose a suitable real-time image recognition model and architecture suitable for Integrated Circuit Board (ICB) in manufacturing process. The goal of the first stage of this study is to collect and use different types of ICBs as model training data sets, and establish a preliminary image recognition model that can classify and predict different types of ICBs based on different feature points. The second stage explores image augmentation fusion and optimization methods. The data augmentation method used in this study can reach an average accuracy of 96.53%. In the final stage, there is discussion of the applicability of the model to detect and recognize the ICB directionality in &lt;1 s with a 98% accuracy rate to meet the real-time requirements of smart manufacturing.

433806836,2021-04-30T00:00:00,"The object of research is the process of using information technology in the construction industry. One of the most problematic areas is increasing the efficiency of the construction industry through the introduction of digital technologies. The research carried out is based on the application of an approach that is implemented using artificial intelligence. The study used machine learning and fuzzy logic methods to mark visual data and analyze it for potential threats, as well as to reduce all possible risks. The main feature of this approach is that using machine learning technology, it is possible to reduce the risks of a project before they affect its profit. So, using artificial intelligence in combination with BIM technologies, it is possible to predict work on construction projects based on real-time data, past activities and other factors in such a way as to optimize construction processes. The benefits to be gained from implementing digital processes will become even more evident in future projects as AI continues to analyze company data. This is due to the fact that the proposed approach using fuzzy logic has a number of features, in particular, the more information machine learning algorithms process, the more complex they become. As a result, they provide even more useful information and allow to make even better decisions. This provides an opportunity to minimize risks and efficiently allocate resources when working on projects. Compared to conventional information technology, artificial intelligence can be used to build a knowledge-based security management system and combine statistical probabilities to help mitigate security risks in construction projects.Объектом исследования является процесс использования информационных технологий в строительной отрасли. Одним из самых проблемных мест является повышение эффективности работы строительной отрасли за счет внедрения цифровых технологий. Проведенные исследования базируются на применении подхода, который реализуется с помощью использования искусственного интеллекта. В ходе исследования использовались методы машинного обучения и нечеткой логики, позволяющие отмечать визуальные данные и анализировать их на предмет потенциальных угроз, а также для сокращения всех возможных рисков. Главная особенность данного подхода заключается в том, что с помощью технологии машинного обучения можно сокращать риски проекта до того, как они повлияют на его прибыль. Так, используя искусственный интеллект в сочетании с BIM-технологией, можно на основе данных в режиме реального времени, прошедшей деятельности и других факторов спрогнозировать работу над строительными проектами таким образом, чтобы оптимизировать строительные процессы. Преимущества, которые можно получить в результате внедрения цифровых процессов, будут еще более очевидными при работе над проектами в будущем по мере того, как искусственный интеллект продолжит анализировать данные компаний. Это связано с тем, что предложенный подход с использованием нечеткой логики имеет ряд особенностей, в частности, чем больше информации обрабатывают алгоритмы машинного обучения, тем сложнее они становятся. А в результате они предоставляют еще больше полезной информации и позволяют принимать еще более грамотные ришення. Благодаря этому обеспечивается возможность максимально снизить риски и эффективно распределить ресурсы при работе над проектами.

В ході дослідження використовувалися методи машинного навчання та нечіткої логіки, що дозволяють відзначати візуальні дані та аналізувати їх на предмет потенційних загроз, а також для скорочення всіх можливих ризиків. Головна особливість даного підходу полягає в тому, що за допомогою технології машинного навчання можна скорочувати ризики проєкту до того, як вони вплинуть на його прибуток. Так, використовуючи штучний інтелект у поєднанні з BIM-технологіями, можна на основі даних в режимі реального часу, минулої діяльності та інших факторів спрогнозувати роботу над будівельними проєктами таким чином, щоб оптимізувати будівельні процеси. Переваги, які можна отримати в результаті впровадження цифрових процесів, будуть ще більш очевидними при роботі над проєктами в майбутньому в міру того, як штучний інтелект продовжить аналізувати дані компаній. Це пов'язано з тим, що запропонований підхід з використанням нечіткої логіки має ряд особливостей, зокрема чим більше інформації обробляють алгоритми машинного навчання, тим складнішими вони стають. А в результаті вони надають ще більше корисної інформації та дозволяють приймати ще більш грамотні рішення. Завдяки цьому забезпечується можливість максимально знизити ризики та ефективно розподілити ресурси при роботі над проєктами.

Learn from the advantages and disadvantages of the thermodynamic model based and data-driven artificial intelligence based gas-path diagnosis methods, a newfangled gas turbine gas-path diagnosis approach on the basis of knowledge data-driven artificial intelligence is proposed. That is a hybrid method of deep learning and gas path analysis. First, gas turbine thermodynamic model of the object to be diagnosed is constructed by adaptation modeling strategy.

Secondly, a large number of knowledge data corresponding to component health parameters and gas turbine boundary condition parameters &#x0026; gas-path measurable parameters are simulated by setting different component health parameter values and different boundary conditions based on this basal model.

479297441,2021-07-01T00:00:00,"Inadequate management practices for solid waste and wastewater are some of the main causes of eutrophication globally, especially in regions where intensive livestock, agricultural, and industrial activities are coupled with inexistent or ineffective waste and wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study, a methodological approach is presented to spatially assess the trophic state of large territories based on public water quality databases. The trophic state index (TSI) includes total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll A, chemical oxygen demand, and Secchi disk depth values as water quality indicators. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatiotemporal attributes of the water quality data, in addition to spatially displaying the results of TSI calculations. As a case study, this methodological approach was applied to determine the critical regions for mitigating eutrophication in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Although a decreasing trend was observed for the TSI values over time for most subbasins (2012–2019), a tendency for extreme hypereutrophication was observed in some regions, such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area and the Altos region, which are of high economic relevance at the state level. A correlation analysis was performed between the TSI parameters and rainfall measurements for all subbasins under analysis, which suggested a tendency for nutrient wash-off during the rainy seasons for most subbasins; however, further research is needed to quantify the real impacts of rainfall by including other variables such as elevation and slope. The relationships between the water quality indicators and land cover were also explored. The GIS methodology proposed in this study can be used to spatially assess the trophic state of large regions over time, taking advantage of available water quality databases. This will enable the efficient development and implementation of public policies to assess and mitigate the eutrophication of water sources, as well as the efficient allocation of resources for critical regions.

This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of big data, problems of data collection, its reliability and use. Big data can be used for the analysis and modeling of phenomena relevant to public governance and social policy. Big data consist of three main types: a) historical data, b) present data with little delay, c) prognostic data for future forecasting. The following categories of big data can be defined as: a) data from social networks, b) traditional data from business systems, c) machine-generated data, such as water extraction, pollution, satellite information. The article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of big data. There are big data challenges such as data security, lack of cooperation in civil service and social work, in rare situations – data fragmentation, incompleteness and erroneous issues, as well as ethical issues regarding the analysis of data and its use in social policy and social administration.
Big data, covered by Artificial Intelligence, can be used in public governance and social policy by identifying “the hot spots” of various phenomena, by prognosing the meanings of variables in the future on the basis of past time rows, and by calculating the optimal motion of actions in the situations where there are possible various alternatives. The technologies of Artificial Intelligence are used more profoundly in many spheres of public policy, and in the governance of COVID-19 pandemics too.
The substantial advantages of the provided big data and Artificial Intelligence are a holistic improvement of public services, possibilities of personalization, the enhancement of citizen satisfaction, the diminishing of the costs of processing expenditure, the targeting of adopted and implemented decisions, more active involvement of citizens, the feedback of the preferences of policy formation and implementation, the observation of social phenomenas in real time, and possibilities for more detailed prognosing.
Challenges to security of data, necessary resources and competences, the lack of cooperation in public service, especially rare instances of data fragmentation, roughness, falseness, and ethical questions regarding data analysis and application can be evaluated as the most significant problems of using big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.
Big data and their analytics conducted using Artificial Intelligence technologies can contribute to the adequacy and objectivity of decisions in public governance and social policy, effectively curbing corruption and nepotism by raising the authority and confidence of public sector organizations in governance, which is so lacking in the modern world.Šiame tarpdisciplininiame straipsnyje pateikiama XXI amžiaus ketvirtosios pramonės revoliucijos fenomenų – didžiųjų duomenų ir dirbtinio intelekto technologijų – samprata ir aptariamos jų naudojimo viešojo valdymo srityje ir socialinėje politikoje galimybės, nagrinėjami didžiųjų duomenų pranašumai ir trūkumai, jų rinkimo, patikimumo ir naudojimo problemos.

Based on the construction of cloud fuzzy neural network model, the above method is used for experimental comparison analysis, and experiments are conducted through University of California Irvine (UCI) dataset and engineering examples to compare with the traditional cloud model, fuzzy neural network, and BP neural network to analyze the operation efficiency, accuracy rate, and several rules of the algorithm. Through the experimental comparative analysis, the cloud fuzzy neural network can fully take into account the randomness and fuzziness of the data, optimize the generation of cloud rules, avoid multidimensional rule disasters, and ensure the operational efficiency of the algorithm; the accuracy rate of the algorithm is improved relative to that of the traditional technology, and it applies to a variety of datasets. And the software is used to test the ice and snow tourism industry system dynamics model to realize the correctness and robustness testing of the model.

491009957,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"As machining processes are complex in nature due to the involvement of large plastic strains occurring at higher strain rates, and simultaneous thermal softening of material, it is necessary for manufacturers to have some manner of determining whether the inputs will achieve the desired outputs within the limitations of available resources. However, finite element simulations—the most common means to analyze and understand the machining of high-performance materials under various cutting conditions and environments—require high amounts of processing power and time in order to output reliable and accurate results which can lead to delays in the initiation of manufacture. The objective of this study is to reduce the time required prior to fabrication to determine how available inputs will affect the desired outputs and machining parameters. This study proposes a hybrid predictive methodology where finite element simulation data and machine learning are combined by feeding the time series output data generated by Finite Element Modeling to an Artificial Neural Network in order to acquire reliable predictions of optimal and/or expected machining inputs (depending on the application of the proposed approach) using what we describe as a backwards training model. The trained network was then fed a test dataset from the simulations, and the results acquired show a high degree of accuracy with regards to cutting force and depth of cut, whereas the predicted/expected feed rate was wildly inaccurate. This is believed to be due to either a limited dataset or the much stronger effect that cutting speed and depth of cut have on power, cutting forces, etc., as opposed to the feed rate. It shows great promise for further research to be performed for implementation in manufacturing facilities for the generation of optimal inputs or the real-time monitoring of input conditions to ensure machining conditions do not vary beyond the norm during the machining process",'MDPI AG',A Hybrid Finite Element—Machine Learning Backward Training Approach to Analyze the Optimal Machining Conditions,10.3390/ma14216717,,"[{'title': 'Materials', 'identifiers': ['issn:1996-1944', '1996-1944']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
493124263,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] This paper introduces an open-source platform to support serverless computing for scientific data-processing workflow-based applications across the Cloud continuum (i.e. simultaneously involving both on-premises and public Cloud platforms to process data captured at the edge). This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.The authors would like to thank the European Union for the project ""Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum"" (AI-SPRINT), with code 101016577, funded under the H2020 Framework Programme and also the regional government of the Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) for the project IDIFEDER/2018/032 (High-Performance Algorithms for the Modeling, Simulation and early Detection of diseases in Personalized Medicine), co-funded by the European Union ERDF funds (European Regional Development Fund) of the Comunitat Valenciana 2014-2020.Risco, S.; Moltó, G.; Naranjo-Delgado, DM.; Blanquer Espert, I.

This is essentially resulting fromincentives provided to distributed generation. Relevant changes in this domain are still occurring, such asthe extension of national and regional markets to continental scales. Decision support tools have therebybecome essential to help electricity market players in their negotiation process. This paper presentsa metalearner to support electricity market players in bidding definition. The proposed metalearneruses a dynamic artificial neural network to create its own output, taking advantage on several learningalgorithms already implemented in ALBidS (Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System). The proposedmetalearner considers different weights for each strategy, based on their individual performance. Themetalearner’s performance is analysed in scenarios based on real electricity markets data using MASCEM(Multi-Agent Simulator for Competitive Electricity Markets).

491186622,2022-02-07T11:18:21,"The need to scale software test automation while managing the test automation process within a reasonable time frame remains a crucial challenge for software development teams (DevOps). Unlike hardware, the software cannot wear out but can fail to satisfy the functional requirements it is supposed to meet due to the defects observed during system operation. In this era of big data, DevOps teams can deliver better and efficient code by utilizing machine learning (ML) to scan their new codes and identify test coverage gaps.

Selection of technologies to obtain the expected outcome should, obviously, be consistent with the criteria of sustainable development. There is a range of technologies being suggested for driving change in aquaculture to enhance its contribution to food security. It is necessary to highlight the complexity of issues for systems approach that can shape the course of development of aquaculture so that it can live-up to the expected fish demand by 2030 in addition to the current quantity of 82.1 million tons. Some of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) technologies suggested to achieve this target envisage the use of real- time monitoring, integration of a constant stream of data from connected production systems and intelligent automation in controls. This requires application of mobile devices, internet of things (IoT), smart sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, robotics as well as augmented virtual and mixed reality. AI is receiving more attention due to many reasons. Its use in aquaculture can happen in many ways, for example, in detecting and mitigating stress on the captive fish which is considered critical for the success of aquaculture. While the technology intensification in aquaculture holds a great potential but there are constraints in deploying IR4.0 tools in aquaculture.

491499897,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Wireless technologies play a key role in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario, for the development of increasingly flexible and interconnected factory systems. A significant opportunity in this context is represented by the advent of Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) wireless technologies, that enable a reliable, secure, and effective transmission of measurement data over long communication ranges and with very low power consumption. Nevertheless, reliability in harsh environments (as typically occurs in the industrial scenario) is a significant issue to deal with. Focusing on LoRaWAN, adaptive strategies can be profitably devised concerning the above tradeoff. To this aim, this paper proposes to exploit Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to design an adaptive LoRaWAN strategy for industrial applications. The RL is spreading in many fields since it allows the design of intelligent systems using a stochastic discrete-time system approach. The proposed technique has been implemented within a purposely designed simulator, allowing to draw a preliminary performance assessment in a real-world scenario. A high density of independent nodes per square km has been considered, showing a significant improvement (about 10%) of the overall reliability in terms of data extraction rate (DER) without compromising full compatibility with the standard specifications",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Adaptive LoRaWAN transmission exploiting reinforcement learning: The industrial case,10.1109/MetroInd4.0IoT51437.2021.9488498,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With innovative focus, the main constraint that will be addressed in this paper, and that usually is not considered, is the energy consumption cost in the production line. For that, an approach based on genetic algorithms is proposed and implemented. The use of local energy generation, especially from renewable sources, and the possibility of having multiple energy providers allow the user to manage its consumption according to energy prices and energy availability. The proposed solution takes into account the energy availability of renewable sources and energy prices to optimize the scheduling of a production line using a genetic algorithm with multiple constraints. The proposed algorithm also enables a production line to participate in demand response events by shifting its production, by using the flexibility of production lines. A case study using real production data that represents a textile industry is presented, where the tasks for six days are scheduled. During the week, a demand response event is launched, and the proposed algorithm shifts the consumption by changing task orders and machine usage.This work has received funding from Portugal 2020 under SPEAR project (NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-040224) and from FEDER Funds through COMPETE program and from National Funds through (FCT) under the project UIDB/00760/2020, and CEECIND/02887/2017.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",'MDPI AG',Production Line Optimization to Minimize Energy Cost and Participate in Demand Response Events,10.3390/en14020462,,"[{'title': 'Energies', 'identifiers': ['issn:1996-1073', '1996-1073']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An automatic solution for the approval prediction of enhancements could assist all the participants in resolving enhancements. The key challenges are the preprocessing of noisy textual information and the state-of-the-art feature models to combine the syntactical and semantic word information available in the given text. To this end, we propose a deep learning based approach for the approval prediction of enhancement reports that incorporates the users&#x2019; sentiments involved in the text. First, we preprocess the textual information of all enhancement reports to avoid noise. Second, we compute the sentiment of each enhancement report using Senti4SD. Third, we combine the bag-of-words (BOW) representation and traditional word2vec based representation to learn the novel deep representation (a recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention based representation) of preprocessed text. Using an attention mechanism enables the model to remember the context over a long sequence of words in an enhancement report. Fourth, based on sentiment and deep representation, we train a deep learning based classifier for the approval prediction of enhancement reports. Finally, we reuse the 40, 000 enhancement reports from 10 real software applications to evaluate the proposed approach. The cross-application evaluation suggests that the proposed approach is accurate and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

In this paper, the contribution of gesture recognition and pose estimation to the smooth introduction of cobots into an industrial assembly line is described, with a view to performing actions in parallel with the human operators and enabling interaction between them. The proposed active vision system uses two RGB-D cameras that record different points of view of gestures and poses of the operator, to build an external perception layer for the robot that facilitates spatiotemporal adaptation, in accordance with the human's behavior. The use-case of this work is concerned with LCD TV assembly of an appliance manufacturer, comprising of two parts. The first part of the above-mentioned operation is assigned to a robot, strengthening the assembly line. The second part is assigned to a human operator. Gesture recognition, pose estimation, physical interaction, and sonic notification, create a multimodal human-robot interaction system. Five experiments are performed, to test if gesture recognition and pose estimation can reduce the cycle time and range of motion of the operator, respectively. Physical interaction is achieved using the force sensor of the cobot. Pose estimation through a skeleton-tracking algorithm provides the cobot with human pose information and makes it spatially adjustable. Sonic notification is added for the case of unexpected incidents. A real-time gesture recognition module is implemented through a Deep Learning architecture consisting of Convolutional layers, trained in an egocentric view and reducing the cycle time of the routine by almost 20%. This constitutes an added value in this work, as it affords the potential of recognizing gestures independently of the anthropometric characteristics and the background. Common metrics derived from the literature are used for the evaluation of the proposed system.

In the food industry, in the packaging step, there are many products that are still evaluated by human operators. To automate the process and improve efficiency and effectiveness, computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques can be applied. This automation is challenging since specific strategies designed according to the application scenario are required. Focusing on the quality control of the sealing and closure of matrix-shaped thermoforming food packages, the aim of the article is to propose a deep-learning-based solution designed to automatically perform the quality control while satisfying production cadence and ensuring 100% inline inspection of the products. Particularly, the designed computer vision system and the image-based criteria defined to determine when a product has to be accepted or rejected are presented. In addition, the vision control software is described with special emphasis on the different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that have been considered (ResNet18, ResNet50, Vgg19 and DenseNet161, non-pre-trained and pre-trained on ImageNet) and on the specifically designed dataset. To test the solution, different experiments are carried out in the laboratory and also in a real scenario, concluding that the proposed CNN-based approach improves the efficiency and security of the quality control process. Optimal results are obtained with the pre-trained DenseNet161, achieving false positive rates that range from 0.03 to 0.30% and false negative rates that range from 0 to 0.07%, with a rejection rate between 0.64 and 5.09% of production, and being able to detect at least 99.93% of the sealing defects that occur in any production.

With the advancement of machine learning methods in resource-constrained environments, smart sensor systems have become increasingly powerful. As more data-driven approaches are deployed on the sensors, it is of growing importance to monitor data quality at all times of system operation. We introduce a smart capacitive sensor system with an embedded data quality monitoring algorithm to enhance the safety of human–robot interaction scenarios. The smart capacitive skin sensor is capable of detecting the distance and angle of objects nearby by utilizing consumer-grade sensor electronics. To further acknowledge the safety aspect of the sensor, a dedicated layer to monitor data quality in real-time is added to the embedded software of the sensor. Two learning algorithms are used to implement the sensor functionality: (1) a fully connected neural network to infer the position and angle of objects nearby and (2) a one-class SVM to account for the data quality assessment based on out-of-distribution detection. We show that the sensor performs well under normal operating conditions within a range of 200 mm and also detects abnormal operating conditions in terms of poor data quality successfully.

482691058,2021-11-11T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a relatively new concept that involves the merging of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT). It has emerged from the realization that Internet of Things networks could be further enhanced if they were also provided with Artificial Intelligence, enhancing the extraction of data and network operation. Prior to AIoT, the Internet of Things would consist of networks of sensors embedded in a physical environment, that collected data and sent them to a remote server. Upon reaching the server, a data analysis would be carried out which normally involved the application of a series of Artificial Intelligence techniques by experts. However, as Internet of Things networks expand in smart cities, this workflow makes optimal operation unfeasible. This is because the data that is captured by IoT is increasing in size continually. Sending such amounts of data to a remote server becomes costly, time-consuming and resource inefficient. Moreover, dependence on a central server means that a server failure, which would be imminent if overloaded with data, would lead to a halt in the operation of the smart service for which the IoT network had been deployed. Thus, decentralizing the operation becomes a crucial element of AIoT. This is done through the Edge Computing paradigm which takes the processing of data to the edge of the network. Artificial Intelligence is found at the edge of the network so that the data may be processed, filtered and analyzed there.  It is even possible to equip the edge of the network with the ability to make decisions through the implementation of AI techniques such as Machine Learning. The speed of decision making at the edge of the network means that many social, environmental, industrial and administrative processes may be optimized, as crucial decisions may be taken faster. 

Deep Intelligence is a tool that employs disruptive Artificial Intelligence techniques for data analysis i.e., classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to extract data from virtually any source type. This is a very important feature given the heterogeneity of the data being produced in the world today. Another very important characteristic is its intuitiveness and ability to operate almost autonomously.  The user is guided through the process which means that anyone can use it without any knowledge of the technical, technological and mathematical aspects of the processes performed by the platform. This means that the Deepint.net platform integrates functionalities that would normally take years to implement in any sector individually and that would normally require a group of experts in data analysis and related technologies [1-322]. 

The Deep Intelligence platform can be used to easily operate Edge Computing architectures and IoT networks. The joint characteristics of a well-designed Edge Computing platform (that is, one which brings computing resources to the edge of the network) and of the advanced Deepint.net platform deployed in a cloud environment, mean that high speed, real-time response, effective troubleshooting and management, as well as precise forecasting can be achieved. 

Moreover, the low cost of the solution, in combination with the availability of low-cost sensors, devices, Edge Computing hardware, means that deployment becomes a possibility for developing countries, where such solutions are needed most",,AIoT for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,,https://core.ac.uk/download/482691058.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we design a production throughput forecasting

system in an automated test operation in hard drive manufacturing plant. The proposed system

consists of three main stages. In the first stage, a mutual information method was adopted for

selecting the relevant inputs into the forecasting model. In the second stage, a generalized

regression neural network (GRNN) was implemented in the forecasting model development

phase. Finally, forecasting accuracy was improved by searching the optimal smoothing parameter

which selected from comparisons result among three optimization algorithms: particle swarm

optimization (PSO), unrestricted search optimization (USO) and interval halving optimization

(IHO).

Findings: The experimental result shows that (1) the developed production throughput

forecasting system using GRNN is able to provide forecasted results close to actual values, and to

projected the future trends of production throughput in an automated hard disk drive test  operation; (2) IHO algorithm performed as appropriate optimization method better than the

other two algorithms. (3) Compared with current forecasting system in manufacturing, the results

show that the proposed system’s performance is superior to the current system in prediction

accuracy and suitable for real-world application.

drive manufacturing systems that need to be forecast. The production throughput forecasting

result is useful information for management team to respond to any changes in production

processes and resources allocation. However, a practical forecasting system for production

147103496,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Energy Storage Systems will play crucial role in controlling the grid of the future when increased penetration of renewable energy sources will take place. Especially batteries are expected to occupy a considerable share of the total energy storage market by simultaneously providing services to different stakeholders such as energy producers, transmission/distribution operators, residential, commercial and industrial consumers. Nowadays, Peak shaving and Time-of-Use applications are the most common services that standalone battery storage systems can provide to industrial consumers (without integrated PV systems and/or wind turbines). A big part of the existing literature addressing such applications aims at developing an offline algorithm for optimal battery deployment based on a known load profile (or accurately predicted) without taking into consideration real time conditions. This paper investigates the impact of industrial load forecasting errors on dispatching strategies of battery storage systems on economically driven peak shaving and Time-of-Use applications. An artificial neural network has been developed and used as a prediction model of an industrial load profile. The neural network was trained, validated and tested on historical load data with time resolution of 15 minutes, provided by the local distribution operator of the Belgian electric grid. The performance of the neural network in terms of output-target regression and mean absolute error is 0.833 and 10.02% respectively. Afterwards, a simulation was carried out comparing four different scenarios of peak shaving. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the presented neural network is not competitive enough. Peak shaving based on
predicted profiles becomes reliable for lower forecasting errors. For this purpose, further access into the process and types of loads of the user is required in order to come up with a more sophisticated prediction model",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Assessing the impact of load forecasting accuracy on battery dispatching strategies with respect to Peak Shaving and Time-of-Use (TOU) applications for industrial consumers,10.1109/upec.2017.8231939,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389889861,2019-11-21T00:00:00,"The problem of inefficient processing in the Big Data industry is touched upon. A detailed analysis of the various means to increase the percentage of processed data is provided and the experimental implementation of a way to obtain and preprocess data in a mobile device network in real-time mode is shown.During the analysis of the subject, the next fields of research were observed: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Big Data, and GPGPU technology. The increasing numbers of publications, especially of papers that include mobile networks, were emphasized as evidence of rapid growth of the industry and a transition of neuron network algorithms toward mobile operating systems.Further analysis was focused on highlighting the most relevant and perspective objects for the research. The analysis showed that amidst currently most innovative and broadly widespread operation systems and frameworks to implement and engage neuron network algorithms Android operation system and TensorFlow framework has the most significant advantages.Due to the purpose of developing an experimental solution based on mobile device network and neuron network, different classes and types of neuron network architectures were explored. Two major types of mobile neuron networks such as quantized and integer neuron networks and the principal dissimilarity between them were described. Various neuron networks were tested on mobile devices with Internet connection via specially developed auxiliary software using GPGPU technology. Experimental results had shown that modern smartphones such as Huawei P20-Pro are capable to analyze, store and transmit the incoming from its camera sensor information at a rate of up to 40 frames per second. The usage of mobile GPU for improving the performance of the neuron networks was proved to be effective as such the number of frames processed by a neuron network per second can be elevated up to 10 times.The experimental software that task was to search for the given by user object in a real-time mode using mobile device network as both — server and processing nodes — proved to be a violable solution for the increasing amount of preprocessed up-to-the-minute information in the Big Data industry after the diligent research.As a summary, it needs to be stated that current progress in mobile device industry is making possible to bring neuron network technologies on mobile platforms and expand the capability of data aggregating services through the use of modern Deep Learning frameworks and GPGPU technology.Проаналізовано напрямки досліджень у галузі концептів Big Data, розподілених мереж мобільних пристроїв і Deep Learning.

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations. The latter can be used as maintenance directions by a human operator in charge of production monitoring and control",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"WHODID: Web-based interface for Human-assisted factory Operations in fault Detection, Identification and Diagnosis",10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_47,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
287429785,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of wireless sensor networks, which are the key ingredient in the growing Internet of Things (IoT), has surged over the past few years with a widening range of applications in the industry, healthcare, agriculture, with a special attention to monitoring and tracking, often tied with security issues. In some applications, sensors can be deployed in remote, large unpopulated areas, whereas in others, they serve to monitor confined busy spaces. In either case, clustering the sensor network’s nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network’s lifetime. In the present paper, we survey and compare popular and advanced clustering schemes and provide a detailed analysis of their performance as a function of scale, type of collected data or their heterogeneity, and noise level.

This increases the knowledge of what is happening in the soundscape, and this information encourages any monitoring system to take decisions depending on the measured events. Our research in this field includes, on one hand, smart city applications, which aim is to develop a low cost sensor network for real time noise mapping in the cities, and on the other hand, ambient assisted living applications through audio event recognition at home. This requires acoustic signal processing for event recognition, which is a challenging problem applying feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods. Furthermore, when the techniques come closer to implementation, a complete study of the most suitable platform is needed, taking into account computational complexity of the algorithms and commercial platforms price. In this work, the comparative study of several platforms serving to implement this sensing application is detailed. An FPGA platform is chosen as the optimum proposal considering the application requirements and taking into account time restrictions of the signal processing algorithms.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",,HAL CCSD,Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To optimize this activity, our main idea is to periodically select relevant measures to be executed (among a set of possible measures) and automatize their analysis by using a dedicated tool. The proposed solution is integrated in a whole PaaS platform called MEASURE. The tools supporting this activity are Software Metric Suggester tool that recommends metrics of interest according several software development constraints and based on artificial intelligence and MINT tool that correlates collected measurements and provides near real-time recommendations to software development stakeholders (i.e. DevOps team, project manager, human resources manager etc.) to improve the quality of the development process. To illustrate the efficiency of both tools, we created different scenarios on which both approaches are applied.

Traditionally, gaze tracking approaches to action recognition have relied upon computer vision-based analyses of two-dimensional egocentric camera videos. The objective of this study was to identify useful features that can be extracted from three-dimensional (3D) gaze behavior and used as inputs to machine learning algorithms for human action recognition. We investigated human gaze behavior and gaze-object interactions in 3D during the performance of a bimanual, instrumental activity of daily living: the preparation of a powdered drink. A marker-based motion capture system and binocular eye tracker were used to reconstruct 3D gaze vectors and their intersection with 3D point clouds of objects being manipulated. Statistical analyses of gaze fixation duration and saccade size suggested that some actions (pouring and stirring) may require more visual attention than other actions (reach, pick up, set down, and move). 3D gaze saliency maps, generated with high spatial resolution for six subtasks, appeared to encode action-relevant information. The ""gaze object sequence"" was used to capture information about the identity of objects in concert with the temporal sequence in which the objects were visually regarded. Dynamic time warping barycentric averaging was used to create a population-based set of characteristic gaze object sequences that accounted for intra- and inter-subject variability. The gaze object sequence was used to demonstrate the feasibility of a simple action recognition algorithm that utilized a dynamic time warping Euclidean distance metric. Averaged over the six subtasks, the action recognition algorithm yielded an accuracy of 96.4%, precision of 89.5%, and recall of 89.2%. This level of performance suggests that the gaze object sequence is a promising feature for action recognition whose impact could be enhanced through the use of sophisticated machine learning classifiers and algorithmic improvements for real-time implementation. Robots capable of robust, real-time recognition of human actions during manipulation tasks could be used to improve quality of life in the home and quality of work in industrial environments",,"eScholarship, University of California",Exploiting Three-Dimensional Gaze Tracking for Action Recognition During Bimanual Manipulation to Enhance Human-Robot Collaboration.,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

288551532,2019,"In proposing a machine learning approach for a flow shop scheduling problem with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking, this paper seeks to generate a tree-based priority rule in terms of a well-performing decision tree (DT) for dispatching jobs. Furthermore, generating a generic DT and RF that yields competitive results for instance scenarios that structurally differ from the training instances was another goal of our research. The proposed DT relies on high quality solutions, obtained using a constraint programming (CP) formulation. Novel aspects include a unified representation of job sequencing and machine assignment decisions, as well as the generation of random forests (RF) to counteract overfitting behaviour. To show the performance of the proposed approaches, different instance scenarios for two objectives (makespan and total tardiness minimisation) were implemented, based on randomised problem data. The background of this approach is a real-world physical system of an industrial partner that represents a typical shop floor for many production processes, such as furniture and window construction. The results of a comparison of the DT and RF approach with two priority dispatching rules, the original CP solutions and tight lower bounds retrieved from a strengthened mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation show that the proposed machine learning approach performs well in most instance sets for the makespan objective and in all sets for the total tardiness objective.© The Author(s) 201","[{'title': None, 'identifiers': [' 0171-6468', 'ISSN: 0171-6468']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',"A machine learning approach for flow shop scheduling problems with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking",10.1007/s00291-019-00567-8,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

295509361,2019-06,"In this study, we use unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with multispectral cameras to search for bodies in maritime rescue operations. A series of flights were performed in open‐water scenarios in the northwest of Spain, using a certified aquatic rescue dummy in dangerous areas and real people when the weather conditions allowed it. The multispectral images were aligned and used to train a convolutional neural network for body detection. An exhaustive evaluation was performed to assess the best combination of spectral channels for this task. Three approaches based on a MobileNet topology were evaluated, using (a) the full image, (b) a sliding window, and (c) a precise localization method. The first method classifies an input image as containing a body or not, the second uses a sliding window to yield a class for each subimage, and the third uses transposed convolutions returning a binary output in which the body pixels are marked. In all cases, the MobileNet architecture was modified by adding custom layers and preprocessing the input to align the multispectral camera channels. Evaluation shows that the proposed methods yield reliable results, obtaining the best classification performance when combining green, red‐edge, and near‐infrared channels. We conclude that the precise localization approach is the most suitable method, obtaining a similar accuracy as the sliding window but achieving a spatial localization close to 1 m.

However, Python lacks the computational performance that a industrial system requires for high frequency real time predictions.

Building upon a year long research project heavily based on SciKit Learn (sklearn), we faced performance issues in deploying to production. Replacing sklearn with a better performing framework would require re-evaluating and tuning hyperparameters from scratch. Instead we developed a python embedding in a C++ based server application that increased performance by up to 20x, achieving linear scalability up to a point of convergence.

322372256,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.Scopu",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier,10.1007/s11265-018-1378-3,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

144874233,2017-11-08,"This paper will describe and present results for a local flood risk reduction system which utilises existing in-network storage capacity to attenuate flow peaks. The storage capacity is mobilised through active flow control automatically regulated by an Artificial Intelligence system using local level monitoring.

The effects of climate change, population growth and urbanisation are putting increasing pressure on sewer and drainage networks both in the UK and overseas. The capacity of networks to cope with runoff at the required rate often falls short of requirements leading to localised floods and/or increased CSO spills to receiving waters. Smart Water/ Wastewater Network technologies have the potential to deliver improved service to customers and cost-effective performance improvements for the water industry.

CENTAUR aims to provide an innovative, cost effective, local autonomous data driven in-sewer flow control system whose operation will attenuate peaks and reduce the risk of surface water flooding. The system enables the capacity of existing infrastructure to be utilised more efficiently as a very economical alternative to capital-intensive solutions, for example building extra storage capacity. The system is also quick to implement with virtually no enabling works prior to installation.

CENTAUR comprises level monitors which relay data to an intelligent controller, which instructs a flow control device regulated by a novel and robust artificial intelligence routine based on Fuzzy Logic. The level monitors and intelligent controller are located locally and utilise real time data to provide effective real time control (RTC).

The CENTAUR Fuzzy Logic control algorithm was developed in Matlab. The Matlab RTC algorithm was linked to a SWMM hydro-dynamic model of a test network to prove its efficiency. Further rigorous testing was carried out by the University of Sheffield on the full-scale test facility designed to replicate field conditions. The CENTAUR system has been further developed and it is now implemented and fully functional in trial site in Coimbra, Portugal.

478671759,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed.

Recent developments in condition monitoring (CM) techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools enabled the collection of a huge amount of data in real-time and its transformation into meaningful information that will support the maintenance decision-making process. The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies connect distributed physical systems with their virtual representations in the cyber computational world. The PHM assumes a key role in the implementation of CPS in manufacturing contexts, since it allows to keep CPS and its machines in proper conditions. On the other hand, CPS-based PHM provide an efficient solution to maximize availability of machines and production systems.

This knowledge was used to develop a rapid and simple five-step assay to quantify Campylobacter, which was subsequently assessed for its specificity, reproducibility and accuracy in quantifying Campylobacter levels from processed chickens.

188688866,2018,"In the phase of industry digitalization, data are collected from many sensors and signal processing techniques play a crucial role. Data preprocessing is a fundamental step in the analysis of measurements, and a first step before applying machine learning. To reduce the influence of distortions from signals, selective digital filtering is applied to minimize or remove unwanted components. Standard software and hardware digital filtering algorithms introduce a delay, which has to be compensated for to avoid destroying signal associations. The delay from filtering becomes more crucial when the analysis involves measurements from multiple sensors, therefore in this paper we provide an overview and comparison of existing digital filtering methods with an application based on real-life marine examples. In addition, the design of special-purpose filters is a complex process and for preprocessing data from many sources, the application of digital filtering in the time domain can have a high numerical cost. For this reason we describe discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering as a tool for efficient sensor data preprocessing, which does not introduce a time delay and has low numerical cost. The discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering has a simpler implementation and does not require expert-level filter design knowledge, which is beneficial for practitioners from various disciplines.

286140236,2019-08-25T08:19:25,"Studying developers’ behavior in software development tasks is crucial for designing effective techniques and tools to support developers’ daily work. In modern software development, developers frequently use different applications including IDEs, Web Browsers, documentation software (such as Office Word, Excel, and PDF applications), and other tools to complete their tasks. This creates significant challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. Researchers usually instrument the software tools to log developers’ behavior for further studies. This is feasible for studies on development activities using specific software tools. However, instrumenting all software tools commonly used in real work settings is difficult and requires significant human effort. Furthermore, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. This abstraction is often performed manually or based on simple heuristics. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the above two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. First, we use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. ActivitySpace uses operating-system level instrumentation to track developer interactions with a wide range of applications in real work settings. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach to reduce the human effort to abstract low-level behavior data. Specifically, considering the sequential nature of the interaction data, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers’ low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To validate the generalizability of the proposed data collection approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner’s company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers’ one-week work in three actual software projects. The experiment with the collected data confirms that with initial human-labeled training data, the CRF model can be trained to infer development activities from low-level actions with reasonable accuracy within and across developers and software projects. This suggests that the machine learning approach is promising in reducing the human efforts required for behavior data analysis.This work was partially supported by NSFC Program (No. 61602403 and 61572426)","[{'title': 'Empirical Software Engineering', 'identifiers': ['issn:1382-3256', '1382-3256']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Inference of development activities from interaction with uninstrumented applications,10.1007/s10664-017-9547-8,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The images captured through a specially positioned camera are processed to identify the damaged, unusable potatoes, and a digital load cell is used to measure their weight. Subsequently, a deep learning architecture, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is utilised to determine a potential reason for the potato waste generation.

We were successful enough to achieve a training accuracy of 94.06%, a validation accuracy of 85%, and a test accuracy of 83.3% after parameter tuning.

Tests on real functional magnetic resonance image data show that, for some data distributions, our algorithm can obtain speed improvements by a factor of between 10 and 100, depending on the implementation. © 2019 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","[{'title': 'SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences', 'identifiers': ['1936-4954', 'issn:1936-4954']}]",'Society for Industrial & Applied Mathematics (SIAM)',"Efficient projection onto the ℓ ∞,1 mixed-norm ball using a newton root search method",10.1137/18M1212525,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
92690630,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Power grids are critical infrastructure assets that face non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft or faulty meters. NTL may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed in emerging countries. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly on-site inspections of customers. Electricity providers are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter's propensity to suggest a large number of unnecessary inspections. In this paper, we propose a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we propose a machine learning framework that classifies customers into NTL or non-NTL using a variety of features derived from the customers' consumption data. The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we propose a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram. Our approach allows domain experts to put the classification results into the context of the data and to incorporate their knowledge for making the final decisions of which customers to inspect. This work has resulted in appreciable results on a real-world data set of 3.6M customers. Our system is being deployed in a commercial NTL detection software",,,Identifying Irregular Power Usage by Turning Predictions into Holographic Spatial Visualizations,10.1109/icdmw.2017.40,https://core.ac.uk/download/92690630.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, this paradigm fails to meet the principles laid down by Industry 4.0 for real-time control towards Zero Defect Manufacturing for each individual product and intuitive technical assistance on the process parameters. In this paper, a Robust Software Platform oriented for a CPS-based Quality Assessment system for Welding is presented based on data derived from IR cameras. Imaging data are pre – processed in real-time and streamed into a module which utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to perform quality assessment. A database enables data archiving and post processing tasks along with an intuitive User Interface which provide visualization capabilities and Decision Support on the welding process parameters.

478373242,2019-07-16T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has wide range of applications in all areas and is gaining the understanding of the society as necessity instead of luxury. AI start ups are working to improve the quality of social interactions (social good), Education, Agriculture, manufacturing, health and medicine and public services. Hence the cost of not developing AI or developing it late is enormous. Despite the opportunities AI technologies may offer, there is a real risk that without thoughtful intervention it may in fact exacerbate structural, economic, social, and political imbalances, and further reinforce entrenched inequalities. For regulators and policymakers around the world, uneven access to technology remains a major concern because of its potential impacts on social and economic inequality. The author has conducted an exploratory research by reviewing related literatures on AI opportunities and challenges from experiences of the developed world and provided a discussion to identify the potential opportunities and expected challenges for AI adoption and implementation in Ethiopia. Finally the author has recommended what should be done.Keywords: Artificial, Intelligence,, Exploratory, Research, Skills, Infrastructure, Data, Privac",,'African Journals Online (AJOL)',Artificial intelligence for Ethiopia: opportunities and challenges,10.4314/ict.v16i1.,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395142912,2019-11-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls represent a major public health risk worldwide for the elderly people. A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elderly and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence, and life quality. In this sense, we propose IoTE-Fall system, an intelligent system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments that takes advantages of the Internet of Thing and the ensemble machine learning algorithm. IoTE-Fall system employs a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN wearable device capable of capturing in real time the data of the movements of elderly volunteers. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, in this paper, four machine learning algorithms (classifiers): decision trees, ensemble, logistic regression, and Deepnets are evaluated in terms of AUC ROC, training time and testing time. The acceleration readings are processed and analyzed at the edge of the network using an ensemble-based predictor model that is identified as the most suitable predictor for fall detection. The experiment results from collection data, interoperability services, data processing, data analysis, alert emergency service, and cloud services show that our system achieves accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity above 94%.Research presented in this article has been partially funded by Horizon 2020 European Project grant INTER-IoT no. 687283, ACTIVAGE project under grant agreement no. 732679, the Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Ecuador, and Secretaria de Educacion Superior Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT), Ecuador.Yacchirema, D.; Suárez De Puga, J.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

196184895,2019-02-19T00:00:00,"In the past, methods for hand sign recognition have been successfully tested in Human Robot Interaction (HRI) using traditional methodologies based on static image features and machine learning. However, the recognition of gestures in video sequences is a problem still open, because current detection methods achieve low scores when the background is undefined or in unstructured scenarios. Deep learning techniques are being applied to approach a solution for this problem in recent years. In this paper, we present a study in which we analyse the performance of a 3DCNN architecture for hand gesture recognition in an unstructured scenario. The system yields a score of 73% in both accuracy and F1. The aim of the work is the implementation of a system for commanding robots with gestures recorded by video in real scenarios.This work was funded by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness from the Spanish Government through the DPI2015-68087-R and the pre-doctoral grant BES-2016-078290, by the European Commission and FEDER funds through the project COMMANDIA (SOE2/P1/F0638), action supported by Interreg-V Sudoe",,'Scitepress',3DCNN Performance in Hand Gesture Recognition Applied to Robot Arm Interaction,10.5220/0007570208020806,https://core.ac.uk/download/196184895.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
343634975,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Measuring systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated in order to tackle the challenges of modern industrial problems. In particular, the Multiphase Flow Meter (MPFM) combines different sensors and data fusion techniques to estimate quantities that are difficult to be measured like the water or gas content of a multiphase flow, coming from an oil well. The evaluation of the flow composition is essential for the well productivity prediction and management, and for this reason, the quantification of the meter measurement quality is crucial. While instrument complexity is increasing, demands for confidence levels in the provided measures are becoming increasingly more common. In this work, we propose an Anomaly Detection approach, based on unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms, that enables the metrology system to detect outliers and to provide a statistical level of confidence in the measures. The proposed approach, called AD4MPFM (Anomaly Detection for Multiphase Flow Meters), is designed for embedded implementation and for multivariate time-series data streams. The approach is validated both on real and synthetic data",,'MDPI AG',Self-Diagnosis of Multiphase Flow Meters through Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection,10.3390/en13123136,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This is especially true in industrial sector. Machine Health Monitoring (MHM) was created. The primary goal of MHM is to ensure that all devices within an Industrial IoT (IIoT) implementation are functioning as expected at all times. For our specific usage of MHM, we are monitoring various readings from a 3D printer. We have currently implemented an array of sensors, and a live camera feed, with an accelerometer and a power meter soon to come. We have also created a web server running off of a Raspberry Pi 3 to hold our database and provide accessibility to the data. Through this setup, a user could access our storage and view up to the last 60 readings from the sensors in real time. The user can also view the live camera feed. We plan to use that range to implement fault detection with an alert system. We also look to eventually add predictive AI in an attempt to prevent faults before they occur. We believe our implementation provides a more cost-effective and scalable architecture for MHM. It also provides large amounts of customizability and adaptability due to our usage of generalized sensor data inputs and storage. The system is also self-monitoring, providing proper detection of its own internal issues",,Tennessee Tech University,Internet of Things (IoT) for Live Monitoring and Analysis of 3D Printers,,https://core.ac.uk/download/249321724.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
301258141,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"The discovery of a formal process model from event logs describing real process executions is a challenging problem that has been studied from several angles. Most of the contributions consider the extraction of a model as a one-class supervised learning problem where only a set of process instances is available. Moreover, the majority of techniques cannot generate complex models, a crucial feature in some areas like manufacturing. In this paper we present a fresh look at process discovery where undesired process behaviors can also be taken into account. This feature may be crucial for deriving process models which are less complex, fitting and precise, but also good on generalizing the right behavior underlying an event log. The technique is based on the theory of convex polyhedra and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and can be combined with other process discovery approach as a post processing step to further simplify complex models. We show in detail how to apply the proposed technique in combination with a recent method that uses numerical abstract domains. Experiments performed in a new prototype implementation show the effectiveness of the technique and the ability to be combined with other discovery techniques.Peer Reviewe","[{'title': 'Information Sciences', 'identifiers': ['issn:0020-0255', '0020-0255']}]",'Elsevier BV',Incorporating negative information to process discovery of complex systems,10.1016/j.ins.2017.09.027,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395677188,2020-07-17T00:00:00,"International audienceThe use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is still restricted to simulation or to enhance human-operated systems through recommendations. Real-world environments (e.g. industrial robots or power grids) are generally designed with safety constraints in mind implemented in the shape of valid actions masks or contingency controllers. For example, the range of motion and the angles of the motors of a robot can be limited to physical boundaries. Violating constraints thus results in rejected actions or entering in a safe mode driven by an external controller, making RL agents incapable of learning from their mistakes. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of a state-of-the-art deep RL algorithm (DQN), enabling learning from forbidden actions. To do so, the standard Q-learning update is enhanced with an extra safety loss inspired by structured classification. We empirically show that it reduces the number of hit constraints during the learning phase and accelerates convergence to near-optimal policies compared to using standard DQN.

Recent developments based on the concept of Industry 4.0 such as big data, new communication protocols and artificial intelligence provide several new avenues to explore. In the specific context of machining, we are working toward the development of a system capable of making the prognostic of the quality (in terms of dimensional conformance) of a workpiece in real time while it is being manufactured. The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms. In the end, this paper depicts the system architecture as well as its interactions between the multiple systems and software already in place at our industrial partner. This paper also shows preliminary results describing the relationship between the workpiece quality (in terms of respect toward the dimensional requirements) and the extracted features from the sensors signals. We conclude that it is now possible to do the diagnostic of a cutting operation. Additionally, with the same information we show that it is possible to quickly do the general diagnostic of the health state of the machine.

Injection moulding is a very complex process with several parameters having interactive
effects on each otherhence, computer-aided engineering and artificial intelligence were
utilised to optimise mould design based on weld line. Therefore, the finite element
analysis, artificial neural network and genetic algorithm were linked to find optimum gate
location in a plastic product. A reliable numerical model was developed by Moldflow
software based on a real product to simulate injection process. Moldflow was used to
predict weld line length and position of the part. Weld lines are visually undesirable and
a plastic part is structurally weak at weld line positions. This study describes how the
weld line was formed on the part. Polyamide-6 (PA-66) was used as the plastic material.
To find optimum gate location, the finite element predictions were implemented to train
a neural network, which was used later in the genetic algorithm. The optimisation
objective was to find gate location which led to minimum weld line length. This research
concluded that the developed procedure can efficiently optimise complex manufacturing

Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: "" is there a fault? "" , "" where did it happen? "" , "" for what reason? "". The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations.

For instance, control applications at the lowest level are susceptible to delays and errors while data analysis with machine learning procedures requires to move a large amount of data without real-time constraints. Standard data formats, like Automation Markup Language (AML), have been established to document factory environment, machine placement and network deployment, however, no automatic technique is currently available in the context of Industry 4.0 to choose the best mix of network architectures according to spacial constraints, cost, and performance.

This paper addresses a binary classification problem found in manufacturing engineering, which focuses on how to ensure product quality delivery and at the same time to reduce production costs. The aim behind this problem is to predict the number of faulty products, which in this case is extremely low. As a result of this characteristic, the problem is reduced to an imbalanced binary classification problem. The authors contribute to imbalanced classification research in three important ways. First, the industrial application coming from the electronic manufacturing industry is presented in detail, along with its data and modelling challenges. Second, a modified cost-sensitive classification strategy based on a combination of Voronoi diagrams and genetic algorithm is applied to tackle this problem and is compared to several base classifiers.

In addition, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) ranked the most common bacteria identified during trials in a DWDS according to their relative abundance while managing vagueness affecting the measurements.

In this paper we investigate the use of deep neural networks for performing automatic quality inspections based on image processing, with the aim of eliminating today’s manual inspection processes. A deep neural network is implemented on a real-world industrial case study and its performance is evaluated and analyzed when it comes to detecting quality problems in produced products. The results show that the network has an accuracy of 94.5% which is considered good in comparison to the 70-80% accuracy that a trained human inspector can achieve.CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</p",,'Elsevier BV',Image Processing based on Deep Neural Networks for Detecting Quality Problems in Paper Bag Production,10.1016/j.procir.2020.04.158,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
148807974,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"A real-time visual servo tracking system for an industrial robot has been implemented using PSD (Position Sensitive Detector) cameras, neural networks, and an extended trapezoidal motion planning method. PSD and directly transduces the light&apos;s projected position on its sensor plane into an analog current and lends itself to fast real-time tracking. A neural network, after proper training, transforms the PSD sensor reading into a 3D position of the target, which is then input to an extended trapezoidal motion planning algorithm. This algorithm implements a continuous motion update strategy in response to an ever-changing sensor information from the moving target, while greatly reducing the tracking delay. This planning method is found to be very useful for sensor-based control such as moving target tracking or weld-seam tracking in which the robot needs to change its motion in real time in response to incoming sensor information. Further, for real-time usage of the neural net, a new architecture called LANN (Locally Activated Neural Network) has been developed based on the concept of CMAC input partitioning and local learning. Experimental evidence shows that an industrial robot can smoothly track a moving target of unknown motion with speeds of up to 1 m/s and with oscillation frequency up to 5 Hz.X1113sciescopu","[{'title': 'Applied Intelligence', 'identifiers': ['issn:0924-669X', '0924-669x']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Real-time dynamic visual tracking using PSD sensors and extended trapezoidal motion planning,10.1023/A:1008385515068,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
427136958,,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a prevalent technology in the IT industry. One of the industries that can benefit extensively in this technology is healthcare. However, the healthcare IoT is still under debate with several studies suggesting it is lack of interoperability, security, and too much complexity. Even more, the risk involved in deploying it is still enormous. Many traditional risk assessment models are unable to provide a specific IoT risk guideline and specification, especially in the healthcare area. Thus, it is essential to understand the full extent of the IoT risk and how to manage its risk in the healthcare area. The risk management models, such as NIST SP 800-30, ISO/IEC 27005, OCTAVE, CRAMM, and EBIOS, which are among the leading and widely used in many areas and healthcare fields, have also been described. Besides, this paper includes a review of three IoT risk assessment models that are based on ABA-IDS, Deep Learning, and AHP-SVM. Based on the review analysis, we proposed a new enhanced healthcare IoT risk assessment model, which aims to provide a real-time monitoring and mitigating risks that incorporate the NIST SP 800-30 framework, ABA-IDS, and CNN deep learning. This shall constitute a better classification of each risk identified to find the best risk mitigation plan",,"International Journal of Innovative Computing, Penerbit UTM Press",A Conceptual Model for Internet of Things Risk Assessment in Healthcare Domain with Deep Learning Approach,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
304117829,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Deep Learning is increasingly being adopted by industry for computer vision applications running on embedded devices. While Convolutional Neural Networks' accuracy has achieved a mature and remarkable state, inference latency and throughput are a major concern especially when targeting low-cost and low-power embedded platforms. CNNs' inference latency may become a bottleneck for Deep Learning adoption by industry, as it is a crucial specification for many real-time processes. Furthermore, deployment of CNNs across heterogeneous platforms presents major compatibility issues due to vendor-specific technology and acceleration libraries.In this work, we present QS-DNN, a fully automatic search based on Reinforcement Learning which, combined with an inference engine optimizer, efficiently explores through the design space and empirically finds the optimal combinations of libraries and primitives to speed up the inference of CNNs on heterogeneous embedded devices. We show that, an optimized combination can achieve 45x speedup in inference latency on CPU compared to a dependency-free baseline and 2x on average on GPGPU compared to the best vendor library. Further, we demonstrate that, the quality of results and time ""to-solution"" is much better than with Random Search and achieves up to 15x better results for a short-time search",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Learning to infer: RL-based search for DNN primitive selection on Heterogeneous Embedded Systems,10.23919/DATE.2019.8714959,https://core.ac.uk/download/304117829.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237690220,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) there is a growing interest in the use of the Building Information Modelling (BIM). Through integration of information and processes in a digital model, BIM can optimise resources along the lifecycle of a physical asset. Despite the potential savings are much higher in the operational phase, BIM is nowadays mostly used in design and construction stages and there are still many barriers hindering its implementation in Facility Management (FM). Its scarce integration with live data, i.e. data that changes at high frequency, can be considered one of its major limitations in FM. The aim of this research is to overcome this limit and prove that buildings or infrastructures operations can benefit from a digital model updated with live data. The scope of the research concerns the optimisation of FM operations. The optimisation of operations can be further enhanced by the use of maintenance smart contracts allowing a better integration between users’ behaviour and maintenance implementation. In this case study research, the Image Recognition (ImR), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been used to detect users’ movements in an office building, providing real time occupancy data. This data has been stored in a BIM model, employed as single reliable source of information for FM. This integration can enhance maintenance management contracts if the BIM model is coupled with a smart contract. Far from being a comprehensive case study, this research demonstrates how the transition from BIM to the Asset Information Model (AIM) and, finally, to the Digital Twin (i.e. a near-real-time digital clone of a physical asset, of its conditions and processes) is desirable because of the outstanding benefits that have already been measured in other industrial sectors by applying the principles of Industry 4.0",,'WITPRESS LTD.',Office building occupancy monitoring through image recognition sensors,10.2495/SAFE-V9-N4-371-380,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
185552812,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper deals with the design of an intelligent self-configuring control scheme for robot manipulators. The scheme features two control structures: one of centralized type, implementing the inverse dynamics approach, the other of decentralized type. In both control structures, the controller is based on Integral Sliding Mode (ISM), so that matched disturbances and uncertain terms, due to unmodeled dynamics or couplings effects, are suitably compensated. The use of the ISM control also enables the exploitation of its capability of acting as a “perturbation estimator” which, in the considered case, allows us to design a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based decision making mechanism. It implements a switching rule, based on an appropriate reward function, in order to choose one of the two control structures present in the scheme, depending on the requested robot performances. The proposed scheme can accommodate a variety of velocity and acceleration requirements, in contrast with the genuine decentralized or centralized control structures taken individually. The assessment of our proposal has been carried out relying on a model of the industrial robot manipulator COMAU SMART3-S2, identified on the basis of real data and with realistic sensor noise",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Self-Configuring Integral Sliding Mode Control Scheme for Robot Manipulators,10.1109/CDC.2018.8619843,https://core.ac.uk/download/185552812.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275634114,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay communications networks have emerged as a new paradigm for implementing distributed services in microgrids due to their potential benefits: they are robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, and they can route messages even with a large number of nodes which are frequently entering or leaving from the network. However, current P2P systems have been mainly developed for file sharing or cycle sharing applications where the processes of searching and managing resources are not optimized. Locality algorithms have gained a lot of attention due to their potential to provide an optimized path to groups with similar interests for routing messages in order to get better network performance. This paper develops a fully functional decentralized communication architecture with a new P2P locality algorithm and a specific protocol for monitoring and control of microgrids. Experimental results show that the proposed locality algorithm reduces the number of lookup messages and the lookup delay time. Moreover, the proposed communication architecture heavily depends of the lookup used algorithm as well as the placement of the communication layers within the architecture. Experimental results will show that the proposed techniques meet the network requirements of smart microgrids even with a large number of nodes on stream.This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant ENE2015-64087-C2-2R.

479018889,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Accurate building energy prediction is vital to develop optimal control strategies to enhance building energy efficiency and energy flexibility. In recent years, the data-driven approach based on machine learning algorithms has been widely adopted for building energy prediction due to the availability of massive data in building automation systems (BASs), which automatically collect and store real-time building operational data. For new buildings and most existing buildings without installing advanced BASs, there is a lack of sufficient data to train data-driven predictive models. Transfer learning is a promising method to develop accurate and reliable data-driven building energy prediction models with limited training data by taking advantage of the rich data/knowledge obtained from other buildings. Few studies focused on the influences of source building datasets, pre-training data volume, and training data volume on the performance of the transfer learning method. The present study aims to develop a transfer learning-based ANN model for one-hour ahead building energy prediction to fill this research gap. Around 400 non-residential buildings’ data from the open-source Building Genome Project are used to test the proposed method. Extensive analysis demonstrates that transfer learning can effectively improve the accuracy of BPNN-based building energy models for information-poor buildings with very limited training data.

The EEG signal might have an artifact that has been analyzed and converted the observation into the mathematical library and repository software (HPC).

265120533,2019-12-13,"International audienceThe use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is still restricted to simulation or to enhance human-operated systems through recommendations. Real-world environments (e.g. industrial robots or power grids) are generally designed with safety constraints in mind implemented in the shape of valid actions masks or contingency controllers. For example, the range of motion and the angles of the motors of a robot can be limited to physical boundaries. Violating constraints thus results in rejected actions or entering in a safe mode driven by an external controller, making RL agents incapable of learning from their mistakes. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of a state-of-the-art deep RL algorithm (DQN), enabling learning from forbidden actions. To do so, the standard Q-learning update is enhanced with an extra safety loss inspired by structured classification. We empirically show that it reduces the number of hit constraints during the learning phase and accelerates convergence to near-optimal policies compared to using standard DQN.

Internet of Things security is attracting a growing attention from both academic and industry communities. Indeed, IoT devices are prone to various security attacks varying from Denial of Service (DoS) to network intrusion and data leakage. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) based security framework that automatically copes with the expanding security aspects related to IoT domain. This framework leverages both Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enablers for mitigating different threats. This AI framework combines monitoring agent and AI-based reaction agent that use ML-Models divided into network patterns analysis, along with anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT systems. The framework exploits the supervised learning, distributed data mining system and neural network for achieving its goals. Experiments results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme. In particular, the distribution of the attacks using the data mining approach is highly successful in detecting the attacks with high performance and low cost. Regarding our anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for IoT, we have evaluated the experiment in a real Smart building scenario using one-class SVM. The detection accuracy of anomalies achieved 99.71%.

The purpose of this system is the execution of wire insertion on commercial electromechanical components. The synergy between computer vision and tactile sensing is necessary because, in a real environment, the tight spaces very often prevent the possibility to use the vision system, also when the same task is performed by a human being. A novel technique to speed up the generation of training data sets for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Therefore, this technique is used to train a CNN in order to detect small objects (such as wire terminals). Moreover, aiming to prevent faults during the task and to interact with the environment safely, several machine learning approaches are used to produce an affordable output from the tactile sensor. The proposed approach shows how a cheap sensor embedded with suitable intelligence can provide information comparable to a more expensive force sensor. Note to Practitioners - This paper was motivated by the lack of commercial solution for the automatic cabling of switchgears. Existing approaches to this problem are in some way limited to specific large-scale products or simple layouts. This paper investigated a robust and flexible solution, based on the exploitation of multiple sensors and machine learning algorithms, for wire detection, grasping, and connection. The proposed approach is characterized by simple design and self-tuning capabilities, and it can be easily employed on a wide range of switchgear layouts thanks to the large workspace of the manipulator. Experimental results show that the proposed system is able to achieve a 95% success rate within a realistic admissible region.

We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge. As proven by previous hardware emulation tools, there is also a potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine early in the development cycle. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by predictive software running on a desktop computer. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL Safety Critical API. First, we create nonparametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames per second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated. To validate our models, we render an industrial scene with characteristic combinations not used during the training phase and we compare the predictions to those real values. We find a median prediction error of less than 4 FPS","[{'title': 'Scientific Programming', 'identifiers': ['1058-9244', 'issn:1058-9244', '1875-919x', 'issn:1875-919X']}]",'Hindawi Limited',Avionics Graphics Hardware Performance Prediction with Machine Learning,10.1155/2019/9195845,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

investigating the attributes usually referred to the characteristics of wheat flour known to consumers

and at implementing a predictive model of purchasing that allows to make correct decisions without

the necessary experience of a real human expert.

Design methodology: In order to investigate the research aims of the paper, an on-line survey was

Most of the contributions consider the extraction of a model as a one-class supervised learning problem where only a set of process instances is available. Moreover, the majority of techniques cannot generate complex models, a crucial feature in some areas like manufacturing. In this paper we present a fresh look at process discovery where undesired process behaviors can also be taken into account. This feature may be crucial for deriving process models which are
less complex, fitting and precise, but also good on generalizing the right behavior underlying an event log. The technique is based on the theory of convex polyhedra and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and can be combined with other process discovery approach as a post processing step to further simplify complex models.

395142972,2019-08-11T00:00:00,"[EN] Modelling the dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles, such as buses or trucks, can be very useful for driving simulation and training, autonomous driving, crash analysis, etc. However, dynamic modelling of a vehicle is a difficult task because there are many subsystems and signals that affect its behaviour. In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

200772417,2019-06-01T00:00:00,"In this study, we use unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with multispectral cameras to search for bodies in maritime rescue operations. A series of flights were performed in open‐water scenarios in the northwest of Spain, using a certified aquatic rescue dummy in dangerous areas and real people when the weather conditions allowed it. The multispectral images were aligned and used to train a convolutional neural network for body detection. An exhaustive evaluation was performed to assess the best combination of spectral channels for this task. Three approaches based on a MobileNet topology were evaluated, using (a) the full image, (b) a sliding window, and (c) a precise localization method. The first method classifies an input image as containing a body or not, the second uses a sliding window to yield a class for each subimage, and the third uses transposed convolutions returning a binary output in which the body pixels are marked. In all cases, the MobileNet architecture was modified by adding custom layers and preprocessing the input to align the multispectral camera channels. Evaluation shows that the proposed methods yield reliable results, obtaining the best classification performance when combining green, red‐edge, and near‐infrared channels. We conclude that the precise localization approach is the most suitable method, obtaining a similar accuracy as the sliding window but achieving a spatial localization close to 1 m. The presented system is about to be implemented for real maritime rescue operations carried out by Babcock Mission Critical Services Spain.This study was performed in collaboration with BabcockMCS Spain and funded by the Galicia Region Government through the Civil UAVs Initiative program, the Spanish Government’s Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness through the RTC‐2014‐1863‐8 and INAER4‐14Y (IDI‐20141234) projects, and the grant number 730897 under the HPC‐EUROPA3 project supported by Horizon 2020",,'Wiley',Detection of bodies in maritime rescue operations using unmanned aerial vehicles with multispectral cameras,10.1002/rob.21849,https://core.ac.uk/download/200772417.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Woody biomass Moisture Content (MC) is a key parameter for controlling the biofuel product qualities and properties. In this paper, we are interested in predicting MC from data. The input impedance of half-wave dipole antenna when buried in the wood pile varies according to the permittivity of wood. Hence, the measurement of reflection coefficient, that gives information about the input impedance, depends directly on the MC of wood. The relationship between the reflection coefficient measurements and the MC is studied. Based upon this relationship, MC predictive models that use machine learning techniques and feature selection methods are proposed. Numerical experiments using real world data show the relevance of the proposed approach that requires a limited computational power.

IIoT brings bulky use-cases with a simple goal of enabling automation, autonomation or just plain digitalization of industrial processes. The abundance of interconnected IoT and CPS generate additional burden on the telecommunication networks, imposing number of challenges to satisfy the key performance requirements. In particular, the QoS metrics related to real-time data exchange for critical machine-to-machine type communication. This paper analyzes a real-world example of IIoT from a QoS perspective, such as remotely operated underground mining vehicle. As part of the performance evaluation, a software tool is developed for estimating the absolute, one-way delay in end-toend transmissions. The measured metric is passed to a machine learning model for one-way delay prediction based on LTE RAN measurements using a commercially available cutting-edge software tool.

288328958,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"The industry is moving towards maintenance strategies that consider component health, which require extensive collection and analysis of data. Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration.publishedVersio",,,Simulation-driven Deep Classification of Bearing Faults from Raw Vibration Data,,https://core.ac.uk/download/288328958.pdf,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Particularly, four diverse machine learning approaches are implemented: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, and soft computing methods. We evaluate if there is one approach that outperforms the others when predicting the reliability of all the components, analyze if machine learning models improve their performance in the presence of censored data, and finally, understand the performance impact when the number of available inputs changes. Our experimental results show the high ability of machine learning to predict the component reliability and particularly, random forest, which generally obtains high accuracy and the best results for all the cases.

AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions.

The yeast viability, ethanol production, apparent extract and real degree of fermentation were monitored. The results obtained demonstrate that very high gravity worts at 22°P can be fermented in the same period of time as a 15°P wort, by raising the temperature to 18°C, the oxygen level to about 22 ppm, and increasing the pitching rate to 22 × 106 cell/mL. When diluting to obtain an 11.5°P beer extract, the volumetric brewing capacity increased 91% for the 22°P wort fermentation and 30% using the 15°P wort.

The purpose of this study was to establish a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the quantification of PCV-2 and to enable the rapid differentiation of porcine circoviruses type 1 and 2 (PCV-1 and PCV-2). Such a method would significantly speed up the process of clinical diagnosis, and could also be used to study the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases associated with PCV-2.MethodsMultiplex real-time PCR, together with LightCycler PCR data analysis software, was used for the quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2. A 263-bp DNA fragment was amplified from the 3′ end of the open reading frame-2 of PCV-2 by nested PCR, and its DNA sequence was verified as having 100% identity with a PCV-2 standard (NCBI accession number: AF055394). The 263-bp DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector, and the recombinant plasmid was serially diluted and quantified using real-time PCR. A standard curve was then constructed for quantification of the PCV-2 levels in field samples. The differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2 was carried out by analyzing the melting temperatures of the genotype-specific PCR products.ResultsTo quantify the PCV-2 levels in field samples, a standard curve (1 × 102 −1 × 109 copies/μL) was constructed. PCV-2 concentrations as low as 1 × 102 copies/mL could be detected in specimens taken from the lymph nodes or infected tissues in samples of PCV-2-infected pigs. The diagnosis of PCV-1 and PCV-2 infections and the quantification of the viral load in the field samples could be completed within 45 minutes after extracting the viral DNA using a commercial extraction kit.ConclusionThis study demonstrate that real-time PCR is a clinically feasible method for the accurate quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2",Taiwan Society of Microbiology.

Simulated data from the Cr 6+-Fe 2+ model derived are validated with online data and laboratory analysis using ICP-AES analysis method. The distinctive trend or patterns exhibited in the ORP profiles for the non-equilibrium model derived have been utilized to train neural network-based controllers for the process. The implementation of this process control is to ensure sufficient Fe 2+ solution is dosed into the wastewater sample in order to reduce all Cr 6+-Cr 3+. The neural network controller has been utilized to compare the capability of set-point tracking with a PID controller in this process. For this process neural network-based controller dosed in less Fe 2+ solution compared to the PID controller which hence reduces wastage of chemicals. Industrial Cr 6+ wastewater samples obtained from an electro-plating factory has also been tested on the pilot plant using the neural network-based controller to determine its effectiveness to control the reduction process for a real plant.

In many cases, such legacy code is written in a mainframe-specific assembly language and needs to be translated to a high-level language in order to be run on different architectures. Our research addresses this problem in a large-scale, real-life case study. We built an automatic tool, called Bogart, that translates IBM 370 assembly language programs to C. Bogart is based on Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques such as the Plan Calculus, translation by abstraction and re-implementation, program transformations, constraint propagation, and pattern recognition.Bogart was tested on real legacy code of a large commercial application: a database system and application generator, the main product of Sapiens International, Ltd. Bogart is compared with the literal brute-force translator initially developed by Sapiens, and is found to be superior on all counts, including portability of the resulting code, the amount of manual preparation required, and code size and speed. The results are shown for several small examples as well as a typical module consisting of several thousand lines of code from the Sapiens application. Bogart also seems to be more comprehensive than other reengineering systems reported in the literature. Bogart's analysis technology has recently been applied with significant commercial success to the analysis and remediation of Year 2000 bugs.This study demonstrates that certain AI techniques can be carefully combined to create industrial-strength applications that solve acute problems of Software Engineering. The fact that the research was carried out in industry on a real test case also revealed some of the problems of this approach. One example is the higher development cost of the AI approach, and the further effort that will be needed in order to extend it. (On the other hand, the literal translator has reached the end of its road, and cannot be enhanced at all.) Another problem we discovered is the difficulty of debugging the code produced by Bogart. The literal translator preserved the structure of the original program, whereas Bogart abstracted the code in various ways. As a result, the original assembly-language programmers found it harder to debug Bogart's code.

As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management.

The GCF scores the alternatives computing their expected utility and so, it requires a probability value associated to each possible final state. The estimated values of the criteria that characterize a state are bounded using fuzzy sets, which provide an easy method for assigning probability values.

55606136,2004-01-01T00:00:00,"A novel meso reactor based on oscillatory flow technology (Harvey et al., 2001) has been
recently presented in Harvey et al. (2003) as a new technology for reaction engineering and
particle suspension applications. Due to the demonstrated enhanced performances for fluid micro
mixing and suspension of catalyst beads and to the small volume of the reactor, this novel
miniature reactor is suitable for applications at specialist chemical manufacture and high
throughput screening. Furthermore, a high control of environment conditions (e.g. mixing
intensity, temperature) coupled with an online monitoring turns this reactor suitable for smallscale
applications to the bioengineering field, such as for fast parallel bioprocessing tasks.
This work concerns with the fluid dynamics characterisation of a novel miniature reactor.
Experimental results using state-of-art fibre-optic technology is used in order to demonstrate that
an accurate control of the residence time distribution (RTD) of liquid and solid phases can be
achieved within this reactor as well as enhanced (oxygen) mass transfer rates. Furthermore,
numerical simulations using Fluent ® software will be presented where simulated RTDs agrees
with the experimental results.
The meso reactor unit consists of 4.4 mm internal diameter and 35 cm long jacketed glass tubes,
with a unit volume of 4.5 ml and provided with smooth periodic constrictions (SPCs), with an
average baffle spacing of 13 mm. The internal diameter at the constricted zone (baffle internal
diameter) is 1.6 mm, leading to a reduction of the baffle free are of 87 %. This unit is able to
support batch or continuous operations mode, simply by configuring the tubes in parallel or in
series, according to the intended application. Mixing is achieved by oscillating the fluid at the
bottom or the top of the reactor by means of a piston pump, using oscillation amplitudes and
frequencies ranging from 0 to 4 mm centre-to-peak and 0 to 25 Hz, respectively.
Experimental studies using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique (Harvey et al., 2003)
showed that different fluid mechanics are originated at different oscillation conditions
(oscillation amplitudes and frequencies). A plug flow or a stirred tank behaviour can be obtained
just by controlling the oscillation conditions. At low oscillatory Reynolds numbers (Reo), e.g. 10
to 100, the formation of axisymmetric eddies detached from the constrictions is coupled with low
axial velocities and makes it possible to continuously operate the reactor in a plug flow mode.
Increasing the Reo to values higher than 100, the eddy symmetry is broken and a complete
mixing state is achieved inside the meso reactor. Low oscillation amplitudes must be used if
axial dispersion is intended to be minimized, namely at plug flow setup.
Through an overall oscillation cycle, changes of the location of the main flow stream from near
the wall to the centre of each cavity and vice-versa was observed and is expected to lead to high
mass and heat transfer rates (Perry, 2002). Due to the observed high radial velocities, narrow
residence times distributions are expected to be obtained (Perry, 2002). Also high axial
circulation rates were also observed at high Reos (above 100) and it was proved to lead to an
enhanced performance on catalyst beads suspension. The relation of this fluid mechanics with
the real performance of this novel meso reactor will be demonstrated.
Tracer injection technique is applied to perform RTD studies inside a single SPC tube of the
meso reactor. Spectroscopy UV/VIS technique is used to measure the concentration of a
coloured tracer at the inlet and outlet (at continuous mode) or at the bottom and the top of the
tube (at batch mode). A fibre optic apparatus is employed in order to obtain highly accurate
online measurements of the UV/VIS absorbance. Mixing times are calculated for experiments at
batch mode. Different flow rates are used to determine the effect of the flow rate over the RTD at
continuous operation and axial dispersion is presented by the Bodenstein number, Bo.
Determination of KL.a values is achieved by online measurement of the oxygen concentration
using a special fibre optic probe. The working tip of the probe was dip-coated with a ruthenium
complex immobilised in a sol-gel matrix. This complex is excited to fluorescence by a blue led
(470 nm outpuk peak) and the level of the fluorescence is inversely related to the concentration
of the oxygen through the Stern-Volmer equation (Wang et al., 1999), which is measured by the
fibre-optic apparatus. Retention of solid phases (e.g. catalyst beads and yeast cells) inside the
meso reactor will also be tested.
Further studies using the Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique will be presented where
accurate prediction of the distribution of residence times is achieved. The use of the distributionfunctions
permits to classify the flow behaviour inside this novel meso reactor patterns and to
calculate mixing efficiencies and axial dispersion coefficients (expressed by the Bo number) at
different oscillation conditions.
A simple 2-D axisymmetric laminar model showed good agreement with flow patterns
visualisations using PIV for Reo below 100 but a 3-D model with a very fine mesh was required
to simulate breakage of axisymmetry. Consequently, 3-D models based on laminar and Large
Eddy Simulations (LES) will be used to maximize the matching of RTD at higher oscillation
conditions. Main intended application of CFDs to this novel meso reactor is the design of a meso
reactor unit, which could operate at the best oscillation conditions and flow rate for cell cultures
and biocatalyst applications",,Residence times and mixing of a novel continuous oscillatory flow meso reactor,,https://core.ac.uk/download/55606136.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

203923069,2016-12-31,"AbstractTransferring predictive microbial models from research into real world food manufacturing or risk assessment applications is still a challenge for members of the food safety modelling community. Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed strategy, existing predictive models previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models are made publicly available in the first community Food Safety Model Repository called openFSMR (https://sites.google.com/site/openfsmr/).This work illustrates that a standardized information exchange format for predictive microbial models can be established by adoption of resources from Systems Biology. Harmonized description and annotation of predictive models will also contribute to increased transparency and quality of food safety models",The Author(s).

479759751,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"We describe the implementation and deployment of a software decision support tool for the maintenance planning of gas turbines. The tool is used to plan the maintenance for turbines manufactured and maintained by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB (SIT AB) with the goal to reduce the direct maintenance costs and the often very costly production losses during maintenance downtime. The optimization problem is formally defined, and we argue that feasibility in it is NP-complete. We outline a heuristic algorithm that can quickly solve the problem for practical purposes, and validate the approach on a real-world scenario based on an oil production facility. We also compare the performance of our algorithm with results from using mixed integer linear programming, and discuss the deployment of the application. The experimental results indicate that downtime reductions up to 65% can be achieved, compared to traditional preventive maintenance. In addition, using our tool is expected to improve availability with up to 1% and reduce the number of planned maintenance days with 12%. Compared to a mixed integer programming approach, our algorithm not optimal, but is orders of magnitude faster and produces results which are useful in practice. Our test results and SIT AB’s estimates based on operational use both indicate that significant savings can be achieved by using our software tool, compared to maintenance plans with fixed intervals.Proceedings of the Twenty-First Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI'09) published by IEEE Computer SocietyCam",IEEE Computer Society,A Tool for Gas Turbine Maintenance Scheduling,,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Agents provide suitable flexibility to give support to implied heterogeneity in cyber-physical systems. Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Control (QoC) parameters are commonly utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the communications and the control loop. Agents can use the quality measures to take a wide range of decisions, like suitable placement on the control node or to change the workload to save energy. This article describes the architecture of a multi agent system that provides support to QoS and QoC parameters to optimize de system. The architecture uses a Publish-Subscriber model, based on Data Distribution Service (DDS) to send the control messages. Due to the nature of the Publish-Subscribe model, the architecture is suitable to implement event-based control (EBC) systems. The architecture has been called FSACtrlThe architecture described in this article is a part of the coordinated project SIDIRELI: Distributed Systems with Limited Resources.

There is a lack of holistic methods in literature for capturing composite layup skills especially involving complex moulds. This research aims to develop an informatics-based method, enabled by consumer-grade gaming technology and machine learning, to capture and digitise manufacturing task knowledge from skill-intensive hand layup. The digitisation is underpinned by the proposed human-workpiece interaction theory and implemented to automatically extract and decode key knowledge constituents such as layup strategies, ply manipulation techniques, motion mechanics and problem-solving during hand layup, collectively categorised as layup skills.

60418644,2005-11-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, we present an automatic system and algorithms for the classification of marble slabs into different groups in real time in production line, according to slabs quality. The application of the system is aimed at the marble industry, in order to automate and improve the manual classification process of marble slabs carried out at present. The system consists of a mechatronic prototype, which houses all the required physical components for the acquisition of marble slabs images in suitable light conditions, and computational algorithms, which are used to analyze the color texture of the marble surfaces and classify them into their corresponding group. In order to evaluate the color representation influence on the image analysis, four color spaces have been tested: RGB, XYZ, YIQ, and K-L. After the texture analysis performed with the sum and difference histograms algorithm, a feature extraction process has been implemented with principal component analysis. Finally, a multilayer perceptron neural network trained with the backpropagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate is used to classify the marble slabs in three categories, according to their quality. The results (successful classification rate of 98.9%) show very high performance compared with the traditional (manual) system",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Automatic system for quality-based classification of marble textures,10.1109/TSMCC.2004.843236,https://core.ac.uk/download/60418644.pdf,"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics Part C (Applications and Reviews)', 'identifiers': ['1094-6977', 'issn:1094-6977']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275594362,2013-06-01T00:00:00,"Thanks to the built in intelligence (deployment of new intelligent devices and sensors in places where historically they were not present), the Smart Grid and Microgrid paradigms are able to take advantage from aggregated load forecasting, which opens the door for the implementation of new algorithms to seize this information for optimization and advanced planning. Therefore, accuracy in load forecasts will potentially have a big impact on key operation factors for the future Smart Grid/Microgrid-based energy network like user satisfaction and resource saving, and new methods to achieve an efficient prediction in future energy landscapes (very different from the centralized, big area networks studied so far). This paper proposes different improved models to forecast next day's aggregated load using artificial neural networks, taking into account the variables that are most relevant. In particular, seven models based on the multilayer perceptron will be proposed, progressively adding input variables after analyzing the influence of climate factors on aggregated load.

This is accomplished using a radial basis network neural with daughter Morlet wavelets activation functions in cascaded with an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. This scheme is applied in real time to control the speed of an AC three-phase induction motor supplied with a three-phase inverter. So in this way we show how the identification and control scheme can be implemented in this type of plants that are widely used in industry, without the need of mathematical model parameters of the induction motor. We present numerical simulation and experimental results.El autor O.

480277648,2012-10-01T00:00:00,"A compensation scheme to reduce the inherent baseband distortion in uniform PWM modulators (UPWM) is presented in this paper. The method is based on real-time mapping of the switching times of UPWM to those of natural PWM that, as it is well-known, exhibits far less in-band distortion. Two alternatives are presented: one based on an exact, analytic algorithm recently reported in the literature, and another one that uses an artificial neural network (ANN). Both methods are designed for arbitrary, band-limited modulating signals and they are not restricted to single-frequency sinusoids, as other techniques presented in the literature. Simulation results and experimental measurements of a FPGA implementation demonstrate a significant reduction of the distortion in real-time applications. The performance of both alternatives is compared for several modulating signals, and the results of industry-standard distortion tests are also reported. Finally, some guidelines for choosing the best alternative for ASIC or FPGA implementations are providedFil: Chierchie, Fernando. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

148523032,2012-01-01T00:00:00,"A number of new approaches to address the identification issues have been proposed recently, but due to the highly integrated nature of passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, it is difficult to evaluate them in real-world scenarios. A recurrent neural network-based hybrid approach with training through genetic algorithm has been proposed to model the performance of the RFID system with received power at the reader in the radio propagation channel as the implementable performance index. Target system is a conveyor system delivering multiple products. A method to deploy RFID technology has been developed and illustrated for smoothening flow on a conveyor. Although various analytical models have been proposed earlier, they fail to accurately predict the performance of RFID system. Proposed method incorporates various factors presented in the industrial environment, while only a few are considered in the analytical model. Such an integrated approach is a genuine extension of a previous model where only neural network model was tested to embrace the system's performance. A comparative study has been carried out to establish the better performance of proposed approach. The model proposed may be helpful to aid in the research area of simulation of RFIDs on computer for reflecting numerous factors in modelling for RFID system performance without sacrificing predictability.Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin",'Informa UK Limited',Monitoring the performance of conveyor system using radio frequency identification in manufacturing environment : a recurrent neural network and genetic algorithm-based approach,10.1080/0951192X.2011.646309,,"[{'title': 'International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing', 'identifiers': ['1362-3052', '0951-192x', 'issn:1362-3052', 'issn:0951-192X']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Concept of Automated Vehicle in the era of the fourth industrial revolution is transforming from the `vehicle` that had its focal point in the hardware to the `portable computer` that has its focus in the software that processes broad range of digital information. The phenomenon in one aspect is innovation through scientific technology. However on the other hand, it is raising humanistic, philosophical and legal questions about how human life will change according to the technological and industrial transition. Age of `Artificial Intelligence` and `Posthuman` emerging through the development of technology is creating new concept of human and bringing forward the issue of new danger that is occurring when reason and physical abilities thought as the essence of `human` is being substituted by scientific technology and computer. The advocates of automated vehicle assert that it provides more safety and convenience to human. Such argument cannot be completely be false, and I wish to reach the same conclusion eventually. However, as other process of introducing new technology like nuclear energy tell us, to consider whether automated vehicle is more convenient and better than the previous vehicle system and whether there are no new danger that new technology is bringing about or overlooked elements of danger is severely important. Therefore, if certain danger is expected, technological prevention should be devised as a first step, and for the sections where technology and industry is not self-regulating, it is legislations and policies` role to lead and force to a human-friendly direction. Automated vehicle that is being discussed nowadays can be neutral itself and seem to be no more than a convenient device. However, since each automated vehicle is activated by entering massive amount of digital information and since it collects, stores, and distributes a welter of personal information when connected to Internet of Things(IoT), whole new danger from the previous era is created in terms of personal information and privacy. The ironic reality of surveillance society since the modern times that has assured freedom of an individual on the one hand and has reinforced utilitarian society control on the grounds of fully protecting one`s right and expanding welfare on the other lies beneath this near future. Especially, personal information is more being exposed and distributed and collection and surveillance of digital information is becoming easier in the information age. Automated vehicle system cannot be free from such exposure and danger of violating since it is operated with geolocation, video, and communication information as well. Moreover, since violation of personal information can lead to violation of privacy and human dignity, and damage the basic order of liberal democracy, arranging the frame of public regulation relating to personal information protection by researching U.S. and European Union legislation and seems more than necessary. Being awake is what sovereign needs in the digital era. Likewise, to secure right to personal information, we should remember to turn the monitoring lamp on in advance not only as an individual, but also as a group in order to obtain convenience and prevent danger of new era of automated vehicle.��� ��������� ��������������� ������������������������������ ���������������(HY-2014������)",������������������������,Public Law Perspectives on Personal Information Protection in the Era of Automated Vehicle,,,"[{'title': 'Korean Journal of Law and Society', 'identifiers': ['1227-0954', 'issn:1227-0954']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

robotic devices (i.e. robots, cameras, etc.). It will enable the
student to learn in a collaborative manner (remote participation
with other students) where it will be possible to combine the onsite
activities (performed “in-situ” within the real lab during the
normal practical sessions), with the “on-line” one (performed
remotely from home via the Internet). Moreover, the remote
experiments within the E-Laboratory to control the real robots

82184962,1999-01-31,"AbstractMany organizations today are facing the problem of software migration: porting existing code to new architectures and operating systems. In many cases, such legacy code is written in a mainframe-specific assembly language and needs to be translated to a high-level language in order to be run on different architectures. Our research addresses this problem in a large-scale, real-life case study. We built an automatic tool, called Bogart, that translates IBM 370 assembly language programs to C. Bogart is based on Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques such as the Plan Calculus, translation by abstraction and re-implementation, program transformations, constraint propagation, and pattern recognition.Bogart was tested on real legacy code of a large commercial application: a database system and application generator, the main product of Sapiens International, Ltd. Bogart is compared with the literal brute-force translator initially developed by Sapiens, and is found to be superior on all counts, including portability of the resulting code, the amount of manual preparation required, and code size and speed. The results are shown for several small examples as well as a typical module consisting of several thousand lines of code from the Sapiens application. Bogart also seems to be more comprehensive than other reengineering systems reported in the literature. Bogart's analysis technology has recently been applied with significant commercial success to the analysis and remediation of Year 2000 bugs.This study demonstrates that certain AI techniques can be carefully combined to create industrial-strength applications that solve acute problems of Software Engineering. The fact that the research was carried out in industry on a real test case also revealed some of the problems of this approach. One example is the higher development cost of the AI approach, and the further effort that will be needed in order to extend it. (On the other hand, the literal translator has reached the end of its road, and cannot be enhanced at all.) Another problem we discovered is the difficulty of debugging the code produced by Bogart. The literal translator preserved the structure of the original program, whereas Bogart abstracted the code in various ways. As a result, the original assembly-language programmers found it harder to debug Bogart's code. This reaffirms the need for an explanation facility in intelligent applications",Published by Elsevier B.V.,Portability by automatic translation: A large-scale case study ,10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00101-5,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82184962.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of this study was to establish a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the quantification of PCV-2 and to enable the rapid differentiation of porcine circoviruses type 1 and 2 (PCV-1 and PCV-2). Such a method would significantly speed up the process of clinical diagnosis, and could also be used to study the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases associated with PCV-2.MethodsMultiplex real-time PCR, together with LightCycler PCR data analysis software, was used for the quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2. A 263-bp DNA fragment was amplified from the 3′ end of the open reading frame-2 of PCV-2 by nested PCR, and its DNA sequence was verified as having 100% identity with a PCV-2 standard (NCBI accession number: AF055394). The 263-bp DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector, and the recombinant plasmid was serially diluted and quantified using real-time PCR. A standard curve was then constructed for quantification of the PCV-2 levels in field samples. The differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2 was carried out by analyzing the melting temperatures of the genotype-specific PCR products.ResultsTo quantify the PCV-2 levels in field samples, a standard curve (1 × 102 −1 × 109 copies/μL) was constructed. PCV-2 concentrations as low as 1 × 102 copies/mL could be detected in specimens taken from the lymph nodes or infected tissues in samples of PCV-2-infected pigs. The diagnosis of PCV-1 and PCV-2 infections and the quantification of the viral load in the field samples could be completed within 45 minutes after extracting the viral DNA using a commercial extraction kit.ConclusionThis study demonstrate that real-time PCR is a clinically feasible method for the accurate quantification of PCV-2, and for the rapid differentiation of PCV-1 and PCV-2",Taiwan Society of Microbiology.

Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept.

Two different control approaches, based on classical and artificial intelligence techniques, were integrated within IPS and serve as practical examples of the structured approach to expert control. The IPS is a

refinement of the expert control architecture. It allows the integration of several control techniques in a single generic framework. Specifically, the paper presents the extensive experimental results derived from a micro-controller-based implementation of IPS on the real-time control of a typical industrial heat-exchanger process. The classical approach, based on auto-tuning techniques, was

implemented under the IPS framework. Three auto-tuning techniques, namely Ziegler–Nichols tuning, amplitude tuning and phase tuning were incorporated. In addition, neural-network-based control techniques using the modified cerebellar model articulation controller (MCMAC) were also seamlessly incorporated within the IPS scheme. The real-time experimental results using the IPS architecture significantly demonstrated the effectiveness of IPS in handling varying operating conditions.

352949308,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The process chain for the production of profiled strips, beams and panels includes a number of processes as mould design, fixing the number of cutting passes, tool grinding, tool measurement, moulding, sanding, profile-wrapping, coating and different types of quality assessment. This chain is still not consistently connected by means of information technologies. The design and the setup for each process in the chain are mostly done manually, using the experience of the operator. Computer aided systems (CAD/CAM) as widely used in the furniture industry are not in this field. The procedures are more complex and could not be automatized by the state of the art feature based algorithms. One attempt to solve the problem is the creation of a product data model that contains all information for the whole production process - not only geometrical data and tolerances but also semantic information (e.g. material, coating, batch size, etc.). Every process in the chain is now transforming the profile in a systematic and stochastic way. Both can be computed by the use of rules of artificial intelligence and tolerance calculations by means of statistical methods. Special CAM modules, which generate the specific process data, give also back the transformed profile and other necessary information to the superordinate product data model. The actual specific process data, for example for the process of profiling (e.g. setting parameters, pitch) can then be computed by a post processer using actual inputs as the geometry of the specified machine. The whole process chain can so be simulated before the real setup. The tools and processes can so be designed simultaneously in advance. The time for the production process can be reduced. This systematic is generating the same potentials as feature based CAD/CAM systems in the carcase furniture industry. The implementation of IT in the profiling process chain is accelerated and coordinated by the introduction of the linking product model",Luleå Univ. of Technology,A product data model and computer aided manufacturing for the process chain of profiling,,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence continue to be made in the wake of advanced information technology developments, and the field of intelligent evolutionary algorithms has attracted a particularly large amount of attention from researchers and users in the artificial intelligence community. The successful optimization of automation system design requires interdisciplinary integration, and further requires the use of actual cases, verification, and improvement to ensure implementation in real-world applications",'International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology',Applications of Intelligent Evolutionary Algorithms in Optimal Automation System Design,10.5875/ausmt.v1i1.100,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
81111337,2016-12-31,"AbstractTransferring predictive microbial models from research into real world food manufacturing or risk assessment applications is still a challenge for members of the food safety modelling community. Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed strategy, existing predictive models previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models are made publicly available in the first community Food Safety Model Repository called openFSMR (https://sites.google.com/site/openfsmr/).This work illustrates that a standardized information exchange format for predictive microbial models can be established by adoption of resources from Systems Biology. Harmonized description and annotation of predictive models will also contribute to increased transparency and quality of food safety models",'Elsevier BV',Towards Community Driven Food Safety Model Repositories ,10.1016/j.profoo.2016.02.098,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81111337.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
144707204,2016-03-23,"Electricity markets are becoming more competitive, to some extent due to the increasing number of players that have moved from other sectors to the power industry. This is essentially resulting from incentives provided to distributed generation. Relevant changes in this domain are still occurring, such as the extension of national and regional markets to continental scales. Decision support tools have thereby become essential to help electricity market players in their negotiation process. This paper presents a metalearner to support electricity market players in bidding definition. The proposed metalearner uses a dynamic artificial neural network to create its own output, taking advantage on several learning algorithms already implemented in ALBidS (Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System). The proposed metalearner considers different weights for each strategy, based on their individual performance. The metalearner's performance is analysed in scenarios based on real electricity markets data using MASCEM (Multi-Agent Simulator for Competitive Electricity Markets). Results show that the proposed metalearner is able to provide higher profits to market players when compared to other current methodologies and that results improve over time, as consequence of its learning process",,Metalearning to support competitive electricity market players' strategic bidding,10.1016/j.epsr.2016.03.012,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144707204.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The system helps the staff of the centers to solve customer problems by finding solutions successfully applied to similar problems experienced in the past. This improves the satisfaction of customers and ensures a good reputation for the company who manages the center and thus, it may increase its profits. The CBR system is portable, flexible and multi-domain. It is implemented as a module of a help-desk application to make the CBR system as independent as
possible of any change in the help-desk. Each phase of the reasoning cycle is implemented as a series of configurable plugins, making the CBR module easy to update and maintain.

211485892,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The twelve papers included in this special issue represent a selection of extended contributions presented at the Sixth International Conference on Soft Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications, held in Salamanca, Spain, 6–8th April, 2011. Papers were selected on the basis of fundamental ideas and concepts rather than the direct usage of well-established techniques. This special issue is then aimed at practitioners, researchers and post-graduate students, who are engaged in developing and applying advanced Soft Computing Models to solving real-world problems in the Industrial and Environmental fields. The papers are organized as follows. In the first contribution, Graña and Gonzalez-Acuña develop a formulation of dendritic classifiers based on lattice kernels and train them using a direct Monte Carlo approach and a Sparse Bayesian Learning. The results of both kinds of training are compared with the Relevance Vector Machines on a collection of benchmark datasets. In the second contribution by Irigoyen and Miñano, the authors present the results of the identification of the relationship in time, between the required exercise (machine resistance) and the heart rate of the patient in medical effort tests, using a NARX neural network model. In the experimental stage, test data have been obtained by exercising with a cyclo-ergometer in two different tests: Power Step Response and Conconi. Carneiro et al. in the third contribution present a biologically inspired method to deal with the problem in which genetic algorithms are used to create possible solutions for a given dispute. The approach presented is able to generate a broad number of diverse solutions that cover virtually the whole search space for a given problem. The results of this work are being applied in a negotiation tool that is part of the UMCourt conflict resolution platform. In the fourth contribution by Donate et al., they propose a novel Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) approach, where a weighted n-fold validation fitness scheme is used to build an ensemble of neural networks, under four different combination methods: mean, median, softmax and rank-based combinations. Several experiments were held, using six real-world time series with different characteristics and from distinct domains. Overall, the proposed approach achieved competitive results when compared with non weighted n-fold EANN ensembles, the simpler 0-fold EANN and also the popular Holt–Winters statistical method. Dan Burdescu et al. in the fifth contribution, present a system used in the medical domain for three distinct tasks: image annotation, semantic based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. An original image segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure was used to perform the segmentation of medical images. Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The annotation and semantic based retrieval task is evaluated for two annotation models: Cross Media Relevance Model and Continuous-space Relevance Model. Semantic based image retrieval is performed using the methods provided by the annotation models. The ontology used by the annotation process was created in an original manner starting from the information content provided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The experiments were made using a database containing colour images retrieved from medical domain using an endoscope and related to digestive diseases. In sixth paper by Pedraza et al., they develop a face recognition system based on soft computing techniques, which complies with privacy-by-design rules and defines a set of principles that context-aware applications (including biometric sensors) should contain to conform to European and US law. This research deals with the necessity to consider legal issues concerning privacy or human rights in the development of biometric identification in ambient intelligence systems. Clearly, context-based services and ambient intelligence (and the most promising research area in Europe, namely ambient assisted living, ALL) call for a major research effort on new identification procedures. The aim of the research by Redel-Macías et al. in paper seven is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem. In the eighth paper, Wu et al. analyse the existence criterion of loop strategies, and then present some corollaries and theorems, by which the loop strategies and chain strategies can be found, also superfluous strategies and inconsistent strategies. It presents a ranking model that indicates the weak node in strategy set and it also introduces a probability-based model which is the basis of evaluation of strategy. Additionally, this research proposes a method to generate offensive strategy, and the statistic results of simulation game prove the validity of the method. Pop et al. in the ninth paper present an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a local–global approach to the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) and a powerful local search procedure. The computational experiments on several benchmarks instances show that the hybrid algorithm is competitive to all of the known heuristics published to date. In the tenth paper Kramer et al. illustrate how methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting, and monitoring techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable, and smart energy grids. The study is based on the application of kernel methods like support vector regression and kernel density estimation as prediction methods. Furthermore, dimension reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of high-dimensional wind time series are applied. The methods are briefly introduced, related work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The experimental parts are based on real wind energy time series data from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Vera et al. in the eleventh contribution present a novel soft computing procedure based on the application of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and identification systems, which makes it possible to optimise the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving both time and financial costs and/or energy. The novel proposed approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. The final contribution, by Sakalauskas and Kriksciuniene, presents a research about financial market efficiency and to recognize major reversal points of long-term trend of stock market index, which could indicate forthcoming crisis or market raise periods. The study suggests a computational model of financial time series analysis, which combines several approaches of soft computing, including information efficiency evaluation methods (Shannon's entropy, Hurst exponent), neural networks and sensitivity analysis. The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behaviour, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index. The performance of neural network model is explored by applying sensitivity analysis and resulted in selecting smoothing parameters of the input variables. The experimental research investigates behaviour of the long-term trend of the three emerging financial markets within NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchange. Introduction of information efficiency measures improve ability of the model to recognize the approaching reversal of long-term trend from temporary market “nervousness” and can be useful for calibrating stock trading strategy.

46916127,2015-01-14,"In modern distribution grids, the task of fault
localization using conventional techniques is increasingly
becoming a challenge due to the rising domination of inverterbased,
volatile, distributed power generation. Since approved
methods from high voltage level such as reactance-based methods
lack accuracy in distribution level topology, alternative
approaches for accurate fault localization are required. Within
the scope of this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) based
solution for the localization of electric faults at distribution level
has been developed, evaluated and implemented on standard
hardware from industrial automation technology i.e. a
programmable logic controller (PLC). A reduced yet
representative model of a distribution grid incorporating a
variety of aspects influencing the accuracy of fault localization
such as distributed generation, ring network topology with open
or closed loop as well as variable fault resistance has been
developed. Current and voltage measurements generated under
various fault conditions have been used for training of an ANN.
Different ANNs have been trained with various network
structures and training algorithms and after thorough analysis
and comparison of their performance, the most suitable networks
have been implemented on hardware and tested in hardware-in-the-
loop configuration. Thereby a real-time simulator suitable for

42337406,2012-01-01T00:00:00,"New embedded predictive control applications call for more efficient ways of solving quadratic programs (QPs) in order to meet demanding real-time, power and cost requirements. A single precision QP-on-a-chip controller is proposed, implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with an iterative linear solver at its core. A novel offline scaling procedure is introduced to aid the convergence of the reduced precision solver. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental setup where an ML605 FPGA board controls a nonlinear model of a Boeing 747 aircraft running on a desktop PC through an Ethernet link. Simulations show that the quality of the closed-loop control and accuracy of individual solutions is competitive with a conventional double precision controller solving linear systems using a Riccati recursion.This work was supported by the EPSRC (Grants EP/G031576/1, EP/G030308/1 and EP/I012036/1) and the EU FP7 Project EMBOCON, as well as industrial support from Xilinx, the Mathworks, and the European Space Agency.IFAC Conference on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control 2012 (NMPC'12), Noordwijkerhout, the Netherlands on August 23 - 27, 2012",IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline),Predictive control of a Boeing 747 aircraft using an FPGA,,https://core.ac.uk/download/42337406.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
41534236,2005-01-01T08:00:00,"A real-time analogue recurrent neural network (RNN) can extract and learn the unknown dynamics (and features) of a typical control system such as a robot manipulator. The task at hand is a tracking problem in the presence of disturbances. With reference to the tasks assigned to an industrial robot, one important issue is to determine the motion of the joints and the effector of the robot. In order to model robot dynamics we use a neural network that can be implemented in hardware. The synaptic weights are modelled as variable gain cells that can be implemented with a few MOS transistors. The network output signals portray the periodicity and other characteristics of the input signal in unsupervised mode. For the specific purpose of demonstrating the trajectory learning capabilities, a periodic signal with varying characteristics is used. The developed architecture, however, allows for more general learning tasks typical in applications of identification and control. The periodicity of the input signal ensures convergence of the output to a limit cycle. Online versions of the synaptic update can be formulated using simple CMOS circuits. Because the architecture depends on the network generating a stable limit cycle, and consequently a periodic solution which is robust over an interval of parameter uncertainties, we currently place the restriction of a periodic format for the input signals. The simulated network contains interconnected recurrent neurons with continuous-time dynamics. The system emulates random-direction descent of the error as a multidimensional extension to the stochastic approximation. To achieve unsupervised learning in recurrent dynamical systems we propose a synapse circuit which has a very simple structure and is suitable for implementation in VLSI","Edith Cowan University, Research Online, Perth, Western Australia",An analogue recurrent neural networks for trajectory learning and other industrial applications,,https://core.ac.uk/download/41534236.pdf,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275613405,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"The inclusion of embedded sensors into a networked system provides useful
information for many applications. A Distributed Control System (DCS) is one of the
clearest examples where processing and communications are constrained by the client s
requirements and the capacity of the system. An embedded sensor with advanced
processing and communications capabilities supplies high level information, abstracting
from the data acquisition process and objects recognition mechanisms. The implementation
of an embedded sensor/actuator as a Smart Resource permits clients to access sensor
information through distributed network services. Smart resources can offer sensor services
as well as computing, communications and peripheral access by implementing a self-aware
based adaptation mechanism which adapts the execution profile to the context. On the
other hand, information integrity must be ensured when computing processes are
dynamically adapted. Therefore, the processing must be adapted to perform tasks in a
certain lapse of time but always ensuring a minimum process quality. In the same way,
communications must try to reduce the data traffic without excluding relevant information.
The main objective of the paper is to present a dynamic configuration mechanism to adapt
the sensor processing and communication to the client s requirements in the DCS. This
paper describes an implementation of a smart resource based on a Red, Green, Blue, and
Depth (RGBD) sensor in order to test the dynamic configuration mechanism presented.This work has been supported by the Spanish Science and Innovation Ministry MICINN under the CICYT project M2C2: ""Codiseno de sistemas de control con criticidad mixta basado en misiones"" TIN2014-56158-C4-4-P and the Programme for Research and Development PAID of the Polytechnic University of Valencia: UPV-PAID-FPI-2013.

81027260,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"We describe the implementation and deployment of a software decision support tool for the maintenance planning of gas turbines. The tool is used to plan the maintenance for turbines manufactured and maintained by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB (SIT AB) with the goal to reduce the direct maintenance costs and the often very costly production losses during maintenance downtime. The optimization problem is formally defined, and we argue that feasibility in it is NP-complete. We outline a heuristic algorithm that can quickly solve the problem for practical purposes, and validate the approach on a real-world scenario based on an oil production facility. We also compare the performance of our algorithm with results from using mixed integer linear programming, and discuss the deployment of the application. The experimental results indicate that downtime reductions up to 65% can be achieved, compared to traditional preventive maintenance. In addition, using our tool is expected to improve availability with up to 1% and reduce the number of planned maintenance days with 12%. Compared to a mixed integer programming approach, our algorithm not optimal, but is orders of magnitude faster and produces results which are useful in practice. Our test results and SIT AB’s estimates based on operational use both indicate that significant savings can be achieved by using our software tool, compared to maintenance plans with fixed intervals.Proceedings of the Twenty-First Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI'09) published by IEEE Computer SocietyCam",IEEE Computer Society,A Tool for Gas Turbine Maintenance Scheduling,,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
323091063,2013-04-07T00:00:00,"[ES] Los sistemas con conmutación de modos se definen como aquéllos que pueden exhibir diferente comportamiento dinámico en función del estado en que se encuentran. Pueden por tanto ser descritos por un conjunto finito de subsistemas dinámicos y una lógica que rige la conmutación entre ellos. Una alternativa para su control es la arquitectura multi-controlador con supervisión ya que permite utilizar controladores de modo diferentes y alcanzar así múltiples objetivos de control. Pero la conmutación de controladores suele tener como consecuencia la aparición de saltos o transitorios derivados que pueden ser inaceptables. Este tipo de sistemas y problemática son frecuentes en diferentes áreas de aplicación industrial, en donde la tecnología de control más utilizada es el Controlador Lógico Programable (PLC). Es por ello que el objetivo de este trabajo es presentar un método de diseño e implementación de un mecanismo de transferencia sin salto (BT) en una arquitectura multi-modo y multi-bucle para sistemas con conmutación de modos, en PLC y en conformidad con el estándar IEC 61131-3. La estrategia BT se basa en que controladores de modos candidatos a conmutar realicen un seguimiento a los controladores activos, siendo la detección del estado de operación actual y de los posibles estados siguientes, clave en la definición de la forma de ejecución de los algoritmos de control que componen la arquitectura. Se presentan también los pasos del diseño de la arquitectura completa así como resultados experimentales que validan la arquitectura.[EN] Switched mode systems are defined as those represented by a finite set of linear subsystems and a set of logic rules orchestrating the switching among them. A set of dynamic subsystems together with a logical system that orchestrates the switching among them could be used in order to describe it. An alternative to control them is a supervisory multi-mode controller architecture that allows to meeting multiple control objectives. But switching can consequently derived in bumps or undesirable transient responses. This type of problem is commonly encountered in several industrial application fields, where the Programmable Logic Controller (PLCs) is the most used technology. This paper describes a methodology for the design and the implementation of Bumpless Transfer (BT) mechanisms within multi-rate control architecture for switched mode systems, to be implemented in PLC following the IEC 61131-3 standard. The BT strategy is based on to make controllers which are candidate to switch track to active controllers. By detecting the system state and the feasible next states, the supervisor decides the way in which the different controllers of the architecture execute. The steps to design the complete architecture are presented and experimental results that validate the architecture are shown.MCYT y FEDER a través de los proyectos DPI2012-37806-C02-01, UPV/EHU GIU 10/20 y UFI11/28.Iriondo, N.; Estévez, E.; Priego, R.; Marcos, M.

187722098,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence methodologies, as the core of discrete control and decision support systems, have been extensively applied
in the industrial production sector. The resulting tools produce excellent results in certain cases; however, the NP-hard nature of
many discrete control or decision making problems in the manufacturing area may require unaffordable computational resources,
constrained by the limited available time required to obtain a solution. With the purpose of improving the efficiency of a control
methodology for discrete systems, based on a simulation-based optimization and the Petri net (PN) model of the real discrete
event dynamic system (DEDS), this paper presents a strategy, where a transformation applied to the model allows removing the
redundant information to obtain a smaller model containing the same useful information. As a result, faster discrete optimizations
can be implemented.This methodology is based on the use of a formalism belonging to the paradigmof thePNfor describingDEDS,

80739260,2015-06-03T00:00:00,"Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error.

The discussed methods are used in visualizing process measurements, extracting operational information, and designing estimation models for primary process variables otherwise difficult to measure in real-time. Emphasis is given to the modeling of the data with two classical machine learning paradigms; the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on an industrial deethanizer, where the goal is to identify operational modes and most sensitive variables for this full-scale unit, as well as design an inferential model for a critical process variable, the bottom ethane concentration. The study led to the definition of a fully automated monitoring tool to be implemented online in the plant's distributed control system. The results confirmed the potential of the data-derived approach, and based on the analysis, the existing control configuration of the unit could be redefined toward more consistent operations.

56861238,2011,"The quality of welding processes is governed by the occurring induced distortions yielding an increase in production costs due to necessary reworking. Especially for more complex specimens, it is difficult to evaluate the optimal configuration of welding sequences in order to minimize the distortion. Even experienced welding operators can solve this task only by trial and error which is time and cost consuming. In modern engineering the application of welding simulation is already known to be able to analyse the heat effects of welding virtually. However, the welding process is governed by complex physical interactions. Thus, recent weld thermal models are based on many simplifications. The state of the art is to apply numerical methods in order to solve the transient heat conduction equat ion. Therefore, it is not possible to use the real process parameters as input for the mathematical model. The model parameters which allow calculating a temperature field that is in best agreement with the experiments cannot be defined directly but inversely by multiple simulations runs. In case of numerical simulation software based on finite discretization schemes this approach is very time consuming and requires expert users. The weld thermal model contains an initial weakness which has to be adapted by finding an optimal set of model parameters. This process of calibration is often done against few experiments. The range of model validity is limited. An extension can be obtained by performing a calibration against multiple experiments. The focus of the paper is to show a combined mode lling technique which provides an efficient solution of the inverse heat conduction problem mentioned above. On the one hand the inverse problem is solved by application of fast weld thermal models which are closed form solutions of the heat conduction equation. In addition, a global optimization algorithm allows an automated calibration of the weld thermal model. This technique is able to provide a temperature field automatically that fits the experimental one with high accuracy within minutes on ordinary office computers. This fast paradigm permits confirming the application of welding simulation in an industrial environment as automotive industry. On the other hand, the initial model weakness is compensated by calibrating the model against multiple experiments. The unknown relationship between model and process parameters is approximated by a neural network. The validity of the model is increased successively and enables to decrease experimental effort. For a test case, it is shown that this approach yields accurate temperature fields within very short amount of time for unknown process parameters as input data to the model contributing to the requirement to construct a substitute system of the real welding process",,Fast temperature field generation for welding simulation and reduction of experimental effort,10.1007/bf03321324,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
83005667,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Purpose: The goal of this paper is to develop a pragmatic system of a production throughput
forecasting system for an automated test operation in a hard drive manufacturing plant. The
accurate forecasting result is necessary for the management team to response to any changes in
the production processes and the resources allocations.
Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we design a production throughput forecasting
system in an automated test operation in hard drive manufacturing plant. The proposed system
consists of three main stages. In the first stage, a mutual information method was adopted for
selecting the relevant inputs into the forecasting model. In the second stage, a generalized
regression neural network (GRNN) was implemented in the forecasting model development
phase. Finally, forecasting accuracy was improved by searching the optimal smoothing parameter
which selected from comparisons result among three optimization algorithms: particle swarm
optimization (PSO), unrestricted search optimization (USO) and interval halving optimization
(IHO).
Findings: The experimental result shows that (1) the developed production throughput
forecasting system using GRNN is able to provide forecasted results close to actual values, and to
projected the future trends of production throughput in an automated hard disk drive test  operation; (2) IHO algorithm performed as appropriate optimization method better than the
other two algorithms. (3) Compared with current forecasting system in manufacturing, the results
show that the proposed system’s performance is superior to the current system in prediction
accuracy and suitable for real-world application.
Originality/value: The production throughput volume is a key performance index of hard disk
drive manufacturing systems that need to be forecast. The production throughput forecasting
result is useful information for management team to respond to any changes in production
processes and resources allocation. However, a practical forecasting system for production
throughput has not been described in detail yet. The experiments were conducted on a real data
set from the final testing operation of hard disk drive manufacturing factory by using Visual Basic
Application on Microsoft Excel© to develop preliminary forecasting system for testing and
verification process. The experimental result shows that the proposed model is superior to the
performance of the current forecasting system",Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,A production throughput forecasting system in an automated hard disk drive test operation using GRNN,10.3926/jiem.1464,,"[{'title': 'Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management', 'identifiers': ['issn:2013-0953', '2013-0953']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The key concept of this new algorithm is the two-stage implementation of the steepest descendant method. At the first stage, the steepest descendant method is used to search the optimal learning constant eta and momentum term alpha for each weights updating process. At the second stage, the Delta learning rule is then employed to modify the connecting weights in terms of the optimal eta and alpha. Computer simulations show that the proposed new algorithm outmatches other learning algorithms both in converging speed and success rate. On real industrial application, we first apply the new neural network learning algorithm to the identification of a highly nonlinear injection molding barrel system. Experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm can precisely identify the complicate injection molding barrel system. Further more, a self-tuning PID controller for precise temperature control based on the trained neural network barrel model is developed.

162408305,2007-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper focuses on the results of different consumer surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006 with regard to consumers ' perceptions and reactions concerning AI in Vietnam, (mainly in Hanoi). The main results observed are as follows: - A high proportion of consumers consider AI to be a food-related risk. However, over time, there has been a slight shift from a fear of consuming poultry to a fear of preparing it (slaughtering it). - AI has had a profound effect on poultry consumption, even outside peak crisis times, more in terms of the quantity consumed (approximately a third less in 2006) than in terms of the number of consumers (6% less). - Blood and internal organs are considered particularly risky, while eggs are viewed as being safer. Poultry from industrial farms is considered to be more risky than poultry from small farms. - Purchasing practices have also been affected by AI: in Hanoi, consumers declare that they prefer to buy poultry directly from producers that they know, or from supermarkets in the case of the wealthiest consumers. A high proportion still buy live poultry from market traders, but more consumers now ask sellers to slaughter it for them. With a view to lessening market shocks in the wake of the crisis while maintaining the priority of consumer safety, a number of measures should nevertheless be implemented: Risk communication should not over-emphasize AI as a food-related risk. - Reliable safe distribution channels should be promoted (with reliable quality signs and controls) in order to encourage safe production and poultry consumption. Otherwise, a market recovery will only benefit supermarkets and large-scale farmers capable of supplying supermarkets. - As numerous live birds are still slaughtered in urban market places, facilities should be provided for safe slaughter. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the provision of a real ""cold chain"" with a view to promoting the sale of slaughtered poultry.

275626576,2015-02-01T00:00:00,"The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-014-1307-6.Control architectures based on Emotions are becoming promising solutions for the implementation of future robotic agents. The basic controllers of the architecture are the emotional processes that decide which behaviors of the robot must activate to fulfill the objectives. The number of emotional processes increases (hundreds of millions/s) with the complexity level of the application, reducing the processing capacity of the main processor to solve complex problems (millions of decisions in a given instant). However, the potential parallelism of the emotional processes permits their execution in parallel on FPGAs or Multicores, thus enabling slack computing in the main processor to tackle more complex dynamic problems. In this paper, an emotional architecture for mobile robotic agents is presented. The workload of the emotional processes is evaluated. Then, the main processor is extended with FPGA co-processors through Ethernet link. The FPGAs will be in charge of the execution of the emotional processes in parallel. Different Stratix FPGAs are compared to analyze their suitability to cope with the proposed mobile robotic agent applications. The applications are set up taking into account different environmental conditions, robot dynamics and emotional states. Moreover, the applications are run also on Multicore processors to compare their performance in relation to the FPGAs. Experimental results show that Stratix IV FPGA increases the performance in about one order of magnitude over the main processor and solves all the considered problems. Quad-Core increases the performance in 3.64 times, allowing to tackle about 89 % of the considered problems. Quad-Core has a lower cost than a Stratix IV, so more adequate solution but not for the most complex application. Stratix III could be applied to solve problems with around the double of the requirements that the main processor could support. Finally, a Dual-Core provides slightly better performance than stratix III and it is relatively cheaper.This work was supported in part under Spanish Grant PAID/2012/325 of ""Programa de Apoyo a la Investigacion y Desarrollo.

207901081,1995-06-30,"AbstractOne reason why Distributed AI (DAI) technology has been deployed in relatively few real-size applications is that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperative problem solving which specifies how agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic and unpredictable environments. As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used to outline a proposal for the next generation of multi-agent systems",Published by Elsevier B.V.,Controlling cooperative problem solving in industrial multi-agent systems using joint intentions ,10.1016/0004-3702(94)00020-2,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

197737176,2015-07-21T08:31:36,"none2The issue of monitoring profiles has been defined as being one of the most promising areas of research in statistical process control. One immediate difficulty is how to characterize a profile. As a matter of fact, the identification of a statistical model may become more difficult than expected, thus representing an obstacle to the introduction of profile monitoring in actual applications. For example, when a profile represents the physical dimensions of a machined surface, as it results in manufacturing applications, measurements data often exhibit complex spatial correlation.
The aim of this work is to explore a different approach for monitoring profiles, which uses the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network. The implementation of this neural network is based on a set of profiles which are representative of the process in its natural, or in-control, state.
Throughout the paper, a real case study related to profiles data obtained by a common machining process is used. With reference to the Phase II of profile monitoring, performance of the proposed approach are compared to those of multivariate control charting of the parameters vector. Although the proposed neural network does not produce always outperforming results, it presents comparable performance in several cases. The main advantage presented by the approach is that the model of profile data is “autonomously” derived by the neural network, without requiring any further intervention by the quality practitioner. This feature may create an important bridge between profile monitoring and quality monitoring of several specifications in actual applications.www.enbis.orgPacella M.; Semeraro Q.Pacella, Massimo; Semeraro, Q",ENBIS,A comparison of neural network and control charting for monitoring profiles in manufacturing processes,,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

275591294,2012-01-01T00:00:00,"Polynomial constraint solving plays a prominent role in several areas of hardware and software analysis and verification, e.g.; termination proving, program invariant generation and hybrid system verification, to name a few. In this paper we propose a new method for solving non-linear constraints based on encoding the problem into an SMT problem considering only linear arithmetic. Unlike other existing methods, our method focuses on proving satisfiability of the constraints rather than on proving unsatisfiability, which is more relevant in several applications as we illustrate with several examples. Nevertheless, we also present new techniques based on the analysis of unsatisfiable cores that allow one to efficiently prove unsatisfiability too for a broad class of problems. The power of our approach is demonstrated by means of extensive experiments comparing our prototype with state-of-the-art tools on benchmarks taken both from the academic and the industrial world. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.This work has been partially supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MEC/MICINN, under grants TIN 2007-68093-C02-01 and TIN 2007-68093-C02-02.Borralleras, C.; Lucas Alba, S.; Oliveras ., A.; Rodriguez-Carbonell, E.; Rubio ., A.

53760647,2006-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper deals with the problems in setting up stereo-vision systems for contactless measurement of dimensional parameters in industrial environments. Two implicit calibration algorithms for the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3-D) real-world coordinates of objects from pairs of two-dimensional image coordinates have been implemented and compared. The former is based on a direct linear transformation, while the latter on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results of the comparison made on artificial and real objects are finally reported in terms of statistical analysis of the reconstruction error",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',A Comparison Between Stereo-Vision Techniques for the Reconstruction of 3-D Coordinates of Objects,10.1109/TIM.2006.881034,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
92169625,2003-01-01T00:00:00,"Mechatronic design is the integrated design of a mechanical system and its embedded control system. In order to make proper choices early in the design stage, tools are required that support modelling and simulation of physical systems––together with the controllers––with parameters that are directly related to the real-world system. Such software tools are becoming available now. Components in various physical domains (e.g. mechanical or electrical) can easily be selected from a library and combined into a ‘process’ that can be controlled by block-diagram-based (digital) controllers. A few examples will be discussed that show the use of such a tool in various stages of the design. The examples include a typical mechatronic system with a flexible transmission, a mobile robot, and an industrial linear motor with a neural-network-based learning feed-forward controller that compensates for cogging",'Elsevier BV',Mechatronic Design,10.1016/s0957-4158(03)00042-4,,,core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
148539651,2003-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents a novel method to determine the parameters of a first-order plus dead-time model using neural networks. The outputs of the neural networks are the gain, dominant time constant, and apparent time delay. By combining this algorithm with a conventional PI or PID controller, we also present an adaptive controller which requires very little a priori knowledge about the plant under control. The simplicity of the scheme for real-time control provides a new approach for implementing neural network applications for a variety of on-line industrial control problems. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and adaptive property of the proposed scheme.Department of Electrical Engineerin",'Elsevier BV',On-line lower-order modeling via neural networks,10.1016/S0019-0578(07)60007-X,,"[{'title': 'ISA Transactions', 'identifiers': ['0019-0578', 'issn:0019-0578']}]",core,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

is very important because their deterioration may cause the value lost and even
the product rejection by the buyer. For this reason, in this paper we present a
cooperative monitoring system for the delivery of fresh products. The system
consists of fixed wireless nodes and a mobile wireless node that is installed in
the packet. This mobile node is able to take data of the internal temperature,
external temperature and the 3 axis movement. With the information stored in
the network, a vendor can know the optimal conditions of the transport. Finally,
we test the maximum distance to the fixed nodes, as well as the data collected by
the sensor.Sendra, S.; Lloret, J.; Lacuesta, R.; Jimenez, JM. (2015). Cooperative Monitoring of the Delivery of Fresh Products.
