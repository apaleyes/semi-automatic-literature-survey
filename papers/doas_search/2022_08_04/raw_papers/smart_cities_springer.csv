This also presents a new vulnerability as hackers have more opportunities to attack users via the wearables. As the current knowledge-based wearable authentication schemes, such as passwords, PINs, or pattern locks, are overwhelming for users, we need an authentication system that can validate a user implicitly, i.e., without the need for active user interaction. In this work, we present an authentication system for the wearables leveraging the sensing and computation power of smartphones and IoT connectivity. We develop a smartphone application ( TFL Auth app) using the TensorFlow Lite framework and an on-phone convolutional neural network (CNN) model that listens to a user’s breathing patterns through the microphone and verifies the user’s identity in real-time before sending the acceptance/rejection notification to a paired wearable that we want to secure.

The passenger-count inside a car will be restricted based on the vehicle capacity and the COVID-19 hot-spot zone. Traffic rules will be impacted to align with a similar contagious outbreak. The on-road ‘Yellow-Vulture’ cameras need to incorporate such surveillance rules to monitor related anomalies for preventing contamination. To maintain safe-distance, an automatic surveillance system will be preferred by the Government very soon. Moreover, facial mask usage during the journey has become an essential habit to stop the spread of the infection. In this article, we have proposed a deep-Learning based framework that employs an augmented image data set to provide proper surveillance in the transport system to maintain the health protocols. Fast and accurate detection of the number of passengers inside a car and their face masks from the traffic inspection camera feed has been demonstrated.

Its powerful and centralized architecture makes a balanced contribution to the management of sustainable applications through efficient processes. These networks also systematically keep track of mobile devices and decrease the extra overheads in the communication cost. Many solutions are proposed to cope with data transferring for the critical system, however, mobile devices, on the other hand, require long-distance communication links with minimal retransmissions. Furthermore, the mobile network is highly infected by security attacks and compromised the IoT architecture for both the intermediate layers and end-users. Therefore, this paper presents an adaptive routes migration model for sustainable applications with the collaboration of SDN architecture and limits the disconnectivity time in data transporting along with efficient management of network services.

A general parameter called probability of reception ( p r ) describes the noise level in this model. The success or failure of packet reception between sender and receiver can be used to assess the impact of network noise. The LEACH algorithm’s energy model has been modified to include the noise factor ( p r ). Based on the new modified energy model, new analytical formulas for the optimal number of clusters and the optimal probability of a node becoming a cluster head are derived. Furthermore, we investigate what network dimensions are required to achieve the optimal number of clusters in a noisy environment, as this will increase the network’s lifetime. It is demonstrated that the optimal number of clusters, and thus the optimal probability of CHs, are shown to be achieved by two factors: short wireless links formed within the clusters and equal network layout dimensions. Noise is shown to have a significant negative impact on the LEACH protocol’s operation, particularly on network life time, throughput, and the protocol’s stability and instability periods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13510-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is used to increase the overall operational efficiency. IIoT is considered as the backbone of the contemporary industries. For this purpose, strong security foundations have to be deployed with IIoT. This accelerates the industrial automation process by enrolling thousands of IoT devices and thus befitting the scattered connection and constrained functionalities of the IoT devices. In the Industrial Internet of Things, abnormal traffic detection is an emerging dilemma in network security. It can be ensured by monitoring the traffic flow in large-scale networks. In this connection, the deep learning paradigm has been accepted as the mainstream phenomenon in the field of abnormal traffic detection. It has achieved optimal results due to the constant improvement of computer performance with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Majority of the existing methods are based on supervised learning. As a result, due to numerous constraints, obtaining and marking abnormal traffic data samples in real life is extremely difficult. In addition, due to the diversity and complexity of the abnormal network data, the adaptability of various detection methods is low as well as difficult to judge the new abnormal traffic. Based on the above problems, this paper has proposed a semi-supervised abnormal flow detection framework in the IIoT based network scenario. The proposed model is named Memory Augment Based on Generative Adversarial Network (MeAEG-Net). It detects anomalies by training only normal flow of sample data and comparing the reconstruction errors of the underlying characteristics of input flow of generator module. To improve the generator's training, generative adversarial network has been deployed to tackle the problem of the autoencoder which is susceptible to noise. The generator uses an autoencoder and decoder structure. In addition, the memory augments module is introduced to the autoencoder's sub-network to reduce the generator module's generalization ability and raise the abnormal traffic reconstruction error. Our experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can achieve a good effect of abnormal traffic detection in IIoT based networks under the premise of learning normal traffic data samples and improving the overall performance in all sectors of the industry.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-022-02992-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Mitigating its global effects requires international actions. The European Union (EU) is leading several initiatives focused on reducing the problems. Specifically, the Climate Action tries to both decrease EU greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency by reducing the amount of primary energy consumed, and it has pointed to the development of efficient building energy management systems as key. In traditional buildings, households are responsible for continuously monitoring and controlling the installed Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. Unnecessary energy consumption might occur due to, for example, forgetting devices turned on, which overwhelms users due to the need to tune the devices manually. Nowadays, smart buildings are automating this process by automatically tuning HVAC systems according to user preferences in order to improve user satisfaction and optimize energy consumption. Towards achieving this goal, in this paper, we compare 36 Machine Learning algorithms that could be used to forecast indoor temperature in a smart building. More specifically, we run experiments using real data to compare their accuracy in terms of R-coefficient and Root Mean Squared Error and their performance in terms of Friedman rank. The results reveal that the ExtraTrees regressor has obtained the highest average accuracy (0.97%) and performance (0,058%) over all horizons.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12667-020-00376-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, predicting real time demand at the micro-geographical level is a challenging task due to its underlying complexity, and prior work has focused largely on predicting one-step-ahead demand at a macro-geographical level, often using classical times series models that do not consider exogenous factors or quantify the prediction uncertainty in a probabilistic setting. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based framework with a novel architecture to predict multi-step-ahead real time travel demand, along with uncertainty estimation. The model is multi-stage and captures both spatial and temporal aspects. We employ the encoder-decoder framework with variations of convolution and LSTM units, and incorporate an attention mechanism into the model to quantify the interdependence between the input and output elements.

Among many others, Swarm Intelligence (SI), a substantial branch of Artificial Intelligence, is built on the intelligent collective behavior of social swarms in nature. One of the most popular SI paradigms, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), is presented in this work. Many changes have been made to PSO since its inception in the mid 1990s. Since their learning about the technique, researchers and practitioners have developed new applications, derived new versions, and published theoretical studies on the potential influence of various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. Various perspectives are surveyed in this paper on existing and ongoing research, including algorithm methods, diverse application domains, open issues, and future perspectives, based on the Systematic Review (SR) process. More specifically, this paper analyzes the existing research on methods and applications published between 2017 and 2019 in a technical taxonomy of the picked content, including hybridization, improvement, and variants of PSO, as well as real-world applications of the algorithm categorized into: health-care, environmental, industrial, commercial, smart city, and general aspects applications. Some technical characteristics, including accuracy, evaluation environments, and proposed case study are involved to investigate the effectiveness of different PSO methods and applications.

Many data collection methods have proposed, but still more efficiency and better results are required. In this paper, a novel and secure data collection method from IoT devices has proposed. In this paper, SEED (Secure and energy efficient data-collection) method has discussed. It includes creation of aggregator nodes and path discovery algorithms. Integrity of data is analysed by using MD5 hashing technique. This hashing technique is one of the most usable techniques as compared to other. In the regard of implementation of this novel secure and energy data collection method, MD5 is used to just hash the processing data in the entire process. In earlier scenarios, there were various issues regarding fault tolerance, congestion, energy wastage, path discovery and load balancing in a network. To resolve these issues, updating of the aggregator node is done after each failure or transmission. Transmission of huge amount of data can create different challenges in network. This research is completely different from other existing researches of data collection with routing as it deals with sink node by using a unique path discovery algorithm.

Providing real-time anomaly detection for time series data streams is highly valuable since it enables to automatically recognize and discard or repair sensor faults in time-sensitive processes. In this paper, we implement a data cleaning process that detects and classifies traffic anomalies distinguishing between sensor faults and unusual traffic conditions, and removes sensor faults from the input of the traffic simulation model, improving its performance.

Nevertheless, few have considered the notion of spiking or non-spiking neural networks (NNs) and their performance in TSC tasks. Seminal Reservoir Computing (s-RC) with random connected recurrent neural networks is categorized among the fastest and most efficient end-to-end NNs that have been applied to TSC problems. Although the s-RC architecture is absolutely suited for dynamic (temporal) data processing, it fails to achieve significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art fully trainable NNs. Along this thread, the present study proposes a novel algorithm for training the reservoir by fusing nonlinear optimal control theory with reservoir computing (RC) theory, which opens a new approach to optimizing RC predicted values (estimated class) in a specific timestamp along the desired trajectory (true class). For this purpose, TSC tasks were reformulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, conducive to an approximate solution to a learning rule for the reservoir of spiking or non-spiking neurons, using the adaptive/approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method. The proposed framework that known as Trainable Reservoir Computing (t-RC) involves an online actor–critic method which is used to project the effect of the output error into the reservoir’s parameters adjusting rule so as to ensure the classification error is minimized. To evaluate the TSC adaptability of the newly proposed RC framework and state-of-the-art NN-based methods, varying experiments on 22 univariate and multivariate time series datasets (UCR and UEA datasets) were performed. The findings divulge that the proposed framework outperforms other RC methods in learning capacity and accuracy and attains classification accuracy comparable with the best fully trainable deep neural networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06827-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Though the cloud enables the deployment and management of business processes (BPs), it is challenging to deal with the enormous fluctuating resource demands and ensure smooth execution of business operations in containerized multi-cloud. Therefore, there is a need to ensure elastic provisioning of resources to tackle the over and under-provisioning problems and satisfy the objectives of cloud providers and end-users considering the quality of service (QoS) and service level agreement (SLA) constraints. In this article, an efficient multi-agent autonomic resource provisioning framework is proposed to ensure the effective execution of BPs in a containerized multi-cloud environment with guaranteed QoS. To improve the performance and ensure elastic resource provisioning, autonomic computing is utilized to monitor the resource usage and predict the future resource demands, then resources are scaled based on demand. Initially, the required resources for executing the incoming workloads are identified by clustering the workloads into CPU and I/O intensive, and the local agent achieves this with the help of an initialization algorithm and K-means clustering. Then, the analysis phase predicts the workload demand using the proposed enhanced deep stacked auto-encoder (EDSAE), further, the containers are scaled based on the prediction outcomes, finally, the multi-objective termite colony optimization (MOTCO) algorithm is used by the global agent to find suitable containers for executing the clustered workloads. The proposed framework has been implemented in the Container Cloudsim platform and evaluated using the business workload traces. The overall simulation results proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to other approaches in terms of SLA violation rate, CPU utilization, response time, execution cost, energy consumption, make-span, and throughput.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-022-04120-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While there is a proliferation of ideas for various applications that can be delivered via drone services, the subject of drone service provisioning has received relatively less attention and, hence, is not well understood. We envision that a variety of drone applications (e.g. renting a drone as a security guard, to pick up and deliver something or to take an interesting photo) can be delivered as a service, using a common set of underlying service provisioning principles, such as making decisions as to whom to service next. In this paper, we study by simulation how different decision-making strategies for drones impact clients and service providers. In particular, the trade-offs between maximising provider revenue versus maximising a client’s personal satisfaction, and different combinations of factors that influence drone behaviour (e.g. speed, distribution of clients, criteria for judging client requests, service duration, effect of battery and whether drones are allowed to change their target client on-the-fly) are investigated.

This hypothetical 3D network of virtual spaces is increasingly shaping alternatives to the imaginaries of data-driven smart cities, as it represents ways of living in virtually inhabitable cities. At the heart of the Metaverse is a computational understanding of human users’ cognition, emotion, motivation, and behavior that reduces the experience of everyday life to logic and calculative rules and procedures. This implies that human users become more knowable and manageable and their behavior more predictable and controllable, thereby serving as passive data points feeding the AI and analytics system that they have no interchange with or influence on. This paper examines the forms, practices, and ethics of the Metaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities, paying particular attention to: privacy, surveillance capitalism, dataveillance, geosurveillance, human health and wellness, and collective and cognitive echo-chambers. Achieving this aim will provide the answer to the main research question driving this study: What ethical implications will the Metaverse have on the experience of everyday life in post-pandemic urban society? In terms of methodology, this paper deploys a thorough review of the current status of the Metaverse, urban informatics, urban science, and data-driven smart cities literature, as well as trends, research, and developments. We argue that the Metaverse will do more harm than good to human users due to the massive misuse of the hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization underlying the associated global architecture of computer mediation. It follows that the Metaverse needs to be re-cast in ways that re-orientate in how users are conceived; recognize their human characteristics; and take into account the moral values and principles designed to realize the benefits of socially disruptive technologies while mitigating their pernicious effects. This paper contributes to the academic debates in the emerging field of data-driven smart urbanism by highlighting the ethical implications posed by the Metaverse as speculative fiction that illustrates the concerns raised by the pervasive and massive use of advanced technologies in data-driven smart cities. In doing so, it seeks to aid policy-makers in better understanding the pitfalls of the Metaverse and their repercussions upon the wellbeing of human users and the core values of urban society.

Unavailability of relevant data from blockage-originated flooding events and complex nature of debris accumulation are highlighted factors hindering the research within the blockage management domain. Wollongong City Council (WCC) blockage conduit policy is the leading formal guidelines to incorporate blockage into design guidelines; however, are criticized by the hydraulic engineers for its dependence on the post-flood visual inspections (i.e., visual blockage) instead of peak floods hydraulic investigations (i.e., hydraulic blockage). Apparently, no quantifiable relationship is reported between the visual blockage and hydraulic blockage; therefore, many consider WCC blockage guidelines invalid. This paper exploits the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), motivated by its recent success, and attempts to relate visual blockage with hydraulic blockage by proposing a deep learning pipeline to predict hydraulic blockage from an image of the culvert. Two experiments are performed where the conventional pipeline and end-to-end learning approaches are implemented and compared in the context of predicting hydraulic blockage from a single image. In experiment one, the conventional deep learning pipeline approach (i.e., feature extraction using CNN and regression using ANN) is adopted. In contrast, in experiment two, end-to-end deep learning models (i.e., E2E_ MobileNet, E2E_ BlockageNet) are trained and compared with the conventional pipeline approach. Dataset (i.e., Hydraulics-Lab Blockage Dataset (HBD), Visual Hydraulics-Lab Dataset (VHD)) used in this research were collected from laboratory experiments performed using scaled physical models of culverts.

In addition to the network lifetime requirement, some critical event-driven applications (e.g., forest fire detection) have other requirements such as response time and reliability to be met to avoid serious damage. A plethora of cluster-based routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. However, none of the existing protocols address these three issues jointly. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Data Routing Strategy (thereafter called HDRS) for fog-enabled WSNs. Firstly, we propose an energy-efficient multi-Fog Nodes (FNs)-based clustered network model. Secondly, we devise a novel approach aimed at separating the routing decision and data forwarding to reduce the communication cost and preserve the limited energy of sensor nodes. In this approach, the ordinary sensor nodes and Cluster Heads (CHs) concentrate only on data forwarding while the routing decision is taken at the FN level, owing to its high ability in terms of storage, energy, and computation. Thirdly, we propose to properly adjusting the network topology by considering the addition and removal of faulty nodes. Interestingly, we put proper node fault-handling rules, which guarantee high-level reliability without any loss of data or causing disruption to the network services. Finally, the proposed protocol is evaluated using the forest fire detection application. The simulations results reveal that HDRS outperforms quality of service-based routing protocol for software-defined WSNs with an improvement of 8.23 % in network lifetime and 19.02 % in network response time. The other main advantages of HDRS are ease of implementation, and low time and message complexities.

MEC represents a defining function of 5G, offering significant computational power at a reduced latency, allowing to augment the capabilities of user equipments while preserving their battery life. However, the demands generated by a plethora of innovative and concurrent IT services requiring high quality of service and quality of experience levels will likely overwhelm the—albeit considerable—resources available in 5G and Beyond scenarios. To take full advantage of its potential, MEC needs to be paired with innovative resource management solutions capable of effectively addressing the highly dynamic aspects of the scenario and of properly considering the heterogeneous and ever-changing nature of next generation IT services, prioritizing the assignment of resources in a highly dynamic and contextual fashion. This calls for the adoption of Artificial Intelligence based tools, implementing self-* approaches capable of learning the best resource management strategy to adapt to the ever changing conditions.

Therefore, various countries are adopting biometric solutions as security measures. Biometric technologies provide the potential security framework to make banking more convenient and secure than it has ever been. These technologies are gaining much popularity because of the ease in capturing biometric data in real-time using one’s mobile phone. At the same time, the exponential growth of enrollment in the biometric system produces a massive amount of high-dimensional data. To overcome performance-related issues arising due to the resulting data deluge, this paper aims to propose a distributed mobile biometric system based on a high-performance cluster Cloud. In this paper, a Cloud-based mobile biometric authentication framework (BAMCloud) is proposed that uses dynamic signatures for authentication. The process flow of the BAMCloud system involves capturing data using any handheld mobile device, followed by its storage, preprocessing, and training of the system in a distributed manner over the Cloud. MapReduce has been implemented on the Hadoop platform to reduce the processing time. For model training, The Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network has been used. It achieves a speed of 8.5 times the original speed and performance of 96.23%. Furthermore, the cost-benefit analysis of the implemented system shows that the cost of implementation and execution of the system is less than the existing ones. The experiments demonstrate that better performance is achieved by implementing the proposed framework as compared to other methods used in recent literature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-13514-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional contact tracing is used to detect newly infected individuals by tracing their previous contacts, and by selectively checking and isolating any individuals likely to have been infected. Digital contact tracing with the utilisation of smartphones was contrived as a technological aid to improve this manual, slow and tedious process. Nevertheless, despite the high hopes raised when smartphone-based contact tracing apps were introduced as a measure to reduce the spread of the COVID-19, their efficiency has been moderately low. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating digital contact tracing apps, based on an epidemic model, which will be used not only to evaluate the deployed Apps against the COVID-19 but also to determine how they can be improved for future pandemics. Firstly, the model confirms the moderate effectiveness of the deployed digital contact tracing, confirming the fact that it could not be used as the unique measure to fight against the COVID-19, and had to be combined with additional measures. Secondly, several improvements are proposed (and evaluated) to increase the efficiency of digital control tracing to become a more useful tool in the future.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17024-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, in constrained scenarios, the number of UAV-based aerial datasets is still low, which comparatively focuses on specific tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper, we present a high-resolution UAV-based image-dataset, named “NITRDrone” focusing on aerial image segmentation tasks especially extracting the road networks from the aerial images. The images and video sequences in this dataset are captured over different locations of the NITR campus area, covering around 650 acres. Thus, it provides many diversified scenarios to be considered while analyzing aerial images. In particular, the dataset is prepared to address the existing challenges in UAV-based aerial image segmentation problems. Extensive experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed dataset to address the aerial segmentation problems through the existing state-of-the-art methodologies. Out of the considered baseline methodologies, U-Net performs the best with an intersection of union (IoU) of 0.77, followed DeepLabplusException (IoU: 0.74) and SegNet (IoU: 0.68).

Hence, a digital twins end-to-end multi-branch object detection framework with feature level selection is presented in this work. First, a five-level feature pyramid is adopted with a set of detection heads to construct an anchor-free detection backbone. Then, a learning-based selection strategy is presented to help obtain better feature level selection performance. Experimental results on general object detection datasets show that our framework can achieve 39.2 average precision (AP) on the COCO dataset and 10.2 miss rate (MR) on the CityPersons dataset. Furthermore, experimental results on cross-dataset settings, including Cityscapes, Caltech, SIM 10k, KITTI datasets, have also proved the good generalization ability of our framework.

Due to the sequential nature, reinforcement learning has been employed to iteratively produce recommendations based on an observed stream of user behavior. In this setting, a recommendation agent interacts with the environments (users) by sequentially recommending items (actions) to maximize users’ overall long-term cumulative rewards. However, most reinforcement learning-based recommendation models only focus on extrinsic rewards based on user feedback, leading to sub-optimal policies if user-item interactions are sparse and fail to obtain the dynamic rewards based on the users’ preferences. As a remedy, we propose a dynamic intrinsic reward signal integrated with a contrastive discriminator-augmented reinforcement learning framework. Concretely, our framework contains two modules: (1) a contrastive learning module is employed to learn the representation of item sequences; (2) an intrinsic reward learning function to imitate the user’s internal dynamics. Furthermore, we combine static extrinsic reward and dynamic intrinsic reward to train a sequential recommender system based on double Q-learning. We integrate our framework with five representative sequential recommendation models. Specifically, our framework augments these recommendation models with two output layers: the supervised layer that applies cross-entropy loss to perform ranking and the other for reinforcement learning.

This is because of their heterogeneous nature, their dependence on private information, and their enormous scope arrangement. Thus, purposeful or unplanned openings of these frameworks can result in calamitous impacts, which makes it basic to set up vigorous safety efforts. Currently, there is an increase in the present security confrontation with the epidemic growth of cyber-physical systems. There has been an influx of susceptibility, risks, attacks, and controls for the emerging latest generation of CPS.

Seniors suffering from such impairments notice a slight deterioration in their cognitive abilities, which may lead to memory loss and behavioural disorders. In consequence, such seniors refrain from doing their everyday outdoor activities. Technology, e.g. smartphones, wearables and artificial intelligence, can provide seniors and their relatives with a variety of monitoring tools. In a nutshell, locations are analysed and, under specific situations, alarms are raised so that caregivers urgently informed. In this context, the discovery and prediction of trajectories and behaviours play a key role in deploying effective monitoring solutions. In this paper, we present a real-time smartphone-based monitoring system, called SafeMove , to discover and predict elderly people behaviours by analyzing outdoor trajectories. This is achieved by firstly analysing the elder’s mobility data previously collected using the proposed model called SpaceTime-Convolutional Neural Network (ST-CNN) in order to predict the most popular locations he/she might visit in the next time. Based on the predicted locations, the elder can be monitored in bounded region.

Many real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, traffic signals, and industrial automation can now be trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. These applications are designed to take benefit of DRL in order to improve the monitoring as well as measurements in industrial internet of things for automation identification system. The complexity of these environments means that it is more appropriate to use multi-agent systems rather than a single-agent. However, in non-stationary environments multi-agent systems can suffer from increased number of observations, limiting the scalability of algorithms. This study proposes a model to tackle the problem of scalability in DRL algorithms in transportation domain. A partition-based approach is used in the proposed model to reduce the complexity of the environment. This partition-based approach helps agents to stay in their working area. This reduces the complexity of the learning environment and the number of observations for each agent. The proposed model uses generative adversarial imitation learning and behavior cloning, combined with a proximal policy optimization algorithm, for training multiple agents in a dynamic environment.

Specifically, the requirement for a high quality of experience (QoE) for video streaming services is a crucial prerequisite for a range of use cases, including smart surveillance, smart healthcare, smart agriculture and many more. However, providing a high QoE for video streaming is challenging due to underlying dynamic network conditions. To address this issue, several adaptive bit rate (ABR) algorithms based on predetermined rules have been developed. However, they do not generalize well to a wide variety of network conditions. ABR algorithms, based on reinforcement learning (RL), have been proven to be more effective at generalizing to varying network conditions but they still have limitations, specifically, constrained exploration and high variance in value estimates. In this paper, we propose asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) based actor-learner architectures for generating the adaptive bit rates for video streaming in IoT environments. To address the existing issues, we propose integrating two advanced A3C algorithms: Follow then Forage Exploration (FFE) and Averaged A3C. We demonstrate their efficacy in improving the QoE over vanilla A3C. Additionally, we also demonstrate the benefits of the proposed architecture for video streaming under different network conditions and for different variants of the QoE metric.

Due to this, the visually impaired (VI) are at more risk than the sighted ones. To gain more security and safety, they need a solution to deal with their problem. This experimentation aims to develop a hardware–software integrated solution that can detect stray animals. Along with the detection, the solution should also provide the distance of those objects from the user and alert them if it is getting closer. To put this experiment together, Jetson NANO and ZED mini camera have been chosen for processing and image capturing to make the solution mobile and accurate as they are leading hardware devices. A novel approach involving quantization and anchor-optimization has been proposed using Single-Shot Detector (SSD) Resnet 50 FPN as the base model. The model has been compressed by quantization to reduce the inference time, and anchor optimization has been done to compensate for the accuracy loss faced during quantization. We have performed experimentation by training the original model, anchor-optimized model, and quantization plus anchor-optimized model using batch sizes 64 and 8. This experimentation has been done to understand the effect of anchor-optimization and quantization on the base model and the effect of the batch size used for training on different model versions. The performance of all the models with applied quantization and anchor-optimization for both batch sizes 64 and 8 has been noted in mAP. The mAP of the quantized plus anchor-optimized model trained using batch size 64 was the highest, i.e. 93.5%.

This ability plays an important role in advanced network management. The tasks of traffic characterization and application identification are usually implemented by individual models. However, when multiple models are deployed in the online environment, this causes a dramatic increase in the complexity, resource demand and maintenance costs. In this paper, an efficient multi-task learning method named multi-task transformer (MTT) is proposed. It simultaneously classifies the traffic characterization and application identification tasks. The proposed model considers the input packet as a sequence of bytes and applies a multi-head attention mechanism to extract features. Experiments are conducted on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of MTT. $$F_1$$ F 1 scores of 98.75% and 99.35% have been achieved for application identification and traffic characterization, respectively.

In this work, we focus on managing data redundancies in connected environments. Existing approaches suffer from (i) disregarding edge data redundancies either at the edge or at the core of the network; (ii) disregarding sensor mobility and the dynamicity of the network; (iii) disregarding the limited resources of edge devices; (iv) disregarding network/infrastructure resources; and (v) disregarding data consumer needs/requirements when cleaning the data redundancies.

Thus, in this paper, we introduce an extended queueing network to model the relationship between the parallelism and tuple’s average sojourn time with limited buffers. Based on this model, we also propose greedy algorithms to calculate the optimal parallelism for both the minimum latency and maximum throughput with resource constraints. To fairly evaluate the performance of different models, a random parameter generator for the streaming topology is presented.

To address these challenges, recent research suggests that organizations should develop specific capabilities for AI implementation. Currently, we lack a thorough understanding of how certain capabilities facilitate AI implementation. It remains unclear how they help organizations to cope with AI’s unique characteristics. To address this research gap, we employ a qualitative research approach and conduct 25 explorative interviews with experts on AI implementation. We derive four organizational capabilities for AI implementation: AI Project Planning and Co-Development help to cope with the inscrutability in AI, which complicates the planning of AI projects and communication between different stakeholders. Data Management and AI Model Lifecycle Management help to cope with the data dependency in AI, which challenges organizations to provide the proper data foundation and continuously adjust AI systems as the data evolves. We contribute to our understanding of the sociotechnical implications of AI’s characteristics and further develop the concept of organizational capabilities as an important success factor for AI implementation.

The distributed network of IoT devices relies on centralized architecture to compensate for their lack of resources. Within this complex network, it is crucial to ensure the security and privacy of data in the IIoT systems as they involve real-time functions that manage people’s movement and industrial materials like chemicals, radio-active goods, and large equipment. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been widely used to detect and thwart cyber-attacks on such systems. However, these are inefficient for the multi-layered IIoT networks which include heterogeneous protocol standards and topologies. With the need for a novel security method, the integration of collaborative IDS (CIDS) and blockchain has become a disruptive technology to ensure secure and trustable network transactions. Which detection methodology is suitable for this integration, and IIoT? Will blockchain render IIoT completely immune to cyber-attacks?

In this paper, we depart from conventional wisdom and propose Glider , a new congestion control protocol that uses deep reinforcement learning to be more versatile and adaptive to dynamic environments. In particular, Glider uses a framework based on Deep Q-Network, that a sender keeps adapting its congestion control strategies by continuously interacting with the network environment. In addition, the sender constantly sends data, making it challenging to apply reinforcement learning algorithms that require step-by-step state computation to congestion control. Therefore, we design a Dynamic Bisection Division Algorithm (DBDA) to discretize the packet transmission process into steps to ensure Glider ’s feasibility on congestion control. We have used an extensive array of experiments on Pantheon to show that Glider can adapt well to varying buffer sizes and is resilient to random loss. Moreover, on wide-area inter-data center links, it can achieve 6.4 $$\times$$ × and 1.4 $$\times$$ × higher throughput than TCP CUBIC and BBR, respectively, and comparable performance as other learning-based congestion control protocols in the literature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-022-01018-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Hence, the popularity of Internet of Thing (IoT) is increasing quickly across industries. In such networks, the sensors represent the eyes of the IoT that collect data about different environments and states, while the sink node forms the brain of the network that must analyze the collected data and take decisions. However, the big amount of data collected by the sensors leads, from one hand, to consume the limited energy of the sensor and, from another hand, to complicate the exploitation of the data at the sink for decision making. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier prediction mechanism in order to handle big data collected by sensor networks based on the clustering scheme. The prediction model uses the least squares approximation method which is applied at both tiers of each cluster: sensors and cluster-heads (CHs). At the first tier, each sensor applies the prediction model in order to send a reduced set of data to its appropriate CH; At the second tier, the CH combines data coming from sensors and provides a predictive model to the sink, representing data for all sensors of the cluster. Extensive simulations on real sensor data collected from several applications demonstrated that our mechanism can efficiently reduce the data transmission and save the network energy, while maintaining an acceptable data accuracy level.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-022-09914-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is the most challenging task to determine the optimum position of the initial clusters’ centroids at the very first iteration. This paper proposes an approach to find the optimal initial centroids efficiently to reduce the number of iterations and execution time . To analyze the effectiveness of our proposed method, we have utilized different real-world datasets to conduct experiments.

However, there are two main challenges. First, the sensor environment is equipped with a heterogeneous set of data sources including hardware and software sensors, and oftentimes humans as complex sensors, too. These sensors generate a huge amount of raw data. In order to extract knowledge and do predictive analysis, it is necessary that the raw sensor data be cleaned, understood, analyzed, and interpreted. Second challenge refers to predictive modeling. Traditional predictive models predict situations that are likely to happen in the near future by keeping and analyzing the history of past user’s situations. Traditional predictive analysis approaches have become less effective because of the massive amount of data continuously streamed in that both affects data processing efficiency and complicates the data semantics. To address the above challenges, we propose a data-driven, situation-aware framework for predictive analysis in smart environments. First, to effectively analyze the sensor data, we employ the Situ-Morphism method to transfer sensor-enabled situation information to vector information. Then we introduce new similarity metrics and implement similarity prediction based on Locality Sensitive Hashing to improve data processing efficiency and effectively handle the data semantics.

The latent representations of many aspects and the basis of human behaviour is naturally embedded within the expression of emotions found in human speech. This signifies the importance of mining audio data collected from human conversations for extracting human emotion. Ability to capture and represent human emotions will be an important feature in next-generation artificial intelligence, with the expectation of closer interaction with humans. Although the textual representations of human conversations have shown promising results for the extraction of emotions, the acoustic feature-based emotion detection from audio still lags behind in terms of accuracy.

Previous works have shown that authentication systems can be more effective when considering soft biometric traits such as the gender, while others highlighted the significance of this trait for enhancing UIs. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach to gender classification leveraging the only touch gestures information derived from smartphones’ APIs. To identify the most useful gesture and combination thereof for gender classification, we have considered two strategies: single-view learning, analyzing, one at a time, datasets relating to a single type of gesture, and multi-view learning, analyzing together datasets describing different types of gestures. This is one of the first works to apply such a strategy for gender recognition via gestures analysis on mobile devices. The methods have been evaluated on a large dataset of gestures collected through a mobile application, which includes not only scrolls, swipes, and taps but also pinch-to-zooms and drag-and-drops which are mostly overlooked in the literature. Conversely to the previous literature, we have also provided experiments of the solution in different scenarios, thus proposing a more comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results show that scroll down is the most useful gesture and random forest is the most convenient classifier for gender classification. Based on the (combination of) gestures taken into account, we have obtained F1-score up to 0.89 in validation and 0.85 in testing phase. Furthermore, the multi-view approach is recommended when dealing with unknown devices and combinations of gestures can be effectively adopted, building on the requirements of the system our solution is built-into.

It causes inflammation of the brain and, if left untreated, can have persistent effects on the central nervous system. Conspicuously, this paper proposes an intelligent cyber-physical healthcare framework based on the IoT–fog–cloud collaborative network, employing soft-computing technology and information fusion. The proposed framework uses IoT-based sensors, electronic medical records, and user devices for data acquisition. The fog layer, composed of numerous nodes, processes the most specific encephalitis symptom-related data to classify possible encephalitis cases in real time to issue an alarm when a significant health emergency occurs. Furthermore, the cloud layer involves a multi-step data processing scheme for in-depth data analysis. First, data obtained across multiple data generation sources are fused to obtain a more consistent, accurate, and reliable feature set. Data preprocessing and feature selection techniques are applied to the fused data for dimensionality reduction over the cloud computing platform. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is applied in the cloud to determine the risk of a disease and classify the results into one of four categories: no risk, probable risk, low risk, and acute risk. Moreover, the alerts are generated and sent to the stakeholders based on the risk factor. Finally, the computed results are stored in the cloud database for future use.

However, the environmental effects and sabotage of hostile people cause corrosion and decay of pipelines, which bring financial and environmental damages. Today, new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can provide solutions to monitor and timely detect corrosion of oil pipelines. Coverage is a fundamental challenge in pipeline monitoring systems to timely detect and resolve oil leakage and pipeline corrosion. To ensure appropriate coverage on pipeline monitoring systems, one solution is to design a scheduling mechanism for nodes to reduce energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based area coverage technique called CoWSN to intelligently monitor oil and gas pipelines. In CoWSN, the sensing range of each sensor node is converted to a digital matrix to estimate the overlap of this node with other neighboring nodes. Then, a Q-learning-based scheduling mechanism is designed to determine the activity time of sensor nodes based on their overlapping, energy, and distance to the base station. Finally, CoWSN can predict the death time of sensor nodes and replace them at the right time. This work does not allow to be disrupted the data transmission process between sensor nodes and BS. CoWSN is simulated using NS2. Then, our scheme is compared with three area coverage schemes, including the scheme of Rahmani et al., CCM-RL, and CCA according to several parameters, including the average number of active sensor nodes, coverage rate, energy consumption, and network lifetime. The simulation results show that CoWSN has a better performance than other methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12181-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These characteristics are presented in official government documentation distinguished by its heterogeneity. Ontologies in the domain of agriculture allow the organization and structuring of information to represent knowledge in such a way that the homogeneity of agricultural data dispersed in different types of documents such as manuals, weather reports, and official technical sheets is achieved. In accordance with the above, this work presents the development of an ontology in the agricultural domain to facilitate the identification of cultivation areas and improve land use, relating the basic concepts for an effective crop development according to the specifications and recommendations proposed in Colombian government documentation, using the Methontology methodology. This is achieved with the application of descriptive logic that, based on rules, generates inferences to identify the cultivation options and cultivable areas that present the highest performance. The interaction and use of the ontological model and inference rules are done through a web application made with Python and Flask. The precision of the model is evaluated using historical data of crops produced, making a comparison between the real data and the results obtained through the ontological model, obtaining as a result 80% reliability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11600-022-00808-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Augmented reality (AR) has been commonly applied to facilitate manual operations with ambient intelligence by overlaying virtual information on physical scenes. In most modern factories, maintenance remains an indispensable process that is difficult or yet to be fully automated. Several studies have previously reviewed AR-based maintenance across all industrial sectors, whereas those specific to manufacturing did not necessarily involve maintenance. Hence, this paper presents a systematic literature review on AR-assisted maintenance in manufacturing with a focus on the operator’s needs. A generic process has been proposed to classify the maintenance operations examined in the past studies into four sequential steps and to analyze the classification results based on the geographical location, maintenance type, AR technical elements, and integrated external sensors. The findings thus derived are expected to provide design guidelines for implementing AR applications with practical values to aid manual maintenance in future smart manufacturing environments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40684-022-00444-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The investigation constructs multiple risk forecasts that are synthesised in a new framework for counteracting risks from artificial intelligence (AI) itself. In other words, the research in this article is not just concerned with securing a system, but also analysing how the system responds when (internal and external) failure(s) and compromise(s) occur. This is an important methodological principle because not all systems can be secured, and totally securing a system is not feasible. Thus, we need to construct algorithms that will enable systems to continue operating even when parts of the system have been compromised. Furthermore, the article forecasts emerging cyber-risks from the integration of AI in cybersecurity. Based on the forecasts, the article is concentrated on creating synergies between the existing literature, the data sources identified in the survey, and forecasts. The forecasts are used to increase the feasibility of the overall research and enable the development of novel methodologies that uses AI to defend from cyber risks. The methodology is focused on addressing the risk of AI attacks, as well as to forecast the value of AI in defence and in the prevention of AI rogue devices acting independently.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12530-022-09431-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This article investigates the requirements necessary in order for AI to actually serve a public interest, and hence be socially good. The authors propose shifting the focus of the discourse towards democratic governance processes when developing and deploying AI systems. The article draws from the rich history of public interest theory in political philosophy and law, and develops a framework for ‘public interest AI’. The framework consists of (1) public justification for the AI system, (2) an emphasis on equality, (3) deliberation/ co-design process, (4) technical safeguards, and (5) openness to validation. This framework is then applied to two case studies, namely SyRI, the Dutch welfare fraud detection project, and UNICEF’s Project Connect, that maps schools worldwide.

In this paper, we focus on evolution of anomaly detection followed by survey of various methodologies developed to detect anomalies in intelligent video surveillance. Further, we revisit the surveys on anomaly detection in the last decade. We then present a systematic categorization of methodologies for anomaly detection. As the notion of anomaly depends on context, we identify different objects-of-interest and publicly available datasets in anomaly detection. Since anomaly detection is a time-critical application of computer vision, we explore the anomaly detection using edge devices and approaches explicitly designed for them.

This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI.

We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods.

When using controlling apps (e.g., a smartphone app), Duenna makes sure that only legitimate SHS users are allowed to operate their Internet of things (IoT) devices. Duenna is built upon a behavioral anomaly detection (BAD)-based approach. In particular, we hypothesize that SHS users usually operate their home IoT devices in typical and distinctive patterns. Therefore, users that attempt to operate devices differently from such a regular behavior are considered malicious. Technically, Duenna operates in two modes. In an initialization operation, Duenna first collects and processes the historical cyber and physical activities of an SHS user in addition to the historical states of the SHS itself to build a set of incremental anomaly detection (AD) models. Then, in an interactive operation, the trained AD models are, then, used as a baseline from which anomalous commands (i.e., outliers) are detected and rejected, while regular commands (i.e., targets) are considered legitimate and allowed to be executed. Through an empirical evaluation conducted on real-world data, Duenna exhibits high authentication rates ensuring both security and user experience.

In this paper, we extended and improved our previous approach for semi-automated model-based generation of executable test scripts. Our proposal is oriented to system-level acceptance testing of IoT systems. We have implemented a prototype tool taking in input a UML model of the system under test and some additional artefacts, and producing in output a test suite that checks if the system’s behaviour is compliant with such a model. We empirically evaluated our tool employing two IoT systems: a mobile health IoT system for diabetic patients and a smart park management system part of a smart city project. Both systems involve sensors or actuators, smartphones, and a remote cloud server. Results show that the test suites generated with our tool have been able to kill 91% of the overall 260 generated mutants (i.e. artificial bugged versions of the two considered systems).

In addition, network resources, such as bandwidth and node energy, are wasted by retransmissions. An accurate estimation of link quality will enable the network to better select the links used for data gathering. Hence, the number of retransmissions needed to achieve the required end-to-end reliability is decreased, leading to shorter end-to-end delivery times, a higher network throughput and an increased network lifetime. In this paper, different link quality estimators are reviewed with a more particular focus on those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). We propose to go even further than link quality estimation with link quality prediction. The expected benefit of using link quality prediction is to anticipate link breakages and route changes before loosing packets. It should result in a better QoE provided by the network. For that purpose, we evaluate the performance of four machine learning techniques (i.e. Linear Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) working on the traces collected from a real IoT network.

As a consequence, autonomous systems can exhibit unexpected and surprising behaviours. This is exacerbated due to the ubiquity and complexity of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems. This is the case of Reinforcement Learning (RL), where autonomous agents learn through trial-and-error how to find good solutions to a problem. Thus, the underlying decision-making criteria may become opaque to users that interact with the system and who may require explanations about the system’s reasoning. Available work for eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) offers different trade-offs: e.g. for runtime explanations, the approaches are model-specific or can only analyse results after-the-fact. Different from these approaches, this paper aims to provide an online model-agnostic approach for XRL towards trustworthy and understandable AI. We present ETeMoX, an architecture based on temporal models to keep track of the decision-making processes of RL systems. In cases where the resources are limited (e.g. storage capacity or time to response), the architecture also integrates complex event processing, an event-driven approach, for detecting matches to event patterns that need to be stored, instead of keeping the entire history. The approach is applied to a mobile communications case study that uses RL for its decision-making. In order to test the generalisability of our approach, three variants of the underlying RL algorithms are used: Q-Learning, SARSA and DQN. The encouraging results show that using the proposed configurable architecture, RL developers are able to obtain explanations about the evolution of a metric, relationships between metrics, and were able to track situations of interest happening over time windows.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10270-021-00952-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, relaying this data to the core cloud infrastructure may lead to a higher round trip delay. Thus, we utilize the cloud close to the ground, i.e., edge computing to realize an edge-envisioned IoD ecosystem. However, as this data is relayed over an open communication channel, it is often prone to different types of attacks due to it wider attack surface. Thus, we need to find a robust solution that can maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data while providing desired services. Blockchain technology is capable to handle these challenges owing to the distributed ledger that store the data immutably. However, the conventional block architecture pose several challenges because of limited computational capabilities of drones. As the size of blockchain increases, the data flow also increases and so does the associated challenges. Hence, to overcome these challenges, in this work, we have proposed a derived blockchain architecture that decouples the data part (or block ledger) from the block header and shifts it to off-chain storage. In our approach, the registration of a new drone is performed to enable legitimate access control thus ensuring identity management and traceability. Further, the interactions happen in the form of transactions of the blockchain. We propose a lightweight consensus mechanism based on the stochastic selection followed by a transaction signing process to ensure that each drone is in control of its block. The proposed scheme also handles the expanding storage requirements with the help of data compression using a shrinking block mechanism. Lastly, the problem of additional delay anticipated due to drone mobility is handled using a multi-level caching mechanism. The proposed work has been validated in a simulated Gazebo environment and the results are promising in terms of different metrics. We have also provided numerical validations in context of complexity, communication overheads and computation costs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03497-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Successful GIS applications and practices in local police departments are also introduced in this paper. At the end of this paper, three problems and challenges faced in the development of PGIS are introduced, involving the current PGIS application depth; the support of crime mapping and crime analysis theoretical research on policing practices; and the introduction and localization of mature foreign crime analysis and prediction technology. Additionally, we point out that the implementation of smart policing strategies under the context of big data has created favorable conditions for subsequent crime analysis, research, and application, encouraging police departments to more frequently take initiative by cooperating with research institutions in crime analysis and prediction technology research.

Routing and security are current issues in MANETs. Security is highly important in MANET and cloud environments for preventing harmful attacks. Therefore, a trusted environment is required for a MANET with cloud-based 5G communications. In this paper, we propose a new framework called trust-aware intrusion detection and prevention system (TA-IDPS) for protecting the network from adversaries. TA-IDPS consists of a MANET, a cloudlet, and a cloud service layer. Initially, we register and authenticate mobile nodes using an ultra-lightweight symmetric cryptographic technique, which is highly suitable for resource-constrained environments. In MANETs, high energy consumption, scalability, and authentication are important issues, which are addressed by the proposed moth flame optimization algorithm. If the cluster head (CH) receives data packets from a source node, they are classified as normal, malicious, and suspicious using a deep belief network. Intra-cluster routing is implemented by an adaptive Bayesian estimator using next-best forwarder selection. In the cloudlet layer, cloudlets are used to aggregate packets from the CH and verify their legitimacy so that they can be forwarded to the cloud service layer. Each cloudlet is provided with a peek monitor for classifying suspicious packets as malicious and normal using Awads information entropy. Experiments are conducted using NS3.26. The performance of the proposed TA-IDPS and previous methods is analyzed using widely used metrics. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed TA-IDPS system outperformed the previous methods in terms of all metrics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10207-020-00531-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In VANETs, vehicles act as nodes connected with each other and sometimes with a public station. Vehicles continuously exchange and collect information to provide innovative transportation services; for example, traffic management, navigation, autonomous driving, and the generation of alerts. However, VANETs are extremely challenging for data collection, due to their high mobility and dynamic network topologies that cause frequent link disruptions and make path discovery difficult. In this survey, various state-of-the-art data collection protocols for VANETs are discussed, based on three broad categories, i.e., delay-tolerant, best-effort, and real-time protocols. A taxonomy is designed for data collection protocols for VANETs that is essential to add precision and ease of understandability. A detailed comparative analysis among various data collection protocols is provided to highlight their functionalities and features. Protocols are evaluated based on three parametric phases. First, protocols investigation based on six necessary parameters, including delivery and drop ratio, efficiency, and recovery strategy. Second, a 4-D functional framework is designed to fit most data collection protocols for quick classification and mobility model identification, thus eradicating the need to read extensive literature. In the last, in-depth categorical mapping is performed to deep dive for better and targeted interpretation. In addition, some open research challenges for ITS and VANETs are discussed to highlight research gaps.

However, although utilizing edge intelligence contributes to providing smart systems such as automated driving systems, smart cities, and connected healthcare systems, it is not free from limitations. There exist various challenges in integrating AI and edge computing, one of which is addressed in this paper. Our main focus is to handle the adoption of AI methods on resource-constrained edge devices. In this regard, we introduce the concept of Edge devices as a Service (EdaaS) and propose a quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE)-aware dynamic and reliable framework for AI subtasks composition. The proposed framework is evaluated utilizing three well-known meta-heuristics in terms of various metrics for a connected healthcare application scenario. The experimental results confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the results reveal that black widow optimization (BWO) can handle the issue more efficiently compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA).

Especially, detecting violence in crowded scenes is challenging because of the rapid movement, overlapping features due to occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. This paper plans to implement the enhanced model for video violence detection with the aid of intelligent approaches. The proposed model covers different phases like (a) pre-processing, (b) feature extraction, (c) optimal feature selection, and (d) classification. Initially, the video frames are split, and the pre-processing of the frames is carried out by the Gaussian filter. Next, the feature extraction procedure is undergone, in which the Motion Boundary Scale Invariant Feature Transform (MoBSIFT), Histogram of oriented Gradients (HoG), and Motion Weber Local Descriptor (MoWLD) are used. Further, the optimal feature selection is adopted. The hybridization of two well-performing algorithms like Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO), and Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (GOA), namely Spider Monkey-Grasshopper Optimization algorithm (SM-GOA) is used for optimal feature selection with the intention of solving a multi-objective function. Then, the classification of violence and non-violence video frames is done by the Deep Neural Network (DNN), in which the training algorithm is enhanced by the same SM-GOA. The proposed SM-GOA-based DNN had achieved less False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), and False Detection Rate (FDR) values compared to the existing methods proving less variance to the negative performance and thus has shown good overall performance on the violence flow dataset.

The expansion of IoT technology has gained the attention of hackers to acquire the benefits of their communication abilities for performing various kinds of attacks. The main issue is devices of IoT pose various susceptibilities which simply exploit the IoT botnets. This paper devises an optimization-aware deep model for detecting and mitigating attacks in IoT. Here, the first step is a simulation of IoT nodes. In addition, the authentication with privacy preserved data encryption is performed with autoregressive poor and rich optimization (APRO) algorithm. Thereafter, the feature selection is performed with Jaro–Winkler distance for obtaining imperative features. After determining the optimum features, the attack detection is performed with autoregressive poor and rich spider monkey optimization-based deep Q network (APRSMO-based deep Q network). Here, the deep Q network training is done with developed APRSMO, which is devised by combining conditional autoregressive value at risk by regression quantiles (CAViaR), and poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm, and spider monkey optimization (SMO). The mitigation of attack is performed using data rates if the output generated by the proposed APRSMO-based deep Q network is an intruder.

Along with the advancement of technology nowadays, the volume of text has grown to be larger and larger. To extract useful information from this amount of text becomes an exceptionally complex task. As an effort to solve that problem, in this paper, we present a pipeline to extract core knowledge from large quantity text using distributed computing. The components of our pipeline are systems that were known to yield good results. The outputs of our proposed system are stored in a knowledge graph. A knowledge graph is a graph for storing knowledge in the form of triples (head, relation, tail). Some of the existing knowledge graphs in the world are Google knowledge graph, YAGO, DBLP, or DBpedia. These knowledge graphs have one thing in common—they are in English. The English language is studied by many researchers in the world and it had become a rich-resource language (with many natural language processing tools and data set). Vietnamese, on the other hand, is a low-resource language. Therefore, we use cross-lingual transfer method to build a Vietnamese knowledge graph. Firstly, we collect data in form of text about Vietnam tourism, which was written mostly in Vietnamese, using Google search and Wikipedia. In the next step, we translate them into English with Google Translate and use English Natural Language Processing tools like Stanford Parser, Co-referencing, ClausIE, MinIE to extract useful triples from this text. Lastly, the triples are translated back to Vietnamese to build a Vietnam tourism knowledge graph. Since we are working with massive text, we develop a distributed algorithm to extract triples from sentences of massive text. This is a distributed version of MinIE, which was originally developed for a single machine model. In Apache Spark framework, we divide massive text into many smaller parts and move them to the worker nodes with distributed MinIE function. Spark distributed MinIE will extract the triples of sentences in the local text of this worker node in parallel. Finally, the result of worker nodes will be sent back to the master node for building the knowledge graph. We conduct experiments with the distributed MinIE on spark cluster to prove the outperformance of our proposed algorithm.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05495-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, disparate types of users coexist in such scenarios, which can make the heterogeneous network unfair in terms of allocation of resources to various users based on their requirements. Therefore, a mechanism is required for effective spectrum sharing and to achieve overall system fairness. In this paper, an analytical model is suggested, which is based on a two-dimensional Markov state-transition diagram, to help set the parameter values to control the issuance of resources in coexistence layouts. A restriction approach is further implemented to gain a fair balance of the Grade-of-Service (GoS) for both user groups using the User Admission Control (UAC) mechanism. The developed mechanism restricts access to various channel resources for users with complete choice to give a greater probability of access to different users with limited resource options. Various levels of restriction are investigated in order to offer a balanced low-blocking probability performance to both user groups in order to improve the overall network fairness. Also, the proposed approach could provide a precise level of Grade-of-Service guarantee for both the user groups if sufficient flexibility is available within the whole network. Our simulations results along with the analytical model demonstrate that approximately 30% to 45% enhancement, in terms of grade of service (GoS), could be achieved in high to medium loads by restricting some of the users’ flexibility. From the analytical model, it is concluded that the blocking of shadowed users are significantly reduced from 7% to 4.5% at high traffic loads. Moreover, the obtained results and findings are verified using a number of case studies and large-scale simulations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11235-022-00893-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With the explosion of IoT data, anomaly detection on data streams raises higher requirements for real-time response and strong robustness on large-scale data arriving at the same time and various application fields. However, existing methods are either slow or application-specific. Inspired by the edge computing and generic anomaly detection technique, we propose an isolation forest based framework with dynamic Insertion and Deletion schemes (IDForest), which can incrementally update the forest to detect anomalies on data streams. Besides, IDForest is deployed on edge servers in parallel through packing each tree into a subtask, which facilitates the fast anomaly detection on data streams.

In order to ensure the security and integrity for the users, organisations and researchers aim to develop robust filters for spam email detection. Recently, most spam filters based on machine learning algorithms published in academic journals report very high performance, but users are still reporting a rising number of frauds and attacks via spam emails. Two main challenges can be found in this field: (a) it is a very dynamic environment prone to the dataset shift problem and (b) it suffers from the presence of an adversarial figure, i.e. the spammer. Unlike classical spam email reviews, this one is particularly focused on the problems that this constantly changing environment poses. Moreover, we analyse the different spammer strategies used for contaminating the emails, and we review the state-of-the-art techniques to develop filters based on machine learning. Finally, we empirically evaluate and present the consequences of ignoring the matter of dataset shift in this practical field.

We mathematically modeled the cost-effective performance optimization problem in robust edge-cloud application systems and proved the convexity of the approximated problem so that they can be solved in tractable ways with existing solvers to generate the resource allocation strategies.

To address this issue, we propose a cheap and robust River Flooding Detection System, which can be easily deployed in any river with a flat surface at its bedside. The novelty of our system is the use of raw images from off-the-shelf cameras with no preprocessing required. Hence, our methodology can be deployed using existing surveillance cameras in urban environments. The proposed system measures the river level by first performing a semantic segmentation of the river water blade using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Then, it uses Computer Vision (CV) to estimate the water level. If the water level is near or above a dangerous threshold, it sends alerts automatically without human intervention. Moreover, our system can successfully measure a river’s water level with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.32 cm, which is enough to detect when a river is about to overflow. The system is also reliable in measuring a river’s water level from different camera viewpoints and lighting conditions.

In this article I will engage with this new technology, and with the debates and literature that surround it. Working at the intersection of criminology, policing, surveillance and the study of emotional AI this paper explores and offers a framework of understanding the various issues that these technologies present particularly to liberal democracies. I argue that these technologies should not be deployed within public spaces because there is only a very weak evidence-base as to their effectiveness in a policing and security context, and even more importantly represent a major intrusion to people’s private lives and also represent a worrying extension of policing power because of the possibility that intentions and attitudes may be inferred. Further to this, the danger in the use of such invasive surveillance for the purpose of policing and crime prevention in urban spaces is that it potentially leads to a highly regulated and control-oriented society. I argue that emotion recognition has severe impacts on the right to the city by not only undertaking surveillance of existing situations but also making inferences and probabilistic predictions about future events as well as emotions and intentions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-022-01435-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the first phase, multi-objective non-dominated sorting with whale optimization approach (MNSWOA) and ideal point method (IPM) is implemented for feature selection.

Therefore, the information received from the sensors must be reliable. If the sensors present any anomalies, serious problems can arise, such as publishing wrong theories in scientific papers, or causing production delays in industry. One of the most common anomalies are uncalibrations. An uncalibration occurs when the sensor is not adjusted or standardized by calibration according to a ground truth value. In this work, an online machine-learning based uncalibration detector for temperature, humidity and pressure sensors is presented. This development integrates an artificial neural network as the main component which learns from the behavior of the sensors under calibrated conditions. Then, after being trained and deployed, it detects uncalibrations once they take place. The obtained results show that the proposed system is able to detect the 100% of the presented uncalibration events, although the time response in the detection depends on the resolution of the model for the specific location, i.e., the minimum statistically significant variation in the sensor behavior that the system is able to detect. This architecture can be adapted to different contexts by applying transfer learning, such as adding new sensors or having different environments by re-training the model with minimum amount of data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06865-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most of the services like smart meters, indoor navigation, lighting control, etc., which contribute to smart buildings, need the locations of people or objects within the building. This gave rise to Indoor Localization, where only the infrastructure of the building has to be used for localization as accessing the Global Positioning System is difficult in indoor environments. Many approaches have been proposed to predict locations based on the infrastructure available indoors, and some of such techniques use Wi-Fi access points. Still, unfortunately, very few studies have concentrated on tolerating faults while being cost-effective. This work discusses hardware implementation of indoor localization. It then proposes a learning algorithm SRNN (Speed Conscious Recurrent Neural Network) that uses the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values of available Wi-Fi access points in the building and predicts the location. Also, fault-tolerant approaches termed nearest RSSI and the most recent RSSI using Kullback–Leibler Divergence have been proposed to improve the location accuracy when access points go down and are prone to faults. Both the proposed approaches nearest RSSI and most recent RSSI along with SRNN improve the location accuracy by 4% and 2.1%, respectively, over existing techniques and contribute to optimizing predicted location's accuracy in Indoor Localization an IoT service for smart buildings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-022-01301-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It focuses on current research trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research. Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified, which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective operation and management strategies of buildings and districts. Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and thus more effectively promotes a “cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation” environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable environmental assessments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-022-02058-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The core of management lies in the precise prediction of daily volumes of sewage. The generation of sewage is the result of multiple factors from the whole social system. Characterized by strong process abstraction ability, data mining techniques have been viewed as promising prediction methods to realize intelligent STP management. However, existing data mining-based methods for this purpose just focus on a single factor such as an economical or meteorological factor and ignore their collaborative effects. To address this challenge, a deep learning-based intelligent management mechanism for STPs is proposed, to predict business volume. Specifically, the grey relation algorithm (GRA) and gated recursive unit network (GRU) are combined into a prediction model (GRA-GRU). The GRA is utilized to select the factors that have a significant impact on the sewage business volume, and the GRU is set up to output the prediction results. We conducted a large number of experiments to verify the efficiency of the proposed GRA-GRU model. 污水处理厂的智能化管理对于未来智慧城市的可持续发展至关重要,这项管理工作的核心之一在于对每日污水业务量的准确预测。从系统科学的角度而言,污水的产生是整个社会系统多种因素共同作用的结果。数据挖掘技术具有很强的抽象能力,能够用来构建实现污水处理厂智能化管理的预测方法。然而,现有的基于数据挖掘的方法只关注单一因素,如经济或气象因素,而忽略了它们的协同效应。针对这一挑战,本文提出了一种基于深度学习的污水厂智能化管理机制来预测污水业务量。将灰色关联算法(GRA)和门控递归单元网络(GRU)结合成预测模型(GRA-GRU)。利用GRA选择对污水业务量有显著影响的因素,利用GRU输出预测结果。本文进行了大量的实验来验证所提出的GRA-GRU模型的有效性。",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11771-022-5036-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, it has had many drawbacks on people’s health and the environment. Several paradigms have been proposed and implemented in an effort to suppress and reverse the adverse impacts of human activities and industrialization. A popular approach that serves as a solution to many of the negative implications of industry today is the circular economy (CE). With today’s top-notch technologies, the transition from the conventional linear economy to CE has been made easier. For example, the implementation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), an Industry 4.0 (I4.0) tool, within a CE can substantially increase efficiency and reduce waste. This work presents a thorough review on the applications of cyber-physical systems within each of the CE stages, the contribution of different CPS technologies to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and the current state of the CE assessment tools. The contribution of different CPS tools to each CE stage is demonstrated through several practical examples. In addition, this work reveals how the different CPS technologies applications contribute to the attainment of different SDGs set by the United Nations.

Adulteration is not just a crucial economic problem, but it may also lead to serious health problems for consumers. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a world-class spice commonly contaminated with various chemicals and colors. It has also been used extensively in many Asian curries, sauces, and medications. Different traditional approaches, such as chemical and physical methods, are available for detecting adulterants in turmeric. These approaches are rather time-consuming and inaccurate methods. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify the adulterants in turmeric accurately and instantly. A cloud-based system was developed to detect adulteration in adulterated turmeric. The dataset consists of spectral images of turmeric with tartrazine-colored rice flour adulterant. Adulterants in weight percentages of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% were mixed with turmeric. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented to detect adulteration, which achieved 100% accuracy for training and 94.35% accuracy for validation. The deep CNN (DCNN) models, namely, VGG16, DenseNet201, and MobileNet, were implemented to detect adulteration. The proposed CNN model outperforms DCNN models in terms of accuracy and layers. The CNN model is deployed to the platform as a service (PaaS) cloud. The deployed model link can be accessed using a smartphone.

In addition, it can be used for energy-aware routing, i.e., the driver can be provided with information that on which route less energy consumption will take place. In this paper, an integrated system has been proposed which can provide reliable and real-time estimate of the energy consumption for an EV. The approach uses Deep Auto-Encoders (DAE), cross-connected using latent space mapping, which consider historical traffic speed to predict the traffic speed at multiple time steps in future. The predicted traffic speed is used to calculate the future vehicle speed. The vehicle speed, acceleration along with wind speed, road elevation, temperature, battery’s SOC, and auxiliary loads are used as input to a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the energy consumption. The prediction is further fine-tuned using a Bagged Decision Tree (BDT).

Processing generated data from IoT devices and actuation warranted in real-time requires computational infrastructure near the edge to get the outcome without delay. Emerging edge technologies such as Fog computing, Multi-Access Edge Computing, and Cloudlet provide computing resources near the edge, i.e. closer to the IoT devices, where devices can place their services/applications or offload their computational job for processing. The utilization of computing resources provided by emerging edge technologies addresses the issue of delay in the outcome and increases the battery life of IoT devices/End-user devices. Computational resources provided by the edge technologies, i.e. edge/fog nodes, can be heterogeneous, dynamic and mobile. Therefore, service placement and computation offloading on edge/fog nodes are challenging issues, and the problem to finding the best suitable fog/edge nodes is NP-Hard. Nature-inspired algorithms provide robust solutions to NP-Hard problems.

Smart vehicles understand the environment through multi-sensor, network, and pervasive systems for gaining useful information. The problem arises with the absence of useful information in explicit scenarios where heterogeneous information becomes mandatory. This article aims to improve transportation support's effectiveness using a discrete behavior information fusion (DBIF) based on the deep learning technique by considering the contradiction in information availability. This proposed technique observes the vehicles' behavior and response to the scene throughout the route displacement. The deep learning model achieves greater accuracy in target detection and classification. The learning output is the independent fusion of behavior (response output) and information (sensed). This sensed information is useful in categorizing further deviations and stipulations for the progressive displacements. The stipulated information and its deviations are recurrently categorized using support vector machine learning. The information provides accurate positioning and tracking of smart vehicles by reducing approximation errors and complexity. The simulation results illustrate the proposed technique's efficiency by improving the accuracy of 92.078% and fusion rate of 0.9741 and reducing error of 0.0662, complexity of 0.0717, and fusion time of 0.9938 compared to existing methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-021-04115-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

HAR has been extensively studied using different paradigms, such as different reasoning mechanisms, including probabilistic, rule-based, statistical, logical reasoning, or the machine learning (ML) paradigm, to construct inference models to recognize or predict user activities. ML for HAR allows that activities can be recognized and even anticipated through the analysis of collected data from different sensors, with greater accuracy than the other paradigms. On the other hand, context-aware middlewares (CAMs) can efficiently integrate a large number of different devices and sensors. Moreover, they provide a programmable and auto-configurable infrastructure for streamline the design and construction of software solutions in scenarios where lots of sensors and data are their bases, such as ambient intelligence, smart cities, and e-health domains. In this way, the full integration of ML capabilities as services in CAMs can advance the development of software solutions in these domains when ML is necessary, specially for HAR, which is the basis for many scenarios in these domains. In this work, we present a survey for identifying the state-of-the-art in using ML for HAR in CAMs through a systematic literature review (SLR). In our SLR, we worked to answer four research questions: (i) what are the different types of context reasoners available in CAMs; (ii) what are the ML algorithms and methods used for generating models for context reasoning; (iii) which CAMs support data processing in real time; and (iv) what are the HAR scenarios usually tackled by the research works. In our analysis, we observed that, although ML offers viable approaches to construct inference models for HAR using different ML approaches, including batch learning, adaptive learning and data stream learning, there are yet some gaps and research challenges to be tackled, specially on the use of data stream learning considering concept drift on data, mechanisms for adapting the inference models, and further considering all of this as services in CAMs, specially for HAR.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10462-021-10094-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For these tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the dominant solution for the past decade, for their remarkable ability in learning discriminative features from images to boost retrieval performance. However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems. To demonstrate the potential of such threats, this paper proposes a novel adversarial patch generative adversarial network (AP-GAN) to generate adversarial patches instead of modifying the entire image, which also causes the DNNs-based image retrieval models to return incorrect results. AP-GAN is trained in an unsupervised way that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. Extensive experiments show that the AP-GAN achieves excellent attacking performance with various application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image retrieval, person ReID and vehicle ReID. The results of this study provide a warning that when deploying a DNNs-based image retrieval system, its security and robustness needs to be thoroughly considered.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10707-020-00418-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Because cloud computing is on-demand, efficient use of resources such as memory, processors, bandwidth, etc., is a big challenge. Despite the advantages of cloud computing, sometimes it is not a proper choice due to its delay in responding appropriately to existing requests, which led to the need for another technology called fog computing. Fog computing reduces traffic and time lags by expanding cloud services to the network and closer to users. It can schedule resources with higher efficiency and utilize them to impact the user's experience dramatically. This paper aims to survey some studies that have been done in the field of scheduling in fog/cloud computing environments. The focus of this survey is on published studies between 2015 and 2021 in journals or conferences.

We classified these studies into five categories based on their traced parameters and their focus area. This classification comprises 1—performance 2—energy efficiency, 3—resource utilization, 4—performance and energy efficiency, and 5—performance and resource utilization simultaneously. 42.3% of the studies focused on performance, 9.9% on energy efficiency, 7.0% on resource utilization, 21.1% on both performance and energy efficiency, and 19.7% on both performance and resource utilization.

However, these solutions are mostly prototypes and remain unused in real-life scenarios. In this work, we review the historical and current landscape of the field, to try and understand why robots have yet to succeed as personal assistants in daily life. Our analysis focuses on two complementary aspects: the capabilities of the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. The former analysis shows regularities in hardware configurations and functionalities, leading to the definition of a set of six application-level capabilities ( exploration , identification , remote control , communication , manipulation , and digital situatedness ). The latter focuses on the impact of robots on the daily life of users and categorises the deployment of robots for healthcare interventions using three types of services: support , mitigation , and response . Our investigation reveals that the value of healthcare interventions is limited by a stagnation of functionalities and a disconnection between the robotic platform and the design of the intervention. To address this issue, we propose a novel co-design toolkit, which uses an ecological framework for robot interventions in the healthcare domain. Our approach connects robot capabilities with known geriatric factors, to create a holistic view encompassing both the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. As a case study-based validation, we discuss the use of the toolkit in the pre-design of the robotic platform for an pilot intervention, part of the EU large-scale pilot of the EU H2020 GATEKEEPER project.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00816-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Task scheduling algorithm should determine a sequence of execution of tasks to meet the requirements of the user in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) factors (e.g., execution time and cost). The key issue in recent task scheduling is energy efficiency since it reduces cost and satisfies the standard parameter in green computing. The most important aim of this paper is a comparative analysis of 67 scheduling methods in the cloud system to minimize energy consumption during task scheduling. This work allows the reader to choose the right scheduling algorithm that optimizes energy properly, given the existing problems and limitations.

The results illustrate that both cost efficiencies and new revenue streams can be realised, as the insurance business model will shift from loss compensation to loss prediction and prevention. Moreover, we identify two possible developments with respect to the insurability of risks. The first is that the application of artificial intelligence by insurance companies might allow for a more accurate prediction of loss probabilities, thus reducing one of the industry’s most inherent problems, namely asymmetric information. The second development is that artificial intelligence might change the risk landscape significantly by transforming some risks from low-severity/high-frequency to high-severity/low-frequency.

We consider in this paper a federated learning scenario wherein the local training is carried out on IoT devices and the global aggregation is done at the level of an edge server. One essential challenge in this emerging approach is IoT devices selection (also called scheduling), i.e., how to select the IoT devices to participate in the distributed training process. The existing approaches suggest to base the scheduling decision on the resource characteristics of the devices to guarantee that the selected devices would have enough resources to carry out the training. In this work, we argue that trust should be an integral part of the decision-making process and therefore design a trust establishment mechanism between the edge server and IoT devices. The trust mechanism aims to detect those IoT devices that over-utilize or under-utilize their resources during the local training. Thereafter, we introduce DDQN-Trust, a double deep Q learning-based selection algorithm that takes into account the trust scores and energy levels of the IoT devices to make appropriate scheduling decisions. Finally, we integrate our solution into four federated learning aggregation approaches, namely, FedAvg , FedProx , FedShare and FedSGD . Experiments conducted using a real-world dataset show that our DDQN-Trust solution always achieves better performance compared to two main benchmarks: the DQN and random scheduling algorithms. The results also reveal that FedProx outperforms the competitor aggregation models in terms of accuracy when integrated into our DDQN-Trust solution.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-022-01078-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The ultimate goal is to eliminate the latency we face when relying on Cloud to perform the desired processing activities. In EC, any processing is performed over a number of geo-distributed datasets formulated by the collected data that exhibit specific statistical characteristics. Processing can have the form of tasks requested by end users or applications. It becomes obvious that in the EC ecosystem, we have to carefully decide the EC nodes that will host and execute any requested task.

In this work, we design an interference-aware workload scheduling approach to execute latency-sensitive tasks in the cloud system.

However, the recognition rate of the current face recognition technology is still faulty. In particular, face recognition may not work correctly due to various causes such as CCTV shot quality, weather, personal pose and facial expression, hairstyle, lighting condition, and so on. In this case, there is a great risk of exposing an object’s privacy information in the video surveillance environment due to erroneous object judgment. This paper proposes a video surveillance-based access control technique that combines a facial recognition system using CCTV machine learning with radio-frequency identification (RFID). The proposed method is implemented when accurate facial recognition is difficult to achieve due to poor video quality or low levels of similarity against feature vectors, in which cases multi-channel authentication is performed with the use of RFID features available on a mobile device in possession of the individual. The dual-channel authentication approach can still help identify the entity and protect his or her privacy with greater security even if the RFID tags for authentication are breached or accurate facial detection becomes challenging due to various factors such as CCTV video quality deterioration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-019-01299-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These approaches are classified into four main categories: exact approaches, heuristic approaches, meta-heuristic approaches, and hybrid approaches. For each category, a critical analysis is drawn according to targeted objectives, considered constraints, type of positioned nodes (Mesh Router and Mesh Gateway), location (discrete or continuous), and environment (static or dynamic).

Recent studies tend to utilize dynamic graph neural networks to capture spatial-temporal correlations. However, urban traffic faces spatial heterogeneity of different lane structure at intersections, leading to different traffic patterns of lanes in different directions. It also confronts temporal heterogeneity of varying traffic trends in different time periods. Unfortunately, the influence of such spatial-temporal heterogeneity on traffic evolution are not fully considered in existing methods. To this end, this paper proposes a novel dynamic-graph-based model called HA-STGN, which integrates these heterogeneous features into spatial-learning components to model traffic networks in a finer granularity. Specifically, we design a dynamic graph model, which performs on a direction-aware road network to extract the structural information of intersections. Then, a time-sensitive attention mechanism is proposed to perceive the effect of time by introducing explicit temporal features. Moreover, an adaptive fusion module is provided to balance the spatial-temporal information adaptively. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our model. The results show that our proposed HA-STGN can effectively capture spatial-temporal dependencies and outperform all the baseline methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-022-01045-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We conduct a practice-based design research study in which we prototype and evaluate a transparent smart electric vehicle charge point, and investigate experts’ and citizens’ understanding of AI transparency. We find that citizens experience transparency as burdensome; experts hope transparency ensures acceptance, while citizens are mostly indifferent to AI; and with absent means of control, citizens question transparency’s relevance.

However, a considerable amount of data must be elaborated and managed in such an application. This paper proposes a set of machine learning (ML) tools to detect anomalies in a bridge from vibrational measurements using the minimum amount of data. The proposed framework starts from the fundamental frequencies extracted through operational modal analysis (OMA) and clustering, followed by a density-based time-domain tracking algorithm. The fundamental frequencies extracted are then fed to one-class classification (OCC) algorithms that perform anomaly detection. Then, to reduce the amount of data, we analyze the effect of the number of sensors, the number of bits per sample, the observation time, and the measurement noise on damage detection performance. As a case study, the Z-24 bridge is considered because of the extensive database of accelerometric measurements in both standard and damaged conditions. A comparison of OCC algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and one-class classifier neural network (OCCNN) $$^2$$ 2 is performed, and their robustness to data shrinking is evaluated.

Instinct influences the behaviour of fish to group into schools to increase safety, enhance foraging success, and promote breeding. According to these instinctive behaviours, several fish-inspired algorithms have been introduced to solve hard problems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of fish-inspired heuristics, exploring their evolution within the context of general optimization problems. To our knowledge, this survey is the first to cover both main fish-inspired heuristics in the literature, namely, the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and Fish school search (FSS), in addition to other algorithms inspired by specific fish species. The review covers more than 50 papers published in the Web of Science and IEEE databases since 2000. We first review the basic fish heuristics, highlighting their advantages and drawbacks, and then detail attempts in the literature to improve their behaviour to solve complex, multi-objective and high-dimensional problems in several domains. Our work is intended to provide guidance for researchers and practitioners for the purpose of further advancing research in the area of fish-inspired heuristics. We aspire to encourage their utilization in various fields for global optimization and in real-life applications. The survey findings indicate that fish-inspired heuristics are very alive in recent literature and still have great potential. Several challenges and future research directions are also identified among the findings of this survey, which can help to enhance this vibrant line of research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11831-022-09711-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One simple click-on end device can make every tool accessible to users; however, whether correct information is received remains to be an open question. Incorrect information that bundles the factors of fake, malicious, or fraudulent information, whether deliberately or not, may worsen misunderstandings. To avoid these cases escalating to the level of crime, a universal financial fraud-awareness model was designed in this study. The model first targets accurate fraud detection and classification using the natural language processing technique. An anti-fraud chatbot is then implemented as an instance of the model and deployed on a widely used social network service, namely LINE. This implementation aims to manage finance-fraud cases and provide anti-fraud suggestions to deal with foreseeable fraud events. Statistics of the comparison between Word2vec, ELMO, BERT, and DistilBERT on the five-strong conventional machine-learning models and the models of artificial neural networks indicate that the proposed model can achieve an accuracy of over 98% while detecting potential finance-fraud cases.

Despite its benefits, a key challenge in MCS is how beneficially select a minimum subset of participants from the large user pool to achieve the desired level of coverage. In this paper, we propose several algorithms to choose a minimum number of mobile users(or participants) who met the desired level of coverage. We consider two different cases, in the first case, only a single participant is allowed to upload a data packet for a particular target, whereas for the other case, two participants are allowed to do the same (provided that the target is covered by more than one participants). An optimal solution to the problem can be found by solving integer linear programmings (ILP’s). However, due to the exponential complexity of the ILP problem, for the large input size, it is infeasible from the point of execution time as well as the requirement of having the necessary information about all the participants in a central location. We also propose a distributed participant selection algorithm considering both the cases, which are dynamic in nature and run at every user. Each user exchanges their message with the neighbors to decide whether to remain idle or active. A series of experiments are executed to measure the performance of the proposed algorithms. Simulation results reveal the proximity of the proposed distributed algorithm compared to the optimal result providing the same coverage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00542-022-05271-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fog computing is an emerging technology that aims to overcome the common challenges, such as delay, bandwidth usage, and security, by bringing the process and the storage closer to the user. Services that should serve IoT nodes usually have complex multi-component structures. Thus, mapping such structures onto the dynamic and complex fog environment is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Fog Service Placement algorithm based on Complex Networks feature (FSPCN) by considering the community concept to overcome this issue. Previous research commonly formed communities solely based on the network structure. We argue that grouping fog nodes into balanced communities before service placement, based on the network structure and nodes and links attributes, can lead to more effective placement of IoT services concerning resource use and application delay. In addition, we have defined a neighborhood distance metric, calculated based on the number of common neighbors among communities, to prioritize communities. This improves the average number of hops from requesting nodes to the requested services and reduces delay and traffic within the network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of resource use and response time. Thus, the FSPCN method deploys more applications in the fog environment and decreases up to 17% the number of applications placed in the cloud. This method also reduces the average delay about 30%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-022-03571-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper addresses some epistemological issues posed by AR systems. I focus on a near-future version of AR technology called the Real-World Web, which promises to radically transform the nature of our relationship to digital information by mixing the virtual with the physical. I argue that the Real-World Web (RWW) threatens to exacerbate three existing epistemic problems in the digital age: the problem of digital distraction, the problem of digital deception, and the problem of digital divergence. The RWW is poised to present new versions of these problems in the form of what I call the augmented attention economy, augmented skepticism, and the problem of other augmented minds. The paper draws on a range of empirical research on AR and offers a phenomenological analysis of virtual objects as perceptual affordances to help ground and guide the speculative nature of the discussion.

Therefore, the comprehensive testing of IoT technology has attracted the attention of many researchers, which promotes the extensive development of IoT testing methods and infrastructure. However, the current research on IoT testing methods and testbeds mainly focuses on specific application scenarios, lacking systematic review and analysis of many applications from different points of view. This paper systematically summarizes the latest testing methods covering different IoT fields and discusses the development status of the existing Internet of things testbed. Findings of this review demonstrate that IoT testing is moving toward larger scale and intelligent testing, and that in near future, IoT test architecture is set to become more standardized and universally applicable with multi-technology convergence—i.e., a combination of big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence—being the prime focus of IoT testing.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-09124-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To facilitate this, there has been an extensive focus on exploring the capability of new technologies with limited success. This paper investigates whether MS Kinect (a motion-based sensing 3-D scanner device) within the MiiHome (My Intelligent Home) project in conjunction with other sensory data, machine learning and big data techniques can assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive impairment and hence prolong independent living. A pool of Kinect devices and various sensors powered by minicomputers providing internet connectivity are being installed in up to 200 homes. This enables continuous remote monitoring of elderly residents living alone. Passive and off-the-shelf sensor technologies were chosen to implement data acquisition specifically from sources that are part of the fabric of the homes, so that no extra effort is required from the participants. Various constraints including environmental, geometrical and big data were identified and appropriately dealt with. A visualization tool (MAGID) was developed for validation and verification of numerous behavioural activities. Then, a subset of data, from twelve pensioners aged over 65 with age-related cognitive decline and frailty, were collected over a period of 6 months. These data were subjected to several machine learning algorithms (multilayer perceptron neural network, neuro-fuzzy and deep learning) for classification and to extract routine behavioural patterns. These patterns were then analysed further to ascertain any health-related information and their attributes. For the first time, important routine behaviour related to Activities of Daily Living (ADL) of elderly people with cognitive and physical decline has been learnt by machine learning techniques from selected sample data obtained by MS Kinect. Medically important behaviour, e.g. eating, walking, sitting, was best learnt by deep learning with accuracy of 99.30% during training stage and average error rate of 1.83% with maximum of 12.98% during the implementation phase. Observations obtained from the application of the above learnt behaviours are presented as trends over a period of time. These trends, supplemented by other sensory signals, have provided a clearer picture of physical (in)activities (including falls) of the pensioners. The calculated behavioural attributes related to key indicators of health events can be used to model the trajectory of health status related to cognitive decline in a home setting. These results, based on a small number of elderly residents over a short period of time, imply that within the results obtained from the MiiHome project, it is possible to find indicators of cognitive decline. However, further studies are needed for full clinical validation of these indications in conjunction with assessment of cognitive decline of the participants.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10209-020-00744-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper, therefore, proposes a new machine learning model to improve the performance of IDSs by using Random Forest and a posterior detection based on coresets to improve the detection accuracy and increase detection efficiency.

Different from previous surveys, this survey especially tries to provide a systematic and comprehensive view on the security of blockchain technology within consensus and smart contracts through the integral action-pathway from root causes, vulnerabilities, and attacks, to the consequences. Moreover, the proposed countermeasures to the security issues in consensus and smart contracts are also evaluated and discussed in a holistic manner.

Processing tasks at the network edge can effectively solve the problems of personal privacy leakage and server overloading. As a result, it has attracted a great deal of attention. A number of efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) models are proposed to do so. However, since they require much computing and memory resources, none of them can be deployed to such typical edge computing devices as Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B+ to meet the real-time requirements of user tasks. Considering that a traditional machine learning method can precisely locate an object with a highly acceptable calculation load, this work reviews state-of-the-art literature and then proposes a CNN with reduced input size for an object detection system that can be deployed in edge computing devices. It splits an object detection task into object positioning and classification. In particular, this work proposes a CNN model with 44 $$\times$$ × 44-pixel inputs instead of much more inputs, e.g., 224 $$\times$$ × 224-pixel in many existing methods, for edge computing devices with slow memory access and limited computing resources.

Maximum applications built on these edge devices generate a massive amount of online data and also require real-time computation and decision making with low latency (e.g., robotics/ drones, self-driving cars, smart IoT, electronics/ wearable devices). To suffice the requirement, the future generation intelligent edge devices need to be capable of computing complex machine learning algorithms on live data in real-time. Considering different layers of IoT and distributed computing concept, this paper suggests three different operational models where the ML algorithm will be executed in a distributed manner between the edge and cloud layer of IoT so that the edge node can take a decision in real-time. The three models are; model 1: training and prediction both will be done locally by the edge, model 2: training at the server and decision making at the edge node, and model 3: distributed training and distributed decision making at the edge level with global shared knowledge and security. All three models have been tested using support vector machine using thirteen diverse datasets to profile their performance in terms of both training and inference time. A comparative study between the computational performance of the edge and cloud nodes is also presented here. Through the simulated experiments using the different datasets, it is observed that, the edge node inference time is approximately ten times faster than cloud time for all tested datasets for each proposed model.

This has enriched the domain-specific knowledge of malignant tumor prediction, we are devoid of an efficient model that may predict the stages of tumors irrespective of their origin. Thus, there is ample opportunity to study if a heterogeneous collection of tumor images can be classified according to their respective stages. The present research work has prepared a heterogeneous tumor dataset comprising eight different datasets from The Cancer Imaging Archives and classified them according to their respective stages, as suggested by the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The proposed model has been used for classifying 717 subjects comprising different imaging modalities and varied Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages. A new non-sequential deep hybrid model ensemble has been developed by exploiting branched and re-injected layers, followed by bidirectional recurrent layers to classify tumor images. Results have been compared with standard sequential deep learning models and notable recent studies. The training and validation accuracy along with the ROC-AUC scores have been found satisfactory over the existing models.

The data in cases like healthcare, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart agriculture, etc. needs to be analyzed and processed in real-time. Cisco refers to the dependence of edge and cloud as “The Fog”. The data can be analyzed at the fog layer to maximize data utilization. This paper presents a new Effective Prediction and Resource Allocation Methodology (EPRAM) for Fog environment, which is suitable for Healthcare applications. Resource Allocation (RA) represents a hard mission as it involves a set of various resources and fog nodes to achieve the required computations for IoT systems. EPRAM tries to achieve effective resource management in Fog environment via real-time resource allocating as well as prediction algorithm. EPRAM is composed of three main modules, namely: (i) Data Preprocessing Module (DPM), (ii) Resource Allocation Module (RAM) and (ii) Effective Prediction Module (EPM). The EPM uses the PNN to predict a target field, using one or more predictors. In order to detect the probability of the heart attack, PNN is trained using the training dataset. Then PNN will be tested using the user’s sensing data coming from the IoT layer to predict the probability of heart attack and then take the most appropriate action accordingly. The main goal of the system is to achieve a low latency while improving the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as (the allocation cost, the response time, bandwidth efficiency and energy consumption). Unlike other RA techniques, EPRAM employs deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in a new manner. It also uses the PNN for the prediction algorithm. It has achieved such acceptable performance due to using deep RL and PNN. Deep RL has shown impressive promises in resource allocation. PNN generates accurate predicted target and is much faster than multilayer perceptron networks. Comparing the EPRAM with the state-of-the-art algorithms, EPRAM achieved the minimum Makespan as compared to previous LB algorithms, while maximizing the Average Resource Utilization (ARU) and the Load Balancing Level (LBL). Accordingly, EPRAM is a suitable algorithm in the case of real-time systems in FC which leads to load balancing. ERAM is effective in monitoring and predicting the status of the patient accurately and quickly.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12223-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This article focuses on an approach to make urban policy more accessible and comprehensible to the general public and to government officials, while also addressing pertinent social media postings. Due to the intricacies of the natural language, ranging from complex legalese in ordinances to informal lingo in tweets, it is practical to harness human judgment here. To this end, we mine ordinances and tweets via reasoning based on commonsense knowledge so as to better account for pragmatics and semantics in the text. Ours is pioneering work in ordinance mining, and thus there is no prior labeled training data available for learning. This gap is filled by commonsense knowledge, a prudent choice in situations involving a lack of adequate training data. The ordinance mining can be beneficial to the public in fathoming policies and to officials in assessing policy effectiveness based on public reactions. This work contributes to smart governance, leveraging transparency in governing processes via public involvement. We focus significantly on ordinances contributing to smart cities, hence an important goal is to assess how well an urban region heads towards a smart city as per its policies mapping with smart city characteristics, and the corresponding public satisfaction.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10579-022-09584-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Lane detection algorithm is crucial aspect in making intelligent driving systems that can be used in autonomous self-driving vehicles, road safety, and accidents prevention systems, testing and analyzing driving skills, etc. Lane detection systems using hand crafted features fails in complex scenarios like adverse weather condition, low illumination, sharp turns and occlusion. Recently, deep learning models have been used remarkable in driving assistance systems and shows a significant improvement in their performance. Although, deep learning based methods has shown significant success in lane detection using hybrid techniques, that includes FCN, CNN and RNN. But, a safe driving assistance system can be used to save lives by avoiding accidents, it is crucial to have a real-time lane detection method. We have proposed a lightweight model that can detect lane with high accuracy and low execution time. The size of model has been kept short to make it hardware deployable and perform in real-time. We have designed and trained a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for lane detection since a CNN based model is known to work best for image classification datasets.

An essential feature in NDN is in-network caching, where the contents are decoupled from their physical locations to achieve an effective and consistent content distribution. However, caching capacity in NDN is relatively small and cannot hold all the contents requested by users. Therefore, cache space management becomes critical to address and maintain. In the literature, several solutions have been proposed to properly cache data transferred between servers and users. Most of the proposed approaches are based on name-level request analysis. Unfortunately, processing requests at the name level remains a challenging task because of their unlimited number and rapid volatility over time. In this work, we explore the role of data categorization in enhancing the cache mechanisms in NDN. We present a new caching strategy called CaDaCa (Categorized Data for Caching), where popular requests are categorized enabling in-depth knowledge about users’ behavior, which can be valuable in creating a more powerful caching mechanism. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a real-world data-set extracted from browsing history. Compared to other well-known strategies in the literature, our caching strategy achieves a higher cache hit ratio, a higher hop reduction ratio, and therefore, makes more accurate data caching decisions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00530-022-00904-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we demonstrate how to update a model on new data and an existing model to append new classes on the existing model.

It is necessary for organisations, of any size, but in particular those that are associated with a critical infrastructure, to understand the risks, so that suitable controls can be taken for the overall business continuity and critical service delivery. There are a number of works that aim to develop systematic processes for risk assessment and management. However, the existing works have limited input from threat intelligence properties and evolving attack trends, resulting in limited contextual information related to cyber security risks. This creates a challenge, especially in the context of critical infrastructures, since attacks have evolved from technical to socio-technical and protecting against them requires such contextual information. This research proposes a novel integrated cyber security risk management (i-CSRM) framework that responds to that challenge by supporting systematic identification of critical assets through the use of a decision support mechanism built on fuzzy set theory, by predicting risk types through machine learning techniques, and by assessing the effectiveness of existing controls. The framework is composed of a language, a process, and it is supported by an automated tool. The paper also reports on the evaluation of our work to a real case study of a critical infrastructure. The results reveal that using the fuzzy set theory in assessing assets' criticality, our work supports stakeholders towards an effective risk management by assessing each asset's criticality.

The ITMS consists of three main layers, which are: Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and cloud layers. Edge can collect real-time data from different routes through IoT devices such as wireless sensors, and then it can compute and store this collected data before transmitting them to the cloud for further processing. Thus, an edge is an intermediate layer between IoT and cloud layers that can receive the transmitted data through IoT to overcome cloud challenges such as high latency. In this paper, a novel real-time traffic congestion prediction strategy (TCPS) is proposed based on the collected data in the edge’s cache server at the edge layer. The proposed TCPS contains three stages, which are: (i) real-time congestion prediction (RCP) stage, (ii) congestion direction detection (CD 2 ) stage, and (iii) width change decision (WCD) stage. The RCP aims to predict traffic congestion based on the causes of congestion in the hotspot using a fuzzy inference system. If there is congestion, the CD 2 stage is used to detect the congestion direction based on the predictions from the RCP by using the Optimal Weighted Naïve Bayes (OWNB) method. The WCD stage aims to prevent the congestion occurrence in which it is used to change the width of changeable routes (CR) after detecting the direction of congestion in CD 2 . The experimental results have shown that the proposed TCPS outperforms other recent methodologies. TCPS provides the highest accuracy, precision, and recall.

Modeling of the complex relationships between these variables by sophisticated methods in machine learning is a promising field. The objectives of this work are to develop a supervised model for the prediction of air pollution by using real sensor data and to transfer the model between cities. The combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory deep neural network model was proposed to predict the concentration of air pollutants in multiple locations of a city by using spatial-temporal relationships. Two approaches have been adopted: the univariate model contains the information of one pollutant whereas the multivariate model contains the information of all pollutants and meteorology data for prediction. The study was carried out for different pollutants which are in the publicly available data of the cities of Barcelona, Kocaeli, and İstanbul. The hyperparameters of the model (filter, frame, and batch sizes; number of convolutional/LSTM layers and hidden units; learning rate; and parameters for sample selection, pooling, and validation) were tuned to determine the architecture that achieved the lowest test error.

It is promising for urban video systems that require efficient and effective processing for their intelligent monitoring drives on various ends, like sky drones and land cameras. For instance, to support crowd recognition for public safety, the tasks to crowd recognition need to be placed into all processing nodes in the video systems for processing effectively. This is a challenging problem to facilitate the edge-cloud orchestrated scenarios. However, the variability of tasks based on their complexities is not considered fully in existing strategies. In this regard, we model and analyse task placement for crowd recognition in edge-cloud intelligent video systems. Then, our strategies are proposed which are referred to Node-Graph based Task Placement ( NGTP ) and Cluster-Graph based Task Placement ( CGTP ). Specifically, with the help of data dependencies, NGTP utilises the greedy approach with node graphs in the centralised way for general scenarios. Comparatively, CGTP utilises data dependency and similarity for task placing in the decentralised way for emergency scenarios. The experiments demonstrate the superior and effectiveness performance in forming tasks cost and running time of our proposed approaches.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03392-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

CNN is utilized to generate a public key to be based on the image in order to enhance the key sensitivity of the scheme. Initial values and control parameters are then obtained from the key to be used in the chaotic log-map, and thus a chaotic sequence is produced for the encrypting operations. The scheme then encrypts the images by scrambling and manipulating the pixels of images through four operations: permutation, DNA encoding, diffusion, and bit reversion. The encryption scheme is precisely examined for the well-known images in terms of various cryptanalyses such as key-space, key sensitivity, information entropy, histogram, correlation, differential attack, noisy attack, and cropping attack. To corroborate the image encryption scheme, the visual and numerical results are even compared with available scores of the state of the art. Therefore, the proposed log-map-based image encryption scheme is successfully verified and validated by superior absolute and comparative results. As future work, the proposed log-map can be extended to combinational multi-dimensional with existing efficient chaotic maps.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11803-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Cloud computing which is an on-request conveyance of computing power, applications, database storage, and other IT assets by means of the Internet has violently expanded our computerized lives.

Data organizations foresee a decrease in the quantity of data centers, as more businesses close their little data centers and move towards cloud computing. All things considered, the move by clients towards cloud, will increase the general energy utilization significantly, exceeding any energy productivity increase; which has recorded for over 70% of data center development in 2018. Many research advancements are already made in this domain for minimizing the energy utilization of the computing types of gear included; for efficient power energy consumption, decrease of carbon impression and e-squander. These procedures are supporters of green cloud computing, which are focused on planning and advancing energy-proficient activities to contain inordinate energy utilization in data centers. This paper discusses different mechanisms for lowering the power utilization in data centers. It provides in depth detail about the various mechanisms that can be employed at the hardware component level so that the utilization of energy by component can be reduced.

Several offline approaches have been proposed to address this task; however, they are not compatible with real-world applications due to their high latency and post-processing requirements. This lack of suitable approaches motivates our proposal: A new low-latency online approach for MTMC tracking in scenarios with partially overlapping fields of view (FOVs), such as road intersections. Firstly, the proposed approach detects vehicles at each camera. Then, the detections are merged between cameras by applying cross-camera clustering based on appearance and location. Lastly, the clusters containing different detections of the same vehicle are temporally associated to compute the tracks on a frame-by-frame basis. The experiments show promising low-latency results while addressing real-world challenges such as the a priori unknown and time-varying number of targets and the continuous state estimation of them without performing any post-processing of the trajectories.

This has promoted a new range of modelling tools specially designed for their use in mobility. Such tools open the door to modelling in dynamic scenarios that go beyond the capabilities of traditional desktop tools. For example, modelling in mobility can be useful to design smart factories on-site, or to create models of hiking routes while walking along the routes, among many other scenarios. In this paper, we report on a systematic mapping study to identify the state of the art and trends in modelling on mobile devices.

The core theme of IoT has been supporting the design of sustainable building models with standard architecture to boost optimal energy conservation and its efficiency. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are associated with IoT, represent functional networks in assisting the monitoring, tracking and sensing different environmental activities. Sensors characteristics play the leading role in designing and applying any WSN. The main problem of coverage factor, predictive event score, dependability ratio, error effect, and energy usage in the sensing node relies on the average node timings in WSN for the power-sharing and processing of communication networks that mainly includes information exchange. This study primarily dealt with formulating and implementing a Hybridized IoT-Assisted Hierarchy-based Computation Strategy (HIHCS) technique and an Active Randomized Optimization Strategy (AROS) to help alleviate the energy problems in a Smart City surveillance using WSN. The energy-controlled sensor node also negotiates many network-related tasks and improves energy utilization and detection precision throughout data processing by adopting an optimal cluster node. The experiments revealed that both the HIHCS and AROS methods could enhance energy savings, especially during cluster node selection in WSN. Ultimately, the result proves that the proposed system improvises the performance of WSN-bound IoT based smart city applications, which are evident through the average resultants: performance ratio (83.97%), event predictive score (77%), dependability ratio (86.23%), energy consumption (58.96%), coverage factor (70.43), and error effect (27.91%).",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-021-01585-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional assessment models consider the static and demographic data to predict the likelihood of customer turning to bad debtors. This paper proposes a novel fog assisted IoT based three- tier framework for credit risk assessment that can be deployed for evaluating the risk of both existing borrowers and new applicants. The RFM (Recenecy, Frequency, Monetary) and behavioral data are captured through User Device layer. Real time behaviour score of existing borrowers is computed to find cluster of risky clients who are indulged in hefty spending and possess an unfavorable behaviour. Fog layer sends alert messages to high risky borrowers as well as to the dealing officers in banks. ASW (Average Silhouette Width) metric is utilized to assess quality of clusters. At the cloud layer, heat map analysis is performed to find risky geographical areas where majority of existing borrowers are prone to overspending propensity. The identified (risky/non-risky) region codes are augmented to the demographic details of new loan applicants to classify them as potential High risky/Moderate Risky/Low risky/No Risk. Experimental results reveal that the inclusion of region code enhances accuracy from 0.8867 to 0.9244. AUC (Area under curve) and other vital statistical measures are also elevated.

To manage such networks, dynamic and automated solutions for operation and maintenance tasks are needed to reduce human errors, save on Operating expense (OPEX) and optimize network resources. Self Organizing Networks (SON) are a promising tool in achieving this goal, and one of the essential use cases is Physical Cell Identity (PCI) assignment. There are only 504 unique PCIs, which inevitably leads to PCI reuse in dense and heterogeneous networks. This can create PCI collisions and confusions, but also a range of modulo PCI issues. These PCI issues can lead to use cases where User Equipments (UEs) cannot properly identify a cell or cells cannot properly identify UEs, especially during handovers, which all leads to radio communication failure. Therefore, a proper PCI assignment is crucial for network performance. In this paper, we first conduct a study on the impact of different PCI issues on the performance of the network by doing experiments on real-life hardware. Based on the finding from the experiments we create two SON algorithms: a Weighted Automatic Neighbor Relations (ANR) and a PCI assignment algorithm ALPACA. The Weighted ANR creates neighbor relations based on measurements from the network and calculates weights for cells and neighbor relations. ALPACA uses these weights to assign PCI values to cells in a way that avoids PCI issues or at least minimizes their effects on the network. ALPACA works in phases to allow it to adapt to dynamic network topology changes and continuously optimize the network. We validate and evaluate our approach using a simulator package that we have developed. The results show that ALPACA can resolve all collisions and confusion for up to 1000 cells in a highly dense topology, as well as minimize the effects of inevitable modulo PCI issues.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10922-022-09644-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Tasks with soft deadlines can miss their primary deadlines, but not by too much, and still be timely. This has not been properly considered by existing offloading approaches. In this paper, we propose CONFECT, a novel offloading approach that handles tasks with mixtures of hard deadlines and soft deadlines. Specifically, we first formulate the problem as an integer linear programming and prove its hardness. Then, we propose two online algorithms with proven competitive ratios to solve the problem collectively, including an algorithm that assigns tasks to edge servers to maximize the task completion ratio and an algorithm that adjusts the task execution order to maximize the task completion revenue. Moreover, to balance the fairness among tasks and system revenue elastically, we extend CONFECT by using a tunable fairness knob.

In recent years, various approaches to the issue have been offered, but the techniques and conclusions are still in their infancy. This paper proposes a deep learning accident prediction model that combines information extracted from tweet messages with extended features like sentiment analysis, emotions, weather, geo-coded locations, and time information. The results obtained show that the accuracy is increased by 8% for accident detection, making test accuracy reach 94%. In comparison with the existing state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed algorithm outperformed by achieving an increase in the accuracy by 2% and 3% respectively making the accuracy reach 97.5% and 90%. Our solution also resolved high-performance computing limitations induced by detector-based accident detection which involved huge data computation. The results achieved has further strengthened confidence that using advanced features aid in the better detection and prediction of traffic accidents.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03502-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since these people have very unreliable sources of income, a dilemma arises: they must either work under risky conditions or refrain from work and suffer from income cuts. Emergency donations of food and cleaning supplies in a pandemic context might be overlooked by government and civil society actors. This paper aims to model the effects of donations on mitigating the negative effects of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities. Applying the system dynamics method, we simulated the behaviour of the pandemic in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) communities and the impacts that donations of food and cleaning supplies have in these settings. We administered surveys to the beneficiaries and local organisations responsible for the final distribution of donations to gather information from the field operations. The results show that increasing access to cleaning supplies in communities through donations can significantly reduce coronavirus transmission, particularly in high-density and low-resource areas, such as slums in urban settings. In addition, we also show that food donations can increase the vulnerable population’s ability to afford necessities, alleviating the stress caused by the pandemic on this portion of the population. Therefore, this work helps decision-makers (such as government and non-governmental organisations) understand the impacts of donations on controlling outbreaks, especially under COVID-19 conditions, in a low-resource environment and, thus, aid these hard-to-reach populations in a pandemic setting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04378-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The challenges indicated are Cybersecurity and Data privacy in this instance. Additional challenges are set out supported by literature, in researching data security management systems and legal frameworks to ascertaining the types and varieties of valid encryption, data acquisition, policy and outcomes under ISO 27001 and the General Data Protection Regulations. Blockchain, a revolutionary method of storage and immutability, provides a robust storage strategy, and when coupled with a Smart Contract, gives users the ability to form partnerships, share information and consent via a legally-based system of carrying out business transactions in a secure digital domain. Globally, ethical and legal challenges significantly differ; consent and trust in the public and private sectors in deploying such defensive data management strategies, is directly related to the accountability and transparency systems in place to deliver certainty and justice. Therefore, investment and research in these areas is crucial to establishing a dialogue between nations to include health, finance and market strategies that should encompass all levels of society. A framework is proposed with elements to include Big Data, Machine Learning and Visualisation methods and techniques. Through the literature we identify a system necessary in carrying out experiments to detect, capture, process and store data.

Each member of the collective of autonomous vehicles tries to adapt to the changing environment, therefore together they execute decentralised autonomous adaptation by exploiting real-time information about their environment. The routing of these vehicles needs proper computer science models to be able to develop the best information technology for their control. We review different traffic flow models in computer science, and we evaluate their usefulness and applicability to autonomous vehicles. The classical game theory model implies flow level decision making in route selection. Non-cooperative autonomous vehicles may produce unwanted traffic patterns. Improved decentralised autonomous adaptation techniques try to establish some kind of coordination among autonomous vehicles, mainly through intention awareness. The aggregation of the intentions of autonomous vehicles may help to predict future traffic situations. The novel intention-aware online routing game model points out that intention-awareness helps to avoid that the traffic generated by autonomous vehicles be worse than the traffic indicated by classical traffic flow models. The review helps to make the first steps towards research on global level control of autonomous vehicles by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different formal models.

Accordingly, mobile edge computing (MEC) came into picture as novel emerging solutions to overcome many cloud computing issues. In this contemporary technology, the computation server and processing units are nearby edge servers to reduce latency, increase the network bandwidth and reduce energy consumption in user devices. These features can integrate with several domains such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence (AI), federated learning (FL) and fog computing, etc., to make the system more robust, elastic, efficient, and accurate.

Although, various studies have been found tuning MEC to solve such challenges, the literature provide more ideas for smart developments toward applications particularly using FL and AI. Most researches miss combining interesting aspects of MEC, such as machine learning and deep learning approaches limiting works to only single aspect. Thus, a literature work is needed to focus on all the aspects of MEC together. This study aims to present a comprehensive survey on MEC by providing all necessary information, including network architecture, advantages, objectives, access technologies, deployment templates, characteristics, and many more. The work is not limited to only MEC background but also covers the AI and FL approaches used within MEC, allowing mobile phones to learn a shared predictive model collaboratively.

In a typical smart city context, citizens are already interconnected via smart mobile devices and wearable devices. The hospitals, vehicles, houses, traffic surveillance systems, public places, and other social systems in the city are all connected over the Internet, which is known as the Internet of Things (IoT).

All such connected (smart) devices generate immense data that needs to be examined and analysed, to ensure that they continually learn from the available datasets and better themselves without any manual interference. This is where the prerequisite for machine learning comes into being. Several ML algorithms and techniques are introduced in a short time to easily evaluate big data measurements, increasing the IoT’s productivity. Similarly, special ML techniques, such as decision trees, clustering and neural and Bayesian networks, allow devices and gadgets to discern trends from various sources in different kinds of datasets and take appropriate decisions based on their analysis. It would really be difficult for smart devices to make smart decisions gradually without including and enforcing ML.

The Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) technology refers to a combination of cognitive systems and IoT. A benefit of this technology is that the management problems of the IoT will be solved by solutions that come from cognitive systems domain. In recent years, CIoT has received much attention. This is because the management algorithms of the IoT are very complex and therefore human thinking processes as computerized cognitive processes are required for fast and accurate decision-making. Existing algorithms reported as management mechanisms for CIoT only focus on utilizing artificial intelligence without considering fundamental issues of cognitive systems such as predictability, controllability, responsibility, safety, security, and energy consumption. Ignoring these issues may result in designing inappropriate cognitive systems that may be faced with a wide range of problems such as hacking and failure.

However, one of the significant issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the rapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be uninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to understand the decision and bias to control and trust systems’ unexpected or seemingly unpredictable outputs. It is acknowledged that the loss of control over interpretability of decision-making becomes a critical issue for many data-driven automated applications.

We examine practical examples for Smart City applications to improve resilience, including sensor networks in early warning systems in Japan, Blockchain applications for disaster relief fund distributions in Vanuatu and using Artificial Intelligence to better understand social resilience in Haiti. We also look at examples of new hazards and risks for cities such as cyber security, privacy issues and threats to economic and material resilience of a city coming from digitalization. As a synthesis, we propose that both concepts are used deliberately and consciously as conceptual lenses to guide urban development practice. We propose that Smart Cities are best to be used as a tool for urban development, not as a normative goal or vision. We suggest that the Resilient City concept provides a lens that can help set the goals and targets for Smart Cities, but also needs to consider new types of risks in what we call digital resilience .",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95037-8_16,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An important means to such adaptability is through the use of simulation models which can be leveraged in a dynamic decision support system. To provide high quality decision support, one can use simulations in an optimization loop to derive the best values of system parameters for a given system state particularly when the system has too many parameters and traditional means to optimize the outcomes are intractable. To that end, simulation-based optimization (SBO) methods have emerged to enable optimization in the context of complex, black-box simulations obviating the need for specific and accurate model information, such as gradient computation. An important challenge in using SBO is determining the decision parameters. However, to ensure scalability and real-time decision support, one must be able to rapidly deploy SBO in a way that makes the best use of available computing resources given the time and budget constraints. To address these needs, this chapter presents a cloud-based framework for simulation-based optimization as a service (SBOaaS) to enable a flexible and highly parallelizable dynamic decision support for such environments.

Deep learning models provide better results and improvement as compared to traditional machine learning in many areas such as language translation, speech recognition, stock market, healthcare, etc. Today’s most of the deep learning frameworks are open source and freely available for use. Deep learning frameworks provide building blocks for validation of deep learning neural networks, training, and designing with the interface of high-level programming. Some of the most used frameworks are MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. On another side, the Internet of Things (or Internet Connected Things) has attracted many applications and sectors for producing results efficiently, and these devices have made people’s life longer to live. These devices are generating a lot of data (called big data) which can be used for further prediction/forecast by modern deep learning models. In deep learning, complex problems can be solved with the help of modern tools. Differently, each framework is built for a different purpose. These frameworks are often evolving and getting better very rapidly. There are many criteria to choose a framework.

The security concerns become more critical when the unauthorized user accessing the network services using a paired network device (i.e. Smart phone or laptop). Therefore, an authentication system is required that continuously observe the activities of the end device user using a continuous authentication system. In order to address this challenge, in this paper a noble continuous behavioral authentication system has been introduced by considering the limitations of IoT devices such as battery power and other computational resources. The proposed authentication model involves the machine learning based techniques to analyze the application usages patterns to discover the misleading user behavior. In addition, the correlation coefficient is used for feature ranking. The ranked features are used with three different machine learning algorithms namely support vector machine (SVM) with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), radial basis function (RBF) based SVM-SMO, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

This makes the education of AI software engineers particularly challenging, since there are no well-established methodologies, tools and practices, like in traditional Software Engineering (SE) education drawing on decades of experience and methods in all phases of software development, from requirements analysis over design and implementation to integration and testing. We analyze the main differences between traditional SE and AISE education and address challenges in AISE education. Our methodology is based on literature survey, analysis of own industry experience and statistical analysis of students works on AI applications. Our goal is to provide guidelines for an AISE process and propose a curriculum path for AISE education, which can be used to update a traditional SE curriculum. According to results of our analysis, the main challenges for the students are: Dealing with data and taking into account that algorithms change (learn) by data, selection and re-use of AI algorithms, model test, maintenance and automatizing the AISE process. We propose to address these challenges in SE curricula by teaching more statistical thinking with connections to software development, developing re-engineering capabilities, teaching a model-based AI approach and combining AI with virtual reality simulations.

When we try to control the environment, it just sails away. Humans have come to realize that regulating the environment is impossible since nature always finds a way to get its own way. Humans, on the other hand, have evolved ways for predicting the environment’s behavior by monitoring abrupt changes in the paraments and making essential calculations. Computers have taken over the majority of the computations, and artificial Inelegance algorithms have taken over the prediction systems, over time. However, the quality of the information utilized to make an informed decision is critical to protecting our environment. In today's environmental protection, computers play an important role in duties including monitoring, data processing, and communication. AI approaches have had a profound effect on environmental decision support systems’ conception and development. Many articles were analyzed and categorized in order to uncover answers that already exist related to the impact of the environmental changes. Access to dynamic environmental information may be gained using GeoWeb APIs. In order to bring processing to the data, cloud computing and array-friendly databases would be helpful. Geotagging and location sensing will help convert citizen scientists into environmental data collectors. The usage of a combined cycle steam power plant for electricity generation has been observed.

The lock-in effect is a scenario in which the consumers feel difficulty in migrating from one cloud to another without inconvenience which is solved by the deployment of multi-cloud. Service provisioning is the process of delivering the virtualized physical resources, applications, and infrastructure. There is a need for intelligent service provisioning (ISP) in multi-cloud because the cloud user faces difficulty in choosing the appropriate services from variety of services provided by a large number of cloud providers. By providing with appropriate cloud services to the user, the service level agreements (SLAs) are fulfilled. Quality of Service (QoS) is also satisfied through ISP. Intelligent Cloud Broker (ICB) is often used for simplifying the services selection task. ICB acts as an efficient mediator between cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud user. It acts as a tool for provisioning of services. ISP is made possible through the incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques. Machine learning (ML) technique is widely used in many applications for making the system to produce intelligent decisions. Intelligent service provisioning provides efficient orchestration of services in multi-cloud which involves management of resources, application, and decision-making for provisioning of services. The ISP can perform with the presence of intelligent Broker or without it.

However, as the cities’ infrastructure develops, the emerging data sources generate massive datasets. Currently, the efficient and accurate processing of smart cities’ enormous time series datasets poses a particular challenge to data scientists. To overcome this problem, many high-level representations of time series have been proposed, including Fourier transform, wavelet transform, or symbolic representation. Applying fundamental symbolization techniques for time series with multiple variables, such as Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX), results in distinct sequences of symbols for each variable. A novel multivariate extension of SAX will be presented, which allows to express a multivariate time series with one sequence of symbols. Integrating individual sequences in one symbolic sequence provides better expressive power, while our modified SAX distance measure can be applied for clustering and classification tasks in smart cities, decreasing the enormous dataset storage and speeding up the big data processing.

As a result, edge clouds for many applications (e.g. agriculture, ecology, and smart city deployments) must operate in remote, unattended, and environmentally harsh settings, introducing new challenges. One key challenge is heat exposure, which can degrade the performance, reliability, and longevity of electronics. For edge clouds, these problems are exacerbated because they increasingly perform complex workloads, such as machine learning, to affect data-driven actuation and control of devices and systems in the environment. The goal of our work is to protect edge clouds from overheating. To enable this, we develop a heat-budget-based scheduling system, called Sparta, which leverages dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to adaptively control CPU temperature. Sparta takes machine learning applications, datasets, and a temperature threshold as input. It sets the initial frequency of the CPU based on historical data and then dynamically updates it, according to the applications’ execution profile and ambient temperature, to safeguard edge devices. We find that for a suite of machine learning applications and deployment temperatures, Sparta is able to maintain CPU temperature below the threshold 94% of the time while facilitating improvements in execution time by 1.04x − 1.32x over competitive approaches.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-96504-4_2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Users’ attention may be directed via eye gazing, which can enhance Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). Gaze estimation can make HCI more natural in a non-intrusive way. For example, tiredness detection, biometric identification, illness diagnosis, activity recognition, an estimate of alertness level and gaze-contingent display are all possible uses of eye-tracking. It's been available for decades, but it's not been widely used in consumer applications. The high cost of eye-tracking technology and the lack of consumer-level applications are the main reasons behind this. When it comes to Activities of Daily Living (ADL), assistive robots may restore essential levels of independence for the elderly and others who are disabled. Although people can communicate their wishes in numerous ways, linguistic patterns and gaze-based implicit communication of intentions remain underdeveloped, such as bodily expressions or actions. In this study, based on the eye view, a new, implicit, nonverbal communication paradigm for HCI is introduced. Conventional gaze detection systems rely on infrared lights and cameras with high-resolution sensors to achieve outstanding performance and durability. But these systems need to be modified. Thus they are confined to laboratory research and challenging to apply in the real world. Here, we recommend that the gaze be followed using a webcam. Using a webcam to obtain 2D coordinates, we provide a practical visual monitoring framework based on models. This work on the platform is intended to ease HCI and thus increase useful technology and consumers’ privacy in their daily lives. The test results of this experiment indicated that implicit human gaze patterns on visualized objects could efficiently be used for contact with people's intentions. Studies have also shown that it is simple to comprehend and use contact with the gaze. It is further suggested that the subject-dependent eye parameters are calculated using a specific reference system. Finally, an implicit communication system for monitoring and interpreting purposes has been developed. After understanding the user's implicit intention to support the elderly with the action of the eye-gaze, the device can distinguish the activities/requirements required from the home environment.

Running such applications on mobile devices was challenging since mobile computing has inherent problems such as resource scarcity, frequent disconnections and mainly mobility. To address the shortcomings of mobile computing, researchers have used the concept of Cloud Computing (CC) to perform resource-intensive tasks outside mobile devices. This led to mobile and cloud computing convergence and the emergence of a new computing paradigm, the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), also called Mobile Cloud , which could effectively alleviate the problems of mobile computing. More sophisticated applications, such as online gaming, augmented reality, and virtual reality, which require broad bandwidth, low response latency and large computational power have emerged. In general, such a system relies on distant cloud services to perform all the data processing tasks, which result in explicit latency. The most promising solution for the requirements of aforesaid applications was the placement of content, compute, and cloud resources on the edge of the network, closer to concentrations of users. Consequently, Edge Computing (EC), which utilizes the proximal computational and networking resources, has arisen. The concept of Edge Computing was introduced, initially in the form of Cloudlets that assist mobile devices to gain computational and storage performance benefits, which later paved the way towards the concepts of Fog computing and Mobile Edge Computing, which essentially has to be referred as Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). Thus, mobile cloud has extended its computation model from centralized to distributed, from Internet cloud to edge cloud, and from mobile devices to mobile services. In this survey paper we investigate the pre-existing works in MCC to determine their role in the current trends for edge computing. We provide a holistic overview on the exploitation of EC for the realization of pervasive mobile applications and we briefly present the state-of-the art of edge computing paradigms and the key enabling technologies. We also briefly present how the crowd sourcing was based on the MCC to work efficiently and how MEC enriches the dynamics of crowd sourcing. Finally, we present the open research challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87049-2_30,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The persistent possibility of terrorist attacks at public and secured locations raises the need for powerful monitoring systems with subsystems for embedded object tracking. Object tracking is one of machine vision’s basic challenges and has been actively researched for decades. Object tracking is a process to locate a moving object over time across a series of video frames. Object tracking powered with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a broad range of applications such as smart camera surveillance, traffic video surveillance, event prediction and identification, motion detection, human-computer interaction, and perception of human behavior. Real-time visual tracking requires high-response time sensors, tracker speed performance, and large storage requirements. Researchers have ascertained and acknowledged that there is a significant change in the efficacy of drone-based surveillance systems towards object tracking with the inception of the deep learning technologies. Several tracking approaches and models have been proposed by researchers in the area of object tracking and have experienced major improvements with advancement in methods, but object tracking is still considered to be a hard problem to solve. This chapter explains state-of-the-art object tracking algorithms and presents views on current and future trends in object tracking and deep learning surveillance. It also provides an analytical discussion on multi-object tracking experiments based on various datasets available for surveillance and the corresponding results obtained from the research conducted in the near past. FairMOT, GNNMatch, MPNTrack, Lif T, GSDT, and Tracktor++ are among the methods investigated. For the MOT16 and MOT17 datasets, FairMOT generated accuracy of 74.9 and 73.7, respectively, whereas GSDT provided accuracy of 60.7 and 67.1 for the 2DMOT15 and MOT20 datasets. FairMOT is an efficient tracker among the models tested, while MPNTrack is significantly more stable and retains tracklet IDs intact across frames in a series. This concludes FairMOT being an efficient tracker and MPNTrack a stable one.

The shift that we are witnessing toward the adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is going to be perhaps the most disruptive since the early days of automobiles and could revolutionize movement of people and goods. This level of connectivity and autonomy will transform transportation in several dimensions with important societal and economic impacts: improved safety, increased comfort, time saving potential, and more efficient road utilization are among the most widely discussed positive impacts of CAVs. However, the potential energy efficiency benefits of these technologies remain uncertain. From a single-vehicle efficiency perspective, research suggests that lightweight, low-speed, autonomous vehicles have the potential to achieve fuel economy an order of magnitude higher than current cars. Yet, at system-wide level, current estimates suggest that the total energy consumption impacts can range from a 90% decrease to a 200% increase in fuel consumption as compared to a projected 2050 baseline energy consumption. The paradigm that traffic congestion mitigation should reduce CO 2 emissions is yet to be proved. Therefore, interest in transportation regulation problems with explicit environmental considerations is growing. This work takes a more in-depth look at increased opportunities for energy-efficient driving with energy-oriented traffic management and CAVs deployment. In particular, the focus will be put on the road traffic control strategies in urban networks using connectivity to enable variable speed limits and traffic light adaptive control, as well as the energy-saving opportunities that arise for individual CAVs by anticipating future road geometry, traffic conditions, and interactions with neighboring vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-72579-2_128,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Towards this, end the convergence of Machine Learning (ML) models have facilitated promising outcomes in delivering intelligent predictive systems towards the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) paradigms. A major challenge to this end remains in the service discovery among wearable technology for identifying healthcare applications. This paper explores the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach for addressing the NP-hardness of conventional ML models for service discovery in healthcare big data. Here, three different Ml classifiers viz., LogitBoost, Naïve Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF) models are considered in convergence with GA approach. The performance of the algorithms is comparatively studied for different effectiveness measures such as precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy. It was experimentally observed that the GA-RF model outperformed the predictive performance of the other classification models by providing an accuracy of 0.9413 with considerable improvement from the other two models. Thus, the proposed approach provides an intelligent low-complexity solution for service discovery in IoHT applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-3089-8_50,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

UAV-based communications and networking can enhance wireless connectivity by integrating UAVs as aerial base stations and aerial user equipment into an existing 5G terrestrial heterogeneous network (HetNet). This chapter designs a public safety 3-tier aerial HetNet (Aerial-HetNet) composed of macrocells and picocells on the ground and small cells carried by UAVs. In particular, this chapter proposes an Aerial-HetNet with optimally placed UAVs for guaranteed quality-of-service. This proposed Aerial-HetNet also considers range expansion bias at small cells, various inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) for interference mitigation, 3D beamforming for antennas, and 3D channel modeling for UAVs. Furthermore, the performance of designed Aerial-HetNet with optimally placed UAVs is evaluated in the coverage probability and fifth-percentile spectral efficiency (5pSE), using various heuristics algorithms and a brute-force. The Aerial-HetNet’s system-wide coverage probability and 5pSE are computed and compared when the unmanned aerial base stations (UABS) are deployed on fixed hexagonal locations using computer-based Matlab simulations. UABS locations are optimized using an elitist harmony search genetic algorithm (eHSGA) and genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation results show that the heuristic algorithms (eHSGA and GA) outperform the brute-force approach and achieved higher peak values of 5pSE and coverage probability. Furthermore, simulation results reveal that the Aerial-HetNet performance of the low-altitude UABSs at 25 m is sparsely better than medium-altitude UABSs (50 m and 36 m). Finally, a trade-off is encountered between achieving the peak Aerial-HetNet performance and the computation time, while applying different heuristic algorithms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1292-4_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Nowadays the smart cities are using the technology of smart meters in their household, which can transfer the electrical data in a bi-directional way to consumers and smart grids. It consists of various Internet-connected sensors, software applications, to connect different devices. This makes the smart grid network more complex which is further vulnerable to the cyber-attack. Moreover, it gives rise to various malicious attack such as false data injection (FDI) in smart meters which leads to incorrect decisions due to a large number of open access points in a network; which is accessible to outside intruders. In smart meters, Home Area Network (HAN) and smart meter collectors are more vulnerable for cyber-attacks as they are directly involved in bi-directional communication between the devices such as smart grid, data connectors, and smart meters. Since smart meters work in a distributed environment where fog computing (FC) placed at the edge of the networks can play a major role by integrating with blockchain for secure electric data transmission and to avoid the FDI in smart meters. Here FC nodes will act as miners to makes the decisions on the data transmission while monitoring the states of the system. Hence, we propose a novel solution for the above mention issue which consists of 3-tier FC-based blockchain architecture and Smart Meter-based Q-Learning Encryption (SMQE) algorithm to verify the system in FC environment. The algorithm performs the identification of FDI, and malicious attacks conducted on smart meters during data transmission. It opens a blockchain-based channel for secure data transmission in smart meters.

The framework is designed as a decentralized application over blockchain and makes use of interplanetary file system for storage. As transportation infrastructures like CCTV and road side units become increasingly intelligent over time, they are expected to detect traffic events like accidents and traffic rule violations at the edge using machine learning techniques without human intervention.

This event is more unwanted than unusual as most of the time this is caused due to reasons, we remain unaware of. Disasters could be natural or man-made like floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, accidents, gas leakage, forest fire, etc. Since the disaster occurs due to reasons that are unknown and is an untimely phenomenon, we have a lesser scope of avoiding it. The use of emerging technologies, early warnings, immediate incidence response, and post-recovery activities can well be employed to mitigate the losses that the disaster would lead to. One such emerging technology is the Internet of things (IoT). The sensor nodes used in an IoT architecture independently are capable of sensing the environment and gathering data. This data can be further sent to the sink node/base station which has the responsibility of reporting the data ahead of the network, for initiating actuation on the basis of the data gathered and analyzing the data. This can help in monitoring for the purpose of early warning of disasters. The actuations can help provide immediate incidence response. Furthermore, upon the integration of data analytics with IoT, the data generated with the help of sensors can be used for predictive analysis and inference drawing in order to enable early disaster prediction and mitigation of losses that might occur due to the same. Thus, the potential of IoT is to provide rescue, response, mitigation, and preparedness to manage a disaster.

The digitalization of services has resulted in a compelling, major change in the sector, which is now referred to as Industry 4.0. One of the major changes embracing this industrial revolution is the development of robotics. Today, with the tasks becoming increasingly complex, robots are more trusted to perform the tasks with accuracy. They are rapidly substituting human skills in terms of speed, accuracy, and replaceability. Over the years, they have made vital contributions to some of the major industries, like 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, computer chip building, health and safety, agriculture, and so on. Robotics is a key Industry 4.0 technology that gives significant possibilities in the realm of production. However, with the introduction of Industry 4.0, it has become increasingly impossible for a corporation to remain relevant without incorporating some type of intelligent technology. Big data, which is generated by a wide range of sensors, necessitates complicated systems capable of distilling usable information and making intelligent judgments. This is where technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning may help. The major result of combining these technologies with modern robotics is the creation of intelligent factories that are very powerful, safe, and cost-effective.

The natural parameters that influence the quality and quantity of crops are rainfall, temperature, humidity, and many more. The modern-day agriculture faces uncertainty due to a change in climate conditions and irregularities due to climate change. In order to avoid that, a major update in the current agriculture sector is essential. To compensate for the irregularities of the natural requirements, pumping, sprinkling, and other such methods are used. However, often they are not controlled without a human supervision. Hence without proper regulation, overwatering, under watering, and excess or lack of light and other such factors cause loss of harvest.

IoT devices and their use remain a big area of opportunity, but they are complicated by a lack of regulation as well as numerous security and privacy issues caused by design and setup flaws. Many current attacks against SMEs demonstrate that IoT devices make the networks vulnerable and expand the attack surface. Considering the widespread use of IoT devices and the security flaws they have, various parties have tried to provide security frameworks to teach users how to securely deploy these devices. They aimed to advocate that IoT devices should be subjected to strict security and privacy rules in isolated subnetworks, which has been proven to be a promising technique for securing networks, devices, and data. However, these frameworks are aimed at IT professionals rather than average users. In this study, we tried to educate normal users to securely deploy IoT devices. To achieve this goal, we have provided a set of best practices collected from existing standard frameworks. We have demonstrated the implementation of these security measures in two different scenarios using various network devices and with consideration of SME limitations. Some of the security measures are directly related to the device, and there is not much the consumer can do. However, if the technology is supported by the device, the users should be educated accordingly. To successfully achieve the aim of the study, we will investigate the existing vulnerabilities of smart devices and evaluate the existing guidelines for secure deployment of IoT devices. Then we will implement the current best practices for safeguarding computer networks, with a focus on IoT challenges and finally, we will pave the way to propose a practical framework for safely deploying IoT devices in small and medium enterprises.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98225-6_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Faulty sensors may compromise the reliability of SHM systems, causing data corruption, data loss, and erroneous judgment of structural conditions. Fault diagnosis (FD) of SHM systems encompasses the detection, isolation, identification, and accommodation of sensor faults, aiming to ensure the reliability of SHM systems. Typically, FD is based on “analytical redundancy,” utilizing correlated sensor data inherent to the SHM system. However, most analytical redundancy FD approaches neglect the fault identification step and are tailored to specific types of sensor data. In this chapter, an analytical redundancy FD approach for SHM systems is presented, coupling methods for processing any type of sensor data and two machine learning (ML) techniques, (i) an ML regression algorithm used for fault detection, fault isolation, and fault accommodation, and (ii) an ML classification algorithm used for fault identification. The FD approach is validated using an artificial neural network as ML regression algorithm and a convolutional neural network as ML classification algorithm. Validation is performed through a real-world SHM system in operation at a railway bridge. The results demonstrate the suitability of the FD approach for ensuring reliable SHM systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81716-9_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Maintaining a system is necessary for a time-saving life because of the comfortable lifestyle and digital security. For instance, we must be concerned about the daily road accidents by automobiles to achieve the security required to construct a smart city. Every year, hundreds of people are killed in car accidents around the world as a result of drowsy drivers. This information emphasizes the importance of a sleep sensor application in preventing such tragedies and, ultimately, saving lives. To address this challenge, we offer a unique intensive learning strategy based on neutral neural networks (CNN). The goal of the chapter is to create a working prototype of a sleepiness detection system that can help to make a smart city. The technology works by keeping an eye on the driver's eyes and sounding the warning while it dries. The system is a non-intrusive real-time control system. The main goal is to improve motorist safety without causing any disruption. The driver’s eyelid is identified in this experiment. When a motorist’s eyes are closed for a long time, the driver is regarded indifferent, and an alert sound. To detect facial features, the Haar Cascade library is utilized, and programming is done in OpenCV.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-7498-3_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The system serves two purposes. It simulates a real-world industrial setting and emphasizes the significance of experimental research to assess the feasibility of new ideas in real-world situations. The suggested simulation model has five rack systems with a total capacity of 1000 pallets. An AGV moves in the middle of each rack system, picking up and returning pallets to both sides in the direction of movement. A circulating conveyor system is used in the proposed system to enhance transaction count data to enable intelligent algorithms such as machine learning. Accordingly, each pallet (attached with one RFID tag) is managed by a management code when stored in the warehouse. After taking out, that pallet can be cleared of the old management code, assigned a new code, and returned to the input conveyor of the system. One of the biggest challenges of the proposed system is ensuring the continuous operation at the inlets of the AS/RS AGV’s pallet receiving conveyors. The feasibility was demonstrated by conducting the simulation to build a polynomial regression function from which the value of Tseparator can be attained according to the given set of values (Vconveyor and Tstoring). In addition, when the set of values (Vconveyor, Tstoring, and Tseparator) is known, the time required to store the entire inventory may also be calculated.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-03918-8_46,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These disasters are classified as either natural or man-made and have resulted in a negative impact on the economies all around the world. The governments of the world have been focusing on developing an integrated post-disaster management practice, which would help them in performing efficient operations whenever disasters occur. There are two major activities associated with handling disaster situations, namely, response and recovery operations. These operations need the acquisition of data and information about the disasters in real time. Due to the evolution of IP-based communication, the Internet of Things environment is well suited to perform data acquisition and transmission in real time. However, the smart devices may vary in their characteristics and operating efficiencies, thus requiring collaborative processing to be done among these devices. It needs a framework that supports the identification and integration of services offered by smart devices. Moreover, in the post-disaster scenarios, the deployment of devices is a critical challenge, which can be further aligned with the real-time localization of intelligent devices and events occurring in the region. In this context, this chapter discusses the concepts of layered IoT framework, a novel quasi-based deployment of nodes, and the need for localization of nodes and events to provide autonomous services using the Internet of Things for post-disaster management.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77528-5_20,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, the intersections (or junctions) are major hotspots of congestion, so to maintain a proper flow, traffic intersections are installed with traffic lights that control the flow of the traffic moving in a particular direction. Traffic lights were first used nearly a century ago, but there have not been any major advancements in the functioning of traffic lights that can cope up with the requirements of today’s traffic. Nowadays, due to a lack of optimization in the timings of traffic lights, they can further cause more delays and congestions which causes environmental issues (like increased CO 2 emissions and noise pollution), road rage, mental frustration, etc. This paper addresses the problem of traffic lights not having the optimized timings of signal for each direction due to the unavailability of robust, pro-active and real-time analysis of traffic and then analyzing and predicting the best timings of traffic lights based upon the size (small, medium, or large) and class (emergency and normal) of vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2347-0_43,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The continuously traffic data generated by these sensors makes traffic management feasible. However, loss of data may occur due to inevitable sensor failure, impeding traffic managers to understand traffic dynamics clearly. In this situation, it is becoming a necessity to predict missing traffic flow accurately for effective traffic management. Furthermore, the traffic sensor data are often distributed and stored by different agencies, which inhibits the multi-party sensor data sharing significantly due to privacy concerns. Therefore, it has become a major obstacle to balance the tradeoff between data sharing and vehicle privacy. In light of these challenges, we propose a privacy-aware and accurate missing traffic flow prediction approach based on time-aware Locality-Sensitive Hashing technique. At last, we deploy a set of experiments based on a real traffic dataset.

Moreover, collecting data for a long period can help to estimate the impact of the policies adopted to reduce air pollutant concentration in the air. The easiest and most cost-effective way to monitor air quality is by employing low-cost sensors distributed in urban areas. These sensors generate a real-time data stream that needs elaboration to generate adequate visualizations.

As a result of the IoT, it can now construct a smart world. For this to happen, however, extracting meaningful information from raw sensory input functioning in loud and complicated settings must be addressed to achieve it. For example, bandwidth, processing power, and power consumption must be addressed while building a possible IoT system. Due to the current epidemic, the need for contactless solutions has risen. Possible solutions include a gesture-based control system that protects user privacy and can operate several different appliances simultaneously. When implementing such gesture-based control systems, opaque box artificial intelligence (AI) models are used. This opaque box AI model has shown good performance metrics on in-distribution data when tested in a lab. However, their complexity and opaqueness make them prone to failure when exposed to real-world out-of-distribution input. In contrast to opaque box models, explainable AI models based on fuzzy logic (EAI-FL) demonstrate comparable performance on lab data distributions. The type-2 fuzzy models, on the other hand, are readily calibrated and modified to offer equivalent performance to those attained on the lab in-distribution data in the real world.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98404-5_57,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a low-power communications protocol specifically designed for the IoT ecosystem. In this protocol, the RF signals used to communicate between IoT end devices and a LoRaWAN gateway (GW) can be used for communication and localization simultaneously, using distinct approaches, such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). Typically, in a LoRaWAN network, different GWs are deployed in a wide area at distinct locations, contributing to different error sources as they experience a specific network geometry and particular environmental effects. Therefore, to improve the location estimation accuracy, the weather effect on each GW can be learned and evaluated separately to improve RSSI-based distance and location estimation. This work proposes an RSSI-based LoRaWAN location estimation method based on Edge-AI techniques, namely an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that will be running at each GW to learn and reduce weather effects on estimated distance. Results have shown that the proposed method can effectively improve the RSSI-based distance estimation accuracy between 6% and 49%, and therefore reduce the impact of the environmental changes in different GWs. This leads to a location estimation improvement of approximately 101 m.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06371-8_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the field of energy management, DTs are also starting to be considered as valuable analysis tools, as a digital twin facilitates real-time synchronisation between a real-world model (physical model) and its virtual copy for improved energy monitoring, prediction, and efficiency enhancement; thus, it can significantly reduce the overall energy consumption. A typical problem of DTs is the management of the data to be fed from the physical twin to the DT (and possibly the other way around), as one has to decide whether to store them within the DT or not, and one also has to decide whether to use different (depending on the data sources) or unified data governance models.

The main question is how to infer the optimal connectivity network considering the current structure of an urban area and time-varying traffic dynamics. Therefore a novel formulation is created in this paper to solve the optimization problem using available data. A proposed algorithm is presented to infer the optimal structure that is a distributed learning automata-based approach. A matrix called estimated optimal connectivity represents the favorite structure and it is optimized utilizing signals about the current system and traffic dynamics from the environment.

Despite such growth, no comprehensive guiding framework has been developed for emerging IoT and Blockchain technologies deployment in the smart campus environment, particularly in relation to security and privacy aspects, as well as to the mitigation of known problems with IoT and Blockchain in existing applications. This chapter proposes a novel architecture framework for the IoT and Blockchain applications deployed within a smart campus environment, comparing the main technologies involved. As a specific example, this framework is tested for integration of Blockchain and other relevant technologies into the higher education certificating system for issuing authentic, verifiable and sharable student credentials. The existing certificating systems are marked by their lack of speed and low reliability and, in certain educational systems, they produce social and cultural conflicts. The proposed Blockchain-based student certification system is aimed to address these existing problems. Specific higher education institutes in Saudi Arabia were used as a case study to present a certificate validation and sharing framework that guarantees authenticity through leveraging the privacy and security features of a Blockchain network. The proposed solution was validated with the user acceptance study. Two groups of participants, employers and academic users, with a majority of female respondents, were included in this empirical study focusing on the evaluation of the proposed framework, assessing the potential for Blockchain adoption in higher education. The validity and reliability of the framework was tested using a sequential mixed methods design involving the collection of qualitative interview data and quantitative survey data. The results of this study are particularly useful in the context of developing countries. It is expected that the proposed framework will have useful applications in a variety of fields, where it is necessary to determine whether a satisfactory level of IoT and Blockchain technologies has been achieved and maintained in accordance with the relevant safety and security standards.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-93344-9_1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we propose a framework for unknown traffic identification based on neural networks and constraint information to improve the clustering purity. The framework consists of two main innovations: (1) It uses neural network methods to reduce the dimensionality and select features of network traffic. (2) It analyzes the constraint information of traffic and uses this information to guide the process of identification. To verify the effectiveness of the framework in this paper, we make contrast experiments on two real-world packet traces respectively. Through our experimental results, we find that the maximum clustering purity of our framework in this paper can reach 96.10% on the traces of Internet Service Provider (ISP) and 91.89% on the public traces.

Unfortunately, the spoofing attack, a kind of cyber-risk, has increased the number of cyber-criminals in data transfer applications without being detected, especially in smart cities. Several applications based on online video communications, such as online testing and video conferences, are involved in smart cities. The video displays various variations of a person, which makes face recognition an important concept in security implementation. The face spoofing attacks are mainly based on the person's face replication by replaying a video or by printed photos. Therefore, video forgery detection and related spoof attack detection have become a new topic in cybersecurity research. From this perspective, this paper presents a deep learning approach for video face forensic detection with a cyber facial spoofing attack using two methodologies. The first methodology is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input video frames. The model has five convolutional layers followed by five pooling layers. The second methodology is based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). This model comprises two pooling layers, two convolutional layers, and a convolutional LSTM layer. Each methodology includes a fully-connected layer to interconnect between the feature map resulting from the feature extraction process and the classification layer. A SoftMax layer performs the classification task in each method. This paper aims to achieve an optimum modality for face forensic detection to overcome spoofing attacks. Simulation results reveal that the ConvLSTM with CNN methodology achieves better classification results as the extracted features are more comprehensive than those of other conventional approaches. Also, it achieves an accuracy of 99%, and the works presented in the literature achieve an accuracy levels up to 95%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06416-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Mostly, the location-based services (LBS) depend on both the present and future location of the user, which shows the increasing demand on predicting the user's future location. The prediction of trajectories among two different locations is very important as it aids to optimize travel paths among the locations. Moreover, existing techniques rely on high-quality data to deliver optimal results. In this research, we proposed a new optimized deep learning architecture for mobility tracing. The prediction model is based on Optimized DCNN (Deep Conventional Neural Network) that is already trained with the traced location of the user and from the user’s trained movement the model can predict its next location. For precise prediction, the weight and activation function of DCNN is optimally selected with the aid of HS-EH (Hybrid SeaLion -Elephant Herding) algorithm, which is a hybridization of Sea lion Optimization (SLnO) and Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO).

Fluctuations in these factors, as well as meteorological conditions, might result in output losses. As a result, controlling these variables becomes critical. Crop diseases have an equal impact on crop yield. To address these issues, a solution based on IoT and deep learning is proposed for improving paddy output. The system collects data through sensors and transfers it to the cloud in order to diagnose plant stress caused by soil fertility, environmental imbalance, and crop diseases (AWS EC2 Server).

In the proposed method, we perform two attacks, namely, the high degree link attacks and the recalculated high degree link attacks. These link attacks affect the core part of the network. To measure the extent of damaging the network at a greater portion, we use the closeness centrality and the eigenvector centrality. The goal is to construct a topology that shows better robustness against different malicious attacks with a minimum computational cost. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is used to select the measures that are positively correlated with each other. Based on these centrality measures, we optimize the network robustness for both node and link attacks simultaneously.

Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power is essential for power system dispatch. However, PV power output is greatly affected by weather conditions. Therefore integrating domain knowledge to improve power prediction accuracy has become a major challenge. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an effective deep learning model for solar power forecasting based on temporal correlation and meteorological knowledge. The model adopts an encoder-decoder architecture with multi-level attention machines and long short-term memory units. The encoder is designed to dynamically extract the historical features of the in situ measurements of the PV plant, whereas the decoder is used to capture the temporal features of multi-source variables. The domain knowledge (e.g., clearness index, numerical weather prediction, and short-wave radiation) is integrated into the decoder for forecasting solar PV power. A case study is conducted using the dataset collected from real-world PV plants in different weather conditions. The experiment results demonstrate that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model outperforms three baselines, and the prediction error is reduced by 9.5% on average compared to others.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10986-7_2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is always a possibility of having outliers within a dataset. Outliers are data that are usually so far away from data trend. Traditional data management systems are responsible for handling outliers, retrieving main data stream, and updating data precisely. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a new perspective in the information technology that includes all technical, social, and economic concepts. In this view, products, commodities, cars, trucks, industrial equipment, and various sensors are always connected via Internet. In the context of the Internet of Things, data management systems would receive giant amount of information continuously.

Hence, an emerging computing paradigm named edge computing addressed these issues by gracefully offering the services near the data sources to time-sensitive data. However, these services can have different computational requirements, and the capacities of edge servers also change dynamically. Therefore, many artificial intelligence (AI) based service placement algorithms have been proposed to counter these issues and improve QoS metrics.

Most of them are complex, computationally intensive, and time-sensitive applications such as workflow and machine learning tasks. The traditional cloud computing model is far away from the mobile terminal and thus cannot meet the stringent requirements of these applications on delay and energy consumption. As a new computing model, mobile edge computing can better solve the above problems. Mobile edge computing sinks part of the computing and storage resources in the cloud to the edge of the network close to the mobile device. With computational offloading, complex applications are offloaded to nearby edge servers for execution, which leads to low delay and energy consumption. The existing researches mainly focus on independent task offloading in mobile edge computing, and thus they are not suitable for workflow tasks offloading with dependence on mobile edge computing.

OLSR and DSDV are table-driven proactive routing protocol mainly developed for MANET which can also be extended for VANET. Finally, these three routing protocols are compared by quantitative metrics like an average throughput, packet delivery ratio and overhead and are evaluated using SUMO and NS-3. Simulation results show that AODV affords a realistic performance rather than OLSR and DSDV and acclimates well for highly dense vehicular networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-2123-9_55,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Despite that, deep learning managed to find its way into the IoT world by transferring heavy computational tasks to the cloud. Such systems require substantial data transfer between the IoT sensors and the cloud demanding huge bandwidth requirements. Edge computing facilitates the curtailment of the huge data transfer either by crunching down data from sensor nodes into simpler representations or by providing supplementary computational support to the cloud. In the literature, numerous IoT applications have been implemented using this paradigm. Various researchers have used different deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks, auto-encoders, etc., with the edge computing, and showed how the latency and the bandwidth required can be minimized in IoT applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of deep learning-based IoT applications in edge/fog integrated environments.

However, the prediction that considers some other factors as environmental and weather conditions are considered to be more accurate. Predicting traffic flow is a fascinating research area. To forecast traffic, several different data mining approaches are used. Existing traffic flow forecast approaches are mostly based on shallow traffic prediction methods, which are insufficient for many real-world applications. Since traffic flow shows both spatial and temporal dependency features, as well as being affected by weather, social event data, and other factors, therefore, a new deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction technique such as “Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long- and Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM)” is proposed in this paper, which considers both “Spatial and Temporal Correlations”.

AI can benefit various stages of real estate development, from planning and construction to occupation and demolition. However, Hong Kong's legal system is currently behind when it comes to technological abilities, while the field of AI safety in built environments is still in its infancy. Negligent design and production processes, irresponsible data management, questionable deployment, algorithm training, sensor design and/or manufacture, unforeseen consequences from multiple data inputs, and erroneous AI operation based on sensor or remote data can all lead to accidents. Yet, determining how legal rules should apply to liability for losses caused by AI systems takes time. Traditional product liability laws can apply for some systems, meaning that the manufacturer will bear responsibility for a malfunctioning part. That said, more complex cases will undoubtedly have to come before the courts to determine whether something unsafe should be the manufacturer's fault or the individual's fault, as well as who should receive the subsequent financial and/or non-financial compensation, etc. Since AI adoption has an inevitable relationship with safety concerns, this project intends to shed light on responsible AI development and usage, with a specific focus on AI safety laws, policies, and people's perceptions. We will conduct a systematic literature review via the PRISMA approach to study the academic perspectives of AI safety policies and laws and data-mining publicly available content on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit to study societal concerns about AI safety in built environments.

Formally, given a set of candidate sites S and existing sites E , the Optimal Site Selection (OSS) problem aims to find the optimal location $$s \in S$$ s ∈ S that serves maximum customers. In this paper, we study the OSS problem for predicting school location from a set of available sites in the Urban areas. We leverage deep neural networks to solve this problem in a resource and time-efficient way—using a dataset of 47,926 schools across 36 districts of the Punjab province. The dataset includes numerous features such as no. of teachers , no. of classrooms , and no. of sections associated with each school site. We also incorporate a novel feature called site influence that gives the expected number of potential students for a particular school. Our proposed model performs exceedingly well with the addition of this feature. We approach this problem by defining class labels based on a given school’s capacity—and further train a deep neural network using the aforementioned features to achieve accuracy values up to 82%.

To ensure the data security in the case of untrusted multiple parties sharing data and to improve users’ satisfaction with the use of digital assets in daily transactions, in this article, the digital twin technology is combined with the blockchain technology, and for multiple scenarios in blockchain networks, a credible and efficient edge computing resource allocation method is proposed based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) theory. The log storage system of the blockchain is mainly used as the interface for writing and reading data operation logs, and a hybrid storage strategy is put forward for the log storage system. As for the trusted resource allocation under the decentralized model of the blockchain network, to prevent the system from directly offloading the computing tasks submitted by the user each time to the edge server, first, the task is submitted to the system, and then a more reasonable resource allocation strategy is implemented with the user satisfaction as the standard. The simulation experiment results show that the improved environment after the introduction of the log storage system reduces the storage overhead by about 75% compared with the blockchain benchmark environment. When the number of servers is greater than 5, compared with other resource allocation algorithms, user satisfaction of the resource allocation algorithm based on DRL theory has been significantly improved, and compared with Q-learning algorithm, its user satisfaction has increased by 15%. In conclusion, the digital twins use credible source data as input.

Vehicle LP detection and recognition is the process of identifying and locating the LP from the vehicle and then extracting and recognizing the characters from this plate. Several academic studies have addressed the problem of LP detection and recognition and have proposed implementations with different performance indicators’ values. However, many of the current studies’ solutions are still not robust and efficient in complex real-world situations. In this paper, an automatic LP detection and recognition approach is proposed for the context of Saudi Arabia using Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The core of the proposed approach is to develop a sequence of Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster-RCNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The Faster-RCNN model is used for LP detection, whereas CNN is applied for characters’ recognition from LPs. The obtained experimental results prove the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A public transport network is widely used when it is safe, well designed and reliable. The development and maintenance of the urban transport are key items in city budgets. Decisions regarding changes and the future organization of the public transport are supported mainly by Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). There are many challenges, and one of them is the bus electro-mobility revolution. European leaders encourage a faster transformation to sustainable economy by introducing incentives and directives followed by EU funding. As a result cities replace aged fleets of diesel buses with the electric ones. A zero emission buses network is a new technology for public operators. It involves investments in chargers integrated to electric grids and the introduction of new maintenance processes. Each investment project that aims to introduce that innovative eco-friendly solution is preceded by feasibility studies.

After nearly a hundred years of experiences in fire protection, the concept of building’s fire protection of the so-called active fire protection design and passive fire protection design has gradually been reformed. With the development of high-speed computer technology and the improvement of modern science and technology, a new concept of the so-called performance-based fire protection design could be first traced down as early as 1970s when the goal-oriented approach to building fire safety was developed by the U.S. General Services Administration. The design concept uses the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software to obtain the movement data and the trace of fire and smoke, temperature distribution, gas concentration’s distribution cloud map, and other parameters. The emergence of this new technology enlarged the traditional prescriptive-based fire protection design approach with the alternative design method if code complaint approach does not fit the design best. The fire protection design of complex buildings can use this technology to perform the optimized design or justification / verification analysis quantitatively and obtaining more sound results and conclusions. However, the focus is still on how to fight and control the fire while preventing the fire as the second. With the new performance based design (PBD) method, the fire risk could be mapped and quantified in order to have a better weight in analysis toward a better fire and life safety tailored design. This could be even more achieved with the new tools including the information technology, Internet of Things, cloud computing, Big Data, and artificial intelligence. The PBD approach has been used in other engineering disciplines for longer time and approved to be a scientific based sound approach, with the new empowered information cutting-edge technology captioned above, fire protection design can take the advantages without leaving behind. ""Smart Building"" is a new thing that is being nurtured in the current era. It is a building that provides safety, efficiency, comfort, and consumes less energy for building, people, and environment by using computer technology and Internet technology. Under the ideal condition, smart buildings are supposed to be safe and the level of fire safety can meet people's expectations based on the reliable risk management tools. The implementation includes how to recognize the building features to identify the risk levels and areas, sending signals alerting the building’s brain for further diagnosis and action. The smart building concept is getting more and more attention with penetration and coordination of various engineering disciplines. The topics we are discussing in the chapter is aimed to be a food for thoughts making a better fire protection design and ultimately a better safer world.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98685-8_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To reduce the world wide spread of highly contagious viruses in the future, it is essential to target situations with a high risk for spreading contagious diseases. The risk of rapidly spreading of diseases is characterized by the fact that prevention measures cannot be applied as required, e.g., due to faulty execution. This situation has been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in passenger transportation, especially at airports. Air transportation enabled the rapid exchange of people to and from different locations, which may have contributed to the spread of the virus, especially at the beginning of the pandemic before hygiene measures and vaccines were available. It would be particularly interesting for airports to use innovative guidance and tracking strategies and assistance systems to allow people to travel further and react fast in circumstances similar to the one observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the challenges in preventing the uncontrolled spread of disease in air transportation of people and highlights the current state of the art. Furthermore, a new approach using technical systems is demonstrated and discussed in other scenarios, e.g., rail transport.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-05359-7_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the prior mobile crowdsensing system mostly employs centralized architecture, which is subject to low reliability and is vulnerable to malicious attacks. Furthermore, it is difficult to guarantee the privacy with the transparency of MCS systems. These factors have been a major hindrance to the growth of MCS applications. Hence, it is imperative to ensure security and privacy of such systems in order to meet the wide spectrum of its applications. So we propose a decentralized blockchain crowdsensing system to harness the benefits of this sensing paradigm. Our objective is to develop a decentralized crowdsensing system and meet the security and privacy requirements without affecting data sensing quality, achieving a trade-off between data quality and privacy preserving. We plan to integrate blockchain technology into the crowdsensing system. Meanwhile, we also focus on how to protect data privacy in blockchains to develop an accountable MCS system. By leveraging these technologies, we believe that MCS system will have a good performance in privacy protection and security enhancement.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-7952-0_53,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It has a straightforward interface that abstracts the complex internal structure of cloud computing resource usage and configuration. The fine grained pay-per-use model of serverless computing can dramatically reduce the cost of using cloud computing resources for users. Thus, today more and more traditional cloud applications are moving to the serverless architecture. In serverless computing, functions executing in containers are the basic unit of scheduling. However, the impact of resource allocation on function performance in serverless platform is still not clear. It is very challenging to improve the function performance while reducing the resource costs in serverless platform. In this paper, we select several typical workloads in serverless and analyze the function performance by controlling the CPU and memory resources.

In the past few years, IoT has drawn convincing ground in research fields range from academic and industrial fields, especially in healthcare. The IoT revolution reshapes contemporary healthcare systems by incorporate economic, social, and technological prospects. It progresses from conventional healthcare systems to more personalized healthcare systems, where patients can be monitored, diagnosed, and treated effortlessly. Wearable body sensor network has transformed the power to change our lifestyle with abundant technologies in areas of healthcare, entertainment, transportation, retail, business, and emergency services control. The integration of wireless sensors and sensor networks with simulation and intelligent systems research has developed an interdisciplinary definition of ambient intelligence to address the obstacles faced in our everyday lives.

This P2P network is generated and maintained by the participating peers in a distributed manner through peer discovery, neighbor selection and managing inbound/outbound connections. As these tasks require extra consumption of network bandwidth, energy, memory and CPU usage, resource-limited devices may not support inherent blockchain applications. Further, changes in the topology control functions or reconfiguration should be considered by all peers to fully benefit from the new performance, which can take time. The aim of this paper is to build a blockchain network in a manner that greatly reduce topology control overhead while guaranteeing the properties such as high flexibility, fast reconfigurability, connectivity, small diameter and clustering. For this, we propose to use the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to manage the blockchain P2P network. This way, the topology control tasks are moved off the peers to a secure overlay layer composed of multiple servers having synchronized databases. This new layer is responsible for building and managing the topological structure of the P2P network layer based on random r -out digraphs. Next, we mathematically discuss r -out digraphs generation using binomial distribution and preferential attachment models. Then, and in order to reduce the number of connections per peer, we establish lower and minimum upper bounds on outbound and inbound connections respectively that still guarantee the P2P network feasibility and connectivity. Further, we investigate topological properties of blockchain P2P network such as connectivity, diameter and clustering. Finally, we provide extensive simulation and numerical results to verify the efficiency of our approach and illustrate the effects of centralized topology control on network performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-021-01248-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Automated vehicles (AVs) have become central tools for such projects as city governments and industry explore the use and impact of this emerging technology. This paper presents a large-scale assessment of AV pilot projects in U.S. cities to understand how pilot projects are being used to examine the risks and benefits of AVs, how cities integrate these potentially transformative technologies into conventional policy and planning, and how and what they are learning about this technology and its future opportunities and risks. Through interviews with planning practitioners and document analysis, we demonstrate that the approaches cities take for AVs differ significantly, and often lack coherent policy goals. Key findings from this research include: (1) a disconnect between the goals of the pilot projects and a city’s transportation goals; (2) cities generally lack a long-term vision for how AVs fit into future mobility systems and how they might help address transportation goals; (3) an overemphasis of non-transportation benefits of AV pilots projects; (4) AV pilot projects exhibit a lack of policy learning and iteration; and (5) cities are not leveraging pilot projects for public benefits. Overall, urban and transportation planners and decision makers show a clear interest to discover how AVs can be used to address transportation challenges in their communities, but our research shows that while AV pilot projects purport to do this, while having numerous outcomes, they have limited value for informing transportation policy and planning questions around AVs.

It is affecting on average 7% of the world population. Preventing an asthma attack is the main challenge for asthma patients, which requires keeping track of any risk factor that can cause a seizure. Many researchers developed asthma attacks prediction models that used various asthma biosignals and environmental factors. These predictive models can help asthmatic patients predict asthma attacks in advance, and thus preventive measures can be taken. This paper introduces a review of these models to evaluate the used methods, model’s performance, and determine the need to improve research in this field. Method A systematic review was conducted for the research articles introducing asthma attack prediction models for children and adults. We searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, and IEEE databases from January 2000 to December 2020. The search includes the prediction models that used biosignal, environmental, and both risk factors. The research article’s quality was assessed and scored based on two checklists, the Checklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme clinical prediction rule checklist (CASP). The highest scored articles were selected to review. Result From 1068 research articles we reviewed, we found that most of the studies used asthma biosignal factors only for prediction, few of the studies used environmental factors, and limited studies used both of these factors. Fifteen different asthma attack predictive models were selected for this review. we found that most of the studies used traditional prediction methods, like Support Vector Machine and regression. We have identified the pros and cons of the reviewed asthma attack prediction models and propose solutions to advance the studies in this field. Conclusion Asthma attack predictive models become more significant when using both patient’s biosignal and environmental factors. There is a lack of utilizing advanced machine learning methods, like deep learning techniques. Besides, there is a need to build smart healthcare systems that provide patients with decision-making systems to identify risk and visualize high-risk regions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01704-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Particulate Matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM 2.5 ) is the most dangerous air pollutant invading the human respiratory system and causing lung and heart diseases. Therefore, innovative air pollution forecasting methods and systems are required to reduce such risk. To that end, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled system for monitoring and predicting PM 2.5 concentration on both edge devices and the cloud. This system employs a hybrid prediction architecture using several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms hosted by Nonlinear AutoRegression with eXogenous input (NARX). It uses the past 24 h of PM 2.5 , cumulated wind speed and cumulated rain hours to predict the next hour of PM 2.5 . This system was tested on a PC to evaluate cloud prediction and a Raspberry P i to evaluate edge devices’ prediction. Such a system is essential, responding quickly to air pollution in remote areas with low bandwidth or no internet connection. The performance of our system was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), Index of Agreement (IA), and duration in seconds. The obtained results highlighted that NARX/LSTM achieved the highest R 2 and IA and the least RMSE and NRMSE, outperforming other previously proposed deep learning hybrid algorithms.

Software effort and test prediction problems are common in software engineering and arise when seeking to determine the actual software resources needed to develop a project. BPNN is the most popular prediction algorithm used in the literature. The performance of BPNN depends totally on the initial parameter values such as weight and biases. The main objective of this paper is to integrate SSA with the BPNN to find the optimal weight for every training cycle and thereby improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method, abbreviated as SSA-BPNN, is tested on twelve SEP datasets and two STP datasets. All datasets vary in terms of complexity and size. The results obtained by SSA-BPNN are evaluated according to twelve performance measures: MSE, RMSE, RAE, RRSE, MAE, MRE, MMRE, MdMRE, VAF(%), R2(%), ED, and MD. First, the results obtained by BPNN with SSA (i.e., SSA-BPNN) and without SSA are compared. The evaluation of the results indicates that SSA-BPNN performs better than BPNN for all datasets. In the comparative evaluation, the results of SSA-BPNN are compared against thirteen state-of-the-art methods using the same SEP and STP problem datasets. The evaluation of the results reveals that the proposed method outperforms the comparative methods for almost all datasets, both SEP and STP, in the case of most performance measures.

It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including many deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social distancing classification of persons using thermal images. By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once) approach, a novel deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and to automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The proposed technique has been deployed in a low-cost embedded system ( Jetson Nano ) which is composed of a fixed camera.

With the growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), many non-intrusive sensing systems have been explored for various indoor applications, such as structural vibration sensing. This indirect sensing approach’s learning performance is prone to deployment variance when signals propagate through the environment. As a result, current systems heavily rely on expert knowledge and manual assessment to achieve effective deployments and high sensing task performance. In order to mitigate this expert effort, we propose to systematically study factors that reflect deployment environment characteristics and methods to measure them autonomously. We present AutoQual that measures a series of assessment factors (AFs) reflecting how the deployment environment impacts the system performance. AutoQual outputs a task-oriented sensing quality (TSQ) score by integrating measured AFs trained from known deployments as a prediction of untested system’s performance. In addition, AutoQual achieves this assessment without manual effort by leveraging co-located mobile sensing context to extract structural vibration signal for processing automatically. We evaluate AutoQual by using it to predict untested systems’ performance over multiple sensing tasks. We conduct real-world experiments and investigate 48 deployments in 11 environments. AutoQual achieves less than 0.10 average absolute error when auto-assessing multiple tasks at untested deployments, which shows a $$\le 0.018$$ ≤ 0.018 absolute error difference compared to the manual assessment approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42486-021-00073-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Instead of exclusively chasing complexity, Levins advocated for the use of multiple different kinds of complementary models, including much simpler ones. In this paper, I argue that the epistemic challenges Levins attributed to the brute force strategy still apply to state-of-the-art climate models today: they have big appetites for unattainable data, they are limited by computational tractability, and they are incomprehensible to the human modeller. Along the lines Levins described, this uncertainty generates a trade-off between realistic, precise models with predictive power and simple, highly idealised models that facilitate understanding. In addition to building ensembles of highly complex dynamical models, climate modellers can address model uncertainty by comparing models of different types, such as dynamical and data-driven models, and by systematically comparing models at different levels of what climate modellers call the model hierarchy. Despite its age, Levins’ paper remains incredibly insightful and should be considered an important entry into the philosophy of computational modelling.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-020-02707-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the fog ecosystem, it is essential to manage resources for different workloads due to the high volume and rapid growth of requests. Therefore, a challenge faced in this area is dynamic and efficient resource auto-scaling because fog resources must be allocated to requests efficiently. More fog resources than needed leads to “Over-Provisioning”, and fewer fog resources leads to the “Under-provisioning” issue. To this end, an effective deep learning-based resource auto-scaling mechanism has been proposed to manage the number of resources needed to handle dynamic workloads in a fog environment.

Originating from product engineering, the Digital Twin quickly advanced into other fields, including the life sciences and earth sciences. Digital Twins are seen by the tech sector as the new promising tool for efficiency and optimisation, while governmental agencies see it as a fruitful means for improving decision-making to meet sustainability goals. A striking example of the latter is the European Commission who wishes to delegate a significant role to Digital Twins in addressing climate change and supporting Green Deal policy. As Digital Twins give rise to high expectations, ambitions, and are being entrusted important societal roles, it is crucial to critically reflect on the nature of Digital Twins. In this article, we therefore philosophically reflect on Digital Twins by critically analysing dominant conceptualisations, the assumptions underlying them, and their normative implications. We dissect the concept and argue that a Digital Twin does not merely fulfil the role of being a representation, but is in fact a steering technique used to direct a physical entity towards certain goals by means of multiple representations. Currently, this steering seems mainly fuelled by a reductionist approach focused on efficiency and optimisation. However, this is not the only direction from which a Digital Twin can be thought and, consequently, designed and deployed. We therefore set an agenda based on a critical understanding of Digital Twins that helps to draw out their beneficial potential, while addressing their potential issues.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13347-021-00484-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This technique allows the automatic selection of specific regions of interest within the image by the generation of bounding boxes for gray colored moving objects. In the final step the convolutional neural network verifies the actual presence of smoke in the proposed regions of interest.

Due to the abundant natural resources it inherits, the resultant urbanization has led to an influx of the human population. This increase in population as a result of industrialization has led to increased municipal solid waste (MSW) accumulation. To address this exigent issue, which affects the nation’s carbon footprint, it is imperative to review socio-economic and geographic factors to establish a feasible approach for managing MSW efficiently and sustainably. In the quest to achieve the same, the present assessment focuses on the 3 core waste management hierarchy systems to support sustainable development for LC by reviewing existing opportunities and challenges associated with the current MSW management system and the associated policies. The result shows that as a sustainable approach to MSW management of LC, a zero-waste campaign for resource recovery engaging all stakeholders can be implemented since the organic content of MSW generated in LC is as high as 70%. Moreover, the dumping of MSW at the dedicated dumpsite site can be minimized if policies are strengthened and the proposed waste avoidance pathway is implemented strictly. In addition to this, to avoid the contamination of groundwater and recovery of methane, the use of the Fukuoka approach in the existing landfills has been suggested to capture leachate without any huge expenditure.

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design.

The problem is particularly acute for legacy systems and IoT devices. Legacy industrial control systems are not supported with periodic security patches leaving them susceptible to attack vectors published over the system life span. IoT devices, on the other hand, are thin devices with limited resources. This rules out many of the traditional heavy-duty software countermeasures for the IoT world. In this research, we deploy hardware/software solutions to detect CFI attacks. Many IoT devices are based on Raspberry Pi boards. These boards include ARM Cortex A-53 (Pi 3) or Cortex A-73 (Pi 4) processors. These ARM Cortex processors contain hardware counters that can be programmed to count microarchitecture level events such as branch mispredictions. Since control flow anomalies resulting from buffer overflow or return oriented programming (ROP) modify the program execution, the microarchitecture level events counts diverge. For instance, number of instructions issued per cycle could differ due to different instruction level parallelism. Hence, a vector of most discriminating hardware counters can flag control flow anomalies. This paper focuses on embedded programs. Embedded program behavior is dominated by the main event loops and task/event handlers, which can be measured with performance counters. Lighter weight IoT devices, based on ARM Cortex M4 or M7, include DWT (Debug, Watch and Trace) module, but not performance counters. DWT contains a much more limited set of counters. We show that DWT counters can also detect CFI anomalies with somewhat lower accuracy. For legacy software, we insert the performance counters instrumentation hooks with direct binary editing of ELF files. The proposed anomaly detection mechanism is evaluated on ArduPilot Team (2016)—a popular autopilot software on a Raspberry Pi 3 with PMU and DWT. A self-navigation program is evaluated on an iCreate Roomba platform with an ARM Cortex M4 processor which contains a DWT but not performance counters. We are able to achieve 97–99%+ accuracy with 1–10 $$\upmu$$ μ s time overhead per control flow anomaly check.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00915-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This “servicelization” across various domains has produced a huge volume of data, leading to the emergence of a new service model, called big service . This latter consists of the encapsulation, abstraction and the processing of big data, allowing then to hide their complexity. However, this promising approach still lacks management facilities and tools. Indeed, due to the highly dynamic and uncertain nature of their hosting cloud environments, big services together with their accessed data need continuous management operations, so that to maintain a moderate state and high quality of their execution. In this context, frameworks for designing, composing, executing and managing big services become a major need. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the new emerging big service model from the lifecycle management phases’ point of view.

The human civilization has lived with a pressing need to devise a method to quickly detect and safely transmit fire alerts to minimize losses. This work presents a novel framework for Blockchain and EdgeDrone based Secured Data Delivery for Forest Fire Surveillance (BESDDFFS). A detailed three-layer edge computing architecture is proposed consisting of IoT Layer (wireless network Drones deployed in the forest), the Edge Layer (a Local Processing and Routing Station located at the edge of the IoT network) and a Cloud Server communicating continuously with the Edge Layer. The integration of an edge computing paradigm within a Blockchain setting thereby attaining enhanced levels of security and performance is a defining attribute of this work. Extensive experimentation has been undertaken at software and hardware experimental setups to gauge the efficacy of the proposed architecture. An energy-efficient prospective Leader selection algorithm is proposed as energy conservation is a crucial issue in a resource-constrained wildfire IoT environment. Moreover, an optimal and dynamic drone trajectory algorithm is also proposed to minimize energy consumption. The proposed BESFFSS architecture is compared with baseline algorithms of state-of-the-art approaches. A detailed analysis of QoS parameters reveals that the proposed system achieves up to 66% lesser delay, 36% greater throughput and a 12% greater ratio of successfully delivered packets.

Nevertheless, the large demands for the computation and memory resources make these methods difficult to be deployed in the field as the resource-constrained IoT devices would be overwhelmed by the computations incurred by the inference operations of the deployed deep learning models. In this article, we propose the adaptive computation framework, which is built on top of the distributed deep neural networks (DDNNs), to facilitate the inference computations of a trained DDNN model to be collaboratively executed by the machines in a distributed computing hierarchy, e.g., the end device and the cloud server. By facilitating the trained models to be run on the actual distributed systems, the proposed framework enables the co-design of the distributed deep learning models and systems, since the delivered performance of the models on the systems, in terms of the inference time, consumed energy and model accuracy, is able to be measured and is served as the input for the next cycle for the model/system design. We have built the surveillance system for the object detection application with the prototyped framework. We use the surveillance system as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework. In addition, the design considerations of developing the DDNN system are shared. With the promising results presented in the article, we believe that the framework paves a road for the automated design process of the distributed deep learning models/systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-021-03795-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the meantime, various cyber-attacks for IoT have increased and caused huge losses. Lots of security mechanisms are rapidly being proposed to prevent the potentially malicious attackers for IoT, in which machine learning especially deep learning (DL) as increasingly popular solution for security has been implemented in intrusion detection system (IDS) and others. However, the lack of enough datasets prevents the application of IDS in 5G IoT system. As one of fundamental components of IDS, network traffic classification shows a discretization, individualization and fine-grained trend which derives the different personalized classification methods for different requirements and scenarios. In this case, the data-driven DL faces the following challenges. First, there are only a few labeled datasets in the various personalized application scenarios, which undoubtedly limits the deployment of DL classification. Second, not all scenarios have rich computing capability for that training a neural network requires lots of computing resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a traffic classification method based on deep transfer learning for 5G IoT scenarios with scarce labeled data and limited computing capability, and trains the classification model by weight transferring and neural network fine-tuning. Different from the previous work that extract artificially designed features, the proposed method retains the end-to-end learning performance of DL and reduces the risk of suffering concept drift to reduce human intervention. Experimental results show that when only 10% of dataset are used to label the data samples, the classification accuracy is close to the results of full training dataset.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13042-021-01415-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Along detecting user identity, it is also important to detect the devices at the hardware level. The trivial identity create-and-discard process at higher layers of the protocol stack alone is not sufficient to effectively counter security threats, such as masquerading and Sybil attacks. To counter these attacks, various radio frequency fingerprinting-based solutions are proposed for the identification of the devices. However, these approaches use expansive devices for signal capturing and rely on high sampling rates and large feature sets for analysis. In this paper, we propose a radio frequency fingerprinting-based device identification technique. The proposed technique is tested on 4G-LTE network for combined intra and inter-manufacturer device detection. It uses low-cost software defined radio to capture smartphone emissions at a lower sampling rate, using our proposed preamble threshold-based detection algorithm.

However, tracking a moving object requires the wireless sensors to perform high-frequency sensing and data transmission which consume much more energy. To save energy and prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks while tracking a moving object effectively, this paper proposes a framework that predicts the trajectory of the moving object using a Sequence-to-Sequence learning (Seq2Seq) model and only wakes-up the sensors that fall within the predicted trajectory of the moving object with a specially designed control packet. The framework uses DV-Hop (distance vector of hops to anchors) as the virtual coordinate that eliminates the dependency of using GPS to locate the sensors to be invoked for tracking the moving object. The framework translates the object’s moving trajectory to a sequence of cascaded hyperbolas and encodes the hyperbolas with DV-Hop constraints. A control packet containing these constraints forbid sensors not in the trajectory to rebroadcast, and awake/sleep signals that control the sensors’ action. The proposed Seq2Seq model predicts the target’s next trajectory directly and outputs a control message that could route along the predicted trajectory. In comparison to predicting the target’s trajectory then encoding the trajectory using geometric objects such as hyperbola, the proposed Seq2Seq model reduces the computation time of encoding geospatial trajectory. Also, the proposed framework preserves the location anonymity by only transmitting the hop’s information instead of GPS values. The performance comparisons with the existing methods show an improvement in energy-saving and control message routing delay.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-021-01157-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, achieving a high quality of service (QoS) and less energy consumption in MANETs remains a challenge owing to their ad hoc nature. To address these shortcomings, this paper designed a stable zone-based 5G clustered MANET environment. . The integration of the MANET with 5G communication aims to yield a high data rate while reducing the latency and cost. This study comprises four major processes, namely, the stable zone-based clustering, Grey-Dematel (GD) gateway selection, adaptive buffer management, and interest-region-based routing. Primarily, mobile nodes are gathered to form a stable cluster, which is vital in frequent topology-changing environments such as MANETs by strawberry optimization algorithm. A gateway is selected to provide 5G multimedia access to MANET users, and the GD algorithm is used to select an optimum gateway (5G user) from among the nearby 5G users of the current CH. The adaptive buffer management (ABM) method is used to reduce congestion in the CH node. ABM manages the buffer through adaptive time division multiple access scheduling, where video files are prioritized over audio/text files. Interest-region-based routing is performed among the users of MANET to reduce the delay and loss. Furthermore, the discrete interval type 2 improved fuzzy function algorithm is used to discover an optimum path in the interest region, which is formed by the angle between the source and destination. The proposed method is implemented using Network Simulator 3.26 (NS3.26).

This paper presents three novel versions of a hybrid method designed to assist in planning such paths for these robots. In this paper, an improvement on Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, namely Adapted-RRT, is presented that uses three well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Incremental Grey Wolf Optimization (I-GWO), and Expanded Grey Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). RRT variants, using these algorithms, are named Adapted-RRT GWO , Adapted-RRT I-GWO , and Adapted-RRT Ex-GWO . The most significant shortcoming of the methods in the original sampling-based algorithm is their inability in finding the optimal paths. On the other hand, the metaheuristic-based algorithms are disadvantaged as they demand a predetermined knowledge of intermediate stations. This study is novel in that it uses the advantages of sampling and metaheuristic methods while eliminating their shortcomings. In these methods, two important operations (length and direction of each movement) are defined that play an important role in selecting the next stations and generating an optimal path. They try to find solutions close to the optima without collision, while providing comparatively efficient execution time and space complexities. The proposed methods have been simulated employing four different maps for three unmanned aerial vehicles, with diverse sets of starting and ending points. The results have been compared among a total of 11 algorithms. The comparison of results shows that the proposed path planning methods generally outperform various algorithms, namely BPIB-RRT*, tGSRT, GWO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, PSO, Improved BA, and WOA.

To help LoRa network planners analyze the performance in terms of packet losses, and adjust communication parameters to improve reliability, a proper mathematical model is needed. In this paper, we develop a packet loss model that takes into account individual end devices’ packet arrival rates, transmission powers, and distances from a gateway. The derived model is applied to an optimization problem to find appropriate transmission powers in form of a linear program. Experiments show that packet loss probabilities predicted by the model mostly conform with the results from simulations and the model accurately predicts the aggregated interference, along with the expected loss rate, under moderate to heavy data traffic. In addition, the proposed optimization technique allows lowering the overall transmission powers while maintaining comparable signal-to-interference ratio and packet loss rate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00883-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In some applications, the UAVs need to perform certain monitoring tasks within a specified time. However, due to the energy constraints of UAVs, such tasks require using multiple UAVs to monitor multiple points. To solve this practical problem, this paper proposes a multi-UAV path planning model with the energy constraint (MUPPEC). The MUPPEC considers the energy consumption of a UAV in different states, such as acceleration, cruising speed, deceleration, and hovering, and the main objective of the MUPPEC is to minimize the total monitoring time. Also, a hybrid discrete intelligence algorithm based on the grey wolf optimizer (HDGWO) is proposed to solve the MUPPEC. In the HDGWO, the discrete grey wolf update operators are implemented, and the integer coding and greedy algorithms are used to transform between the grey wolf space and discrete problem space. Furthermore, the central position operation and stagnation compensation grey wolf update operation are introduced to improve the global convergence ability, and a two-opt with azimuth is designed to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the HDGWO can solve the MUPPEC effectively, and compared to the traditional grey wolf optimizer(GWO), the discrete operators and the two-opt local search strategy with azimuth can effectively improve the optimization ability of the GWO.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-021-01490-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Eventually, understanding the spatiotemporal variability of air pollution at high granularity is necessary to make relevant public policies. To explore spatiotemporal variability of air pollution at high granularity we have utilized the power of IoT based participatory sensing and data science. In this paper, we propose a predictive model for spatiotemporal air pollution estimation technique called Multiview data Fusion model (MVDF) that can consider spatial as well as temporal dependencies of air pollutants. The proposed technique is evaluated based on real-world air pollution dataset collected by participants over a period of 1 year in an urban area of city Kolkata. The results show that MVDF dominates over some baselines like Simple Kriging (SK), Modified Shepard’s Method (MSM) and Nearest Neighbor (NN).

However, existing crime studies focused on coarse-grained prediction, and usually failed to capture the dynamics of urban crimes. The key challenge is data sparsity, since that 1) not all crimes have been recorded, and 2) crimes usually occur with low frequency. In this paper, we propose an effective framework to predict fine-grained and dynamic crime risks in each road using heterogeneous urban data. First, to address the issue of unreported crimes, we propose a cross-aggregation soft-impute (CASI) method to deal with possible unreported crimes. Then, we use a novel crime risk measurement to capture the crime dynamics from the perspective of influence propagation, taking into consideration of both time-varying and location-varying risk propagation. Based on the dynamically calculated crime risks, we design contextual features (i.e., POI distributions, taxi mobility, demographic features) from various urban data sources, and propose a zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINBR) model to predict future crime risks in roads. The experiments using the real-world data from New York City show that our framework can accurately predict road crime risks, and outperform other baseline methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-021-0136-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, these devices increasingly include critical systems such as power grids and medical institutions, possibly causing tremendous consequences in the case of a successful cybersecurity attack. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is one of the main components to detect ongoing attacks by differentiating normal from malicious traffic. Anomaly-based NIDS, more specifically unsupervised methods previously proved promising for their ability to detect known as well as zero-day attacks without the need for a labeled dataset. Despite decades of development by researchers, anomaly-based NIDS are only rarely employed in real-world applications, most possibly due to the lack of generalization power of the proposed models. This article first evaluates four unsupervised machine learning methods on two recent datasets and then defines their generalization strength using a novel inter-dataset evaluation strategy estimating their adaptability. Results show that all models can present high classification scores on an individual dataset but fail to directly transfer those to a second unseen but related dataset. Specifically, the accuracy dropped on average 25.63% in an inter-dataset setting compared to the conventional evaluation approach.

Thus, AI in SF—science-fictional AI—is considered part of a larger corpus of ‘AI narratives’ that are analysed as shaping the fears and hopes of the technology. SF, however, is not a foresight or technology assessment, but tells dramas for a human audience. To make the drama work, AI is often portrayed as human-like or autonomous, regardless of the actual technological limitations. Taking science-fictional AI too literally, and even applying it to science communication, paints a distorted image of the technology's current potential and distracts from the real-world implications and risks of AI. These risks are not about humanoid robots or conscious machines, but about the scoring, nudging, discrimination, exploitation, and surveillance of humans by AI technologies through governments and corporations.

As a vital data form of sensor data, time series has three main types of anomaly: point anomaly, pattern anomaly, and sequence anomaly. In production environments, the analysis of pattern anomaly is the most rewarding one. However, the traditional processing model cloud computing is crippled in front of large amount of widely distributed data. This paper presents an edge-cloud collaboration architecture for pattern anomaly detection of time series. A task migration algorithm is developed to alleviate the problem of backlogged detection tasks at edge node. Besides, the detection tasks related to long-term correlation and short-term correlation in time series are allocated to cloud and edge node, respectively. A multi-dimensional feature representation scheme is devised to conduct efficient dimension reduction. Two key components of the feature representation trend identification and feature point extraction are elaborated.

It reduces the labor work, increases farms produce, enhances goods quality, and reduces farming time and cost-saving. However, the faults in the fuel system, blades, engine of the AM will often result in degraded vehicle performance, compromising the vehicle’s efficiency and strength. To overcome these problems, fault detection algorithms are developed to identify the faults even before they occur with high classification accuracy. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is a popular deep learning model that offers a high classification recognition rate, and it is widely adopted in similar fields for monitoring the health status of machines. Very few state-of-the-art works are available to identify the health state of agricultural machines using deep learning techniques and extracting the acoustic features from an audio recording. The acoustic signal-based agricultural machine health monitoring and fault prediction model using smartphones is a cost-effective option that is deployed in this proposed work. To optimize the network structure of the DCNN, this paper proposes a Levy flight optimization algorithm (LFOA). The DCNN-LFOA model is implemented on the smartphone’s on-board device (OBD) along with the health monitoring application. The LFOA algorithm minimizes the number of neurons in the DCNN hidden layer and the number of input features from the audio recordings and enhances the classification accuracy. The LFOA algorithm provides the optimal solution which is essential in developing a lightweight DCNN model to implement in the edge processor (smartphone). The experimental results prove that the proposed model gives improved accuracy for the six faults to be classified and serves as a new research model to identify the health condition of the vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-05892-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, resource-constrained robots, like low-power drones, often have insufficient on-board compute resources or power reserves to scalably run the most accurate, state-of-the art neural network compute models. Cloud robotics allows mobile robots the benefit of offloading compute to centralized servers if they are uncertain locally or want to run more accurate, compute-intensive models. However, cloud robotics comes with a key, often understated cost: communicating with the cloud over congested wireless networks may result in latency or loss of data. In fact, sending high data-rate video or LIDAR from multiple robots over congested networks can lead to prohibitive delay for real-time applications, which we measure experimentally. In this paper, we formulate a novel Robot Offloading Problem —how and when should robots offload sensing tasks, especially if they are uncertain, to improve accuracy while minimizing the cost of cloud communication? We formulate offloading as a sequential decision making problem for robots, and propose a solution using deep reinforcement learning. In both simulations and hardware experiments using state-of-the art vision DNNs, our offloading strategy improves vision task performance by between 1.3 and 2.3 $$\times $$ × of benchmark offloading strategies, allowing robots the potential to significantly transcend their on-board sensing accuracy but with limited cost of cloud communication.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-021-09987-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the internet of things (IoT) is becoming a part of our daily environments, and it generates a large volume of data, which is creating uncontrollable delays. For the delay-sensitive and context-aware services, these uncontrollable delays may cause low reliability and availability for applications. To overcome these challenges, computing paradigms are moving from centralized cloud environments to the Edge of the networks. Several new computing paradigms, such as Edge and Fog computing, emerged to support delay-sensitive and context-aware services. By combining edge devices, fog servers, and cloud computing, companies can build a hierarchical IoT infrastructure, using Edge–Fog–Cloud orchestrated architecture to improve IoT environments’ performance, reliability, and availability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on reliability and availability of Edge, Fog, and Cloud computing architectures. We first introduce and compare some related works about these paradigms and compare them to define the differences between Edge and Fog environments, since there is still some confusion about these terms. We also describe their taxonomy and how they link to each other. Finally, we draw some potential research directions that may help foster research efforts in this area.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40860-021-00154-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Our study draws on the exponential growth of renewable energy initiatives over the last decades and on the paucity of literature to illustrate the use of BDA in the energy industry. We conduct a qualitative field study in the UK with stakeholder interviews and analyse our results using thematic analysis. Our findings indicate that no matter if the importance of the energy sector for ‘people’s well-being, industrial competitiveness, and societal advancement, old fashioned approaches to analytics for organisational processes are currently applied widely within the energy sector. These are triggered by resistance to change and insufficient organisational knowledge about BDA, hindering innovation opportunities. Furthermore, for energy organisations to integrate BDA approaches, they need to deal with challenges such as training employees on BDA and the associated costs. Overall, our study provides insights from practitioners about adopting BDA innovations in the renewable energy sector to inform decision-makers and provide recommendations for future research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04263-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The attackers aim to paralyse the logical plane, the brain of the network that offers several advantages, by using the SDN controller. However, the control plane is the desirable target of security attacks on the opponents because of its characteristics. One of the most common threats is the DDOS attacks to drain network capacity by sending them heavy traffic, causing network congestion. SDN is a common area of investigation for SDN defenceand DDoS threat identification and prevention in the SDN context has been introduced to many researchers since the proposed SDN attacks. Nevertheless, security risks must be adequately secured. In this paper we suggest a discrete scalable memory based support vector machine algorithm for DDoS threat and SDN mitigation architecture for attack detection. By starting the process of attack detection the input data can gets pre-processed by using Spark standardization technique in which the missing values are replaced and the unwanted data are removed. Then the feature extractions are done using semantic multilinear component analysis algorithm. The classifier is responsible for predicting target and for this a novel discrete scalable memory based support vector machine (DSM-SVM) algorithm is used which provides high accuracy of attack prediction. Followed by attack detection the mitigation process was done, here the mitigation server can identify the threat by intelligently dropping malicious bot traffic and absorbing the rest of the traffic. Here the suggested mechanism achieves attack traffic mitigation and benign traffic dropping. We have evaluated the whole process on KDD dataset. The proposed network model was trained and then used in an SDN threat detection and mitigation environment as part of the assessment process. The entire experiment is run on a VMware-based Ubuntu virtual machine. Weka will utilize our suggested classifier model for training and evaluation, while Mininet uses a RYU controller to establish an SD Network. The findings demonstrate that the mechanism presented exceeds the other algorithms examined, by expressing 99.7% accuracy especially concerning training and testing time over KDD dataset.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-09071-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This work provides an assessment of these practical frameworks with the lens of known best practices for impact assessment and audit of technology. We review other historical uses of risk assessments and audits and create a typology that allows us to compare current AI ethics tools to Best Practices found in previous methodologies from technology, environment, privacy, finance and engineering. We analyse current AI ethics tools and their support for diverse stakeholders and components of the AI development and deployment lifecycle as well as the types of tools used to facilitate use.

Lightweight protocols, such as constrained application protocol (CoAP), have been widely utilised in transferring sensing data of medical devices to end-users in smart satellite-based healthcare IIoT networks (SmartSat-IIoHT). However, such protocols are extensively deployed without appropriate security configurations, making attackers’ mission easier for abusing these protocols to launch advanced cyber threats. This paper, therefore, presents a new threat intelligence framework to examine and model CoAP protocol’s attacks in these systems. We present a ransom denial of service (RDoS) as a new threat that would exploit this protocol’s vulnerabilities. We propose many RDoS attack’s techniques to understand the attack indicators and analyse their behaviour on systems. Moreover, we present a real-time discovery of attacks’ network behaviours using deep learning. The experiment results demonstrate that this proposed discovery model obtains a better performance in revealing RDoS than other conventional machine learning algorithms and accomplishing high fidelity of protecting SmartSat-IIoHT networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06441-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The rapid growth of M-IoT devices enables the creation of a massive volume of multimedia data with different characteristics and requirements. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based multimedia IoT systems have been recently designed and deployed for various video-based services for contemporary daily life, like video surveillance with high definition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) and mobile multimedia streaming. These new services need higher video quality in order to meet the quality of experience (QoE) required by the users. Versatile video coding (VVC) is the new video coding standard that achieves significant coding efficiency over its predecessor high-efficiency video coding (HEVC). Moreover, VVC can achieve up to 30% BD rate savings compared to HEVC. Inspired by the rapid advancements in deep learning, we propose in this paper a wide-activated squeeze-and-excitation deep convolutional neural network (WSE-DCNN) technique-based video quality enhancement for VVC. Therefore, we replace the conventional in-loop filtering in VVC by the proposed WSE-DCNN model that eliminates the compression artifacts in order to improve visual quality and hence increase the end user QoE. The obtained results prove that the proposed in-loop filtering technique achieves $$-2.85$$ - 2.85 %, $$-8.89$$ - 8.89 %, and $$-10.05$$ - 10.05 % BD rate reduction for luma and both chroma components under random access configuration.

It is a rapidly emerging paradigm that encompasses almost every aspect of our modern life, such as smart home, cars, and so on. With interest in IoT growing, we observe that the IoT discussions are becoming prevalent in online developer forums, such as Stack Overflow (SO). An understanding of such discussions can offer insights into the prevalence, popularity, and difficulty of various IoT topics. For this paper, we download a large number of SO posts that contain discussions about various IoT technologies. We apply topic modeling on the textual contents of the posts. We label the topics and categorize the topics into hierarchies. We analyze the popularity and difficulty of the topics. Our study offers several findings. First, IoT developers discuss a range of topics in SO related to Hardware, Software, Network, and Tutorials. Second, secure messaging using IoT devices from the Network category is the most prevalent topic, followed by scheduling of IoT script in the Software category. Third, all the topic categories are evolving rapidly in SO, i.e., new questions are being added more and more in SO about IoT tools and techniques. Fourth, the “How” type of questions are asked more across the three topic categories (Software, Network, and Hardware), although a large number of questions are also of the “What” type: IoT developers are using SO not only to discuss how to address a problem related to IoT, but also to learn what the different IoT techniques and tools offer. Fifth, topics related to data parsing and micro-controller configuration are the most popular. Sixth, topics related to multimedia streaming and Bluetooth are the most difficult. Our study findings have implications for all four different IoT stakeholders: tool builders, developers, educators, and researchers. For example, IoT developers and newcomers can use our findings on topic popularity to learn about popular IoT techniques. Educators and researchers can make more tutorials or develop new techniques to make difficult IoT topics easier. IoT tool builders can look at our identified topics and categories to learn about IoT developers’ preferences, which then can help them develop new tools or enhance their current offerings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10021-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This has created a demand to improve the productivity and product quality of companies and manufacturers. Besides, Smart Factories are expected to meet those requirements as consumers' needs are diversified, demanding personalized production and rapid and accurate manufacturing innovation rather than traditional manufacturing firms. The term “Smart Factory” means an intelligent factory that integrates ICT into the traditional manufacturing industry. This applies to the entire process of planning, requirement analysis, design, production, distribution, and sales. Smart Factory broadly covers level 4 areas that deal with general information technology (IT) and level 0–3 areas that deal with operational technology (OT). Thus, information covered in OT areas can cause problems not only for a company but also for its country if it is leaked to the outside world as a company’s core asset. Therefore, it is important to identify and respond to potential security threats in a Smart Factory environment.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) aims to manage and optimize the traffic congestion, road accidents, parking allocation using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) system, where the AVs are internally connected for message passing and critical decision making in time-sensitive applications. The data security in such applications can be offered using Blockchain (BC) technology. But, as per the existing literature, there exists no system which can call AVs automatically based on the situation, i.e., call an ambulance in case of an accident, call logistic service in case of home transfer, and call the traffic department in case of traffic jam. Motivated from the aforementioned reasons, in this article, we propose a BC-based secure and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for AV system using beyond 5G communication network. Recently, AVs are facing issues with sensing and tracking technology as well as the data thefts. AV system contains sensitive information and transfers it through a communication channel to Connected AVs (CAVs), where the corrupted information or delay of a fraction of a second can lead to a critical situation. So, here we present possib the attacks and safety countermeasures using BC technology to protect the AV system. The proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and tracking of an object through BC by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers. Also, the beyond 5G network enables communications with low latency and high reliability to meet the desires of the aforementioned time-sensitive applications. The proposed system is evaluated by considering the parameters as mobility and data transfer time against the traditional LTE-A and 5G communication networks.

In this paper, we present a novel health information sharing system viz., HonestChain that uses Blockchain technology to allow organizations to have incentive-based and trustworthy cooperation to either access or provide protected healthcare records. More specifically, we use a consortium Blockchain approach coupled with chatbot guided interfaces that allow data requesters to: (a) comply with data access standards, and (b) allow them to gain reputation in a consortium. We also propose a reputation scheme for creation and sustenance of the consortium with peers using Requester Reputation and Provider Reputation metrics. We evaluate HonestChain using Hyperledger Composer in a realistic simulation testbed on a public cloud infrastructure. Our results show that our HonestChain performs better than the state-of-the-art requester reputation schemes for data request handling, while choosing the most appropriate provider peers.

It is a matter of great concern for credit card users as well as financial institutions, providing credit card facilities for making the transactions free from possible frauds being carried out by fraudsters. The fraudsters apply different methodologies and alter their behaviours to undertake the fraudulent activities in both online and offline mode with some advanced techniques. Hence, developing a fraud detection system to identify the fraudulent activities is an important area of research to improve the credibility of credit card-based digital transactions. In this study, a fraud detection system has been proposed based on application of graph database model. The graph features being extracted using Neo4j tool are incorporated with several other features of transaction database. Subsequently, five supervised and two unsupervised machine learning algorithms are applied to them in order to detect fraudulent transactions explicitly. The features directly obtained from the transactional data are also tested with the classification models for detecting the fraudulent transactions. Critical assessment for performance of the machine learning algorithms has been carried out based on the features extracted from graph database and features extracted directly from the transaction database.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-021-05682-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It permits to protect a restricted area from intruders using a concentric circles model where simulated UAVs evolve in these so-called security rings. Having UAVs arranged in rings fosters an early detection (outer ring) while increases the reliability of the surveillance system featuring a last detection barrier (inner ring). Using the first return map from a chaotic attractor (an unpredictable sequence of real numbers) and a dynamic pheromone map, the UAV swarm members make a collective decision about their trajectories evaluating the options of a best-of- n problem. As a result, routes are unpredictable and detection rates are optimised. The parameters of each UAV, i.e. amount of pheromones and ring assignation, has been tuned using a specifically designed evolutionary algorithm.

The large-scale deployment of IoT based services is not conceivable without addressing interoperability and services coordination related challenges. In this regard, a comprehensive set of tools and techniques associated with IoT heterogeneity and interoperability have been explored. This article proposes a middleware framework to consider IoT heterogeneity and interoperability issues in different service interactions.

To ensure the confidentiality of data communication, it is crucial to authenticate remote users and establish session keys for IoD through the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Unfortunately, most existing AKA protocols using asymmetric cryptographic primitives are computationally expensive, and are unaffordable for the computing power limited drones. To this end, this paper presents an efficient three-factor AKA protocol for IoD based on FourQ and Boyko-Peinado-Venkatesan (BPV) pre-calculation. The detailed security analysis reveals that our protocol is secure against known attacks and achieves important security goals, especially perfect forward secrecy.

Storage volume requirements and computational costs are continuously rising in the conventional cloud-centric IoT structures. Besides, dependencies of the centralized server solution impose significant trust issues and make it vulnerable to security risks. In this paper, a layer-based distributed data storage design and implementation of a blockchain-enabled large-scale IoT system are proposed. It has been developed to mitigate the above-mentioned challenges by using the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) platform for distributed ledger solutions. The need for a centralized server and a third-party auditor was eliminated by leveraging HLF peers performing transaction verifications and records audits in a big data system with the help of blockchain technology. The HLF blockchain facilitates storing the lightweight verification tags on the blockchain ledger. In contrast, the actual metadata are stored in the off-chain big data system to reduce the communication overheads and enhance data integrity. Additionally, a prototype has been implemented on embedded hardware showing the feasibility of deploying the proposed solution in IoT edge computing and big data ecosystems. Finally, experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of its throughput, latency, communication, and computation costs. The obtained results have indicated the feasibility of the proposed solution to retrieve and store the provenance of large-scale IoT data within the Big Data ecosystem using the HLF blockchain. The experimental results show the throughput of about 600 transactions, 500 ms average response time, about 2–3% of the CPU consumption at the peer process and approximately 10–20% at the client node.

According to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software maintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart contract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are the current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the answers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature review to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from 2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from previous publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between academia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart contract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful responses.

OWC has been revolutionized to support fifth generation (5G) wireless communication and Internet-of-Things (IoT) terminals. In addition, OWC has no health hazard, low power consumption, unlicensed spectrum and shows immunity to interferences from electromagnetic sources. As RF and OWC are compatible, so a joint application scenario is referred as an excellent solution to support 5G and beyond systems. Hybrid optical/optical and RF/optical system is a promising approach to remove the limitations of each system as well as to enable supporting features of each technology. An optical/optical hybrid system is based on two or more OWC technologies while RF/optical hybrid system contains both RF and OWC technologies. The hybrid systems can enhance system performance in terms of energy efficiency, reliability and throughput of each system. Thus, hybrid RF/optical systems are envisioned as a key enabler to enhance user mobility and data rate on the one hand and to optimize power consumption, network load, interference and network capacity on the other hand. This survey seeks to provide the state-of-the-art and future research directions regarding optical wireless hybrid networks. This paper represents a technological overview of existing optical wireless hybrid networks. We have discussed optical-based free-space optics (FSO), optical camera communication (OCC), light fidelity (LiFi) which extends the concept of visible light communication (VLC) to attain bi-directional and fully networked wireless communication, as well as RF-based Bluetooth, wireless fidelity (WiFi), small cell, macrocell, mmWave and microwave. In addition, we have also considered underwater acoustic communication for acoustic/optical and acoustic/RF hybrid networks. An extensive range of applications such as indoor, vehicular communication, eHealth, backhaul connectivity solution and underwater communication is considered. We have addressed potential challenges and open research issues for design and successful deployment of hybrid wireless networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11082-021-03141-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The proposed model can predict the runtime for generic workloads as a function of the number of executors, without necessarily knowing how the algorithms were implemented. For a certain problem size, it is shown that a model based on serial boundaries for a 2D arrangement of executors can fit the empirical data for various workloads. The empirical data was obtained from a real Hadoop cluster, using Spark and HiBench. The workloads used in this work were included WordCount, SVM, Kmeans, PageRank and Graph (Nweight). A particular runtime pattern emerged when adding more executors to run a job. For some workloads, the runtime was longer with more executors added. This phenomenon is predicted with the new model of parallelisation. The resulting equation from the model explains certain performance patterns that do not fit Amdahl’s law predictions, nor Gustafson’s equation. The results show that the proposed model achieved the best fit with all workloads and most of the data sizes, using the R-squared metric for the accuracy of the fitting of empirical data. The proposed model has advantages over machine learning models due to its simplicity, requiring a smaller number of experiments to fit the data. This is very useful to practitioners in the area of Big Data because they can predict runtime of specific applications by analysing the logs. In this work, the model is limited to changes in the number of executors for a fixed problem size.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00499-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These networks depend upon the mobility of vehicular-relay nodes, which can adopt the store–carry–forward arrangement and provide consent to utilize their resources for packet forwarding. In reality, vehicular-relay nodes drop packets because of a lack of resources and selfish behavior, leading to potential failures in networks. The reason for this failure in performance is the absence of an efficient relay node selection strategy. Typically, vehicular delay networks can provide communication solutions in challenging conditions when other traditional networks fail to perform due to disconnection. However, if the routing strategy does not consider nodes’ selfish nature and relay nodes’ inefficiency, packet drops continue, and the approach will fail to perform. This paper proposes a routing strategy, known as the best-choice vehicular-relay selection strategy for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission, to overcome this breakdown situation. The proposed strategy selects the best-performing vehicular-relay nodes and restricts the packet replication to low-performing vehicular nodes. The proposed routing strategy selects the best-choice relay nodes based on their past performance. Numerical analysis and our simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms some of the leading routing strategies in its class by increasing the delivery probability, decreasing the overhead ratio, average latency, and the number of dropped packets in the vehicular network.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06106-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease and the only way to fight with it is to follow social distancing and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Moreover, this virus is increasing exponentially day-by-day and a huge amount of data from this disease is also generated at the fast pace. So, there is a need to store, manage, and analyze this huge amount of data efficiently to get meaningful insights from it, which further helps medical professionals to tackle this global pandemic situation. Moreover, this data is to be passed through an open channel, i.e., the Internet, which opens the doors for the intruders to perform some malicious activities. Blockchain (BC) emerges as a technology that can manage the data in an efficient, transparent manner and also preserve the privacy of all the stakeholders. It can also aid in transaction authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the adoption of BC to tackle COVID-19 situations.

Reliable monitoring of long-term continuous movement in indoor setting for detection of wandering movement is challenging because most elders are prone to forget to carry or wear sensors that collect motion information daily due to their declining memory. Wi-Fi as an emerging sensing modality has been widely used to monitor human indoor movement in a non-invasive manner. In order to continuously monitor individuals’ indoor motion and reliably identify wandering movement in a non-invasive manner, in this work, we develop a LSTM-based deep classification method that is able to differentiate the wandering-caused Wi-Fi signal change from the others. Specifically, we first use the off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices to capture a resident’s indoor motion information, enabling to collect a group of Wi-Fi signal streams, which will be split into variable-size segments. Second, the deep network LSTM is adopted to develop wandering detection method that is able to classify every variable-size segment of Wi-Fi signals into categories according to the well-known wandering spatiotemporal patterns.

By employing complex event processing (CEP) systems, valuable information can be extracted from raw data and used for further applications. CEP is a stream processing technology that matches atomic events to complex events via predefined rules mostly created by experts. However, especially in heterogeneous IoT environments, it may become extremely hard to define these rules manually due to complex and dynamic nature of data. Defining rules requires accurate knowledge of relevant events by utilizing temporal dependencies and relations among attributes of events. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic rule extraction system which is capable of generating rules automatically from unlabeled IoT data. This paper proposes a generalized framework for automatic CEP rule extraction with the help of deep learning (DL) methods. The proposed framework contains two main phases which are data labeling and automatic rule extraction phases. We compare several DL methods with each other and regression-based methods to evaluate the proposed framework. In addition, several rule mining methods are employed in the automatic rule extraction phase in a comparative manner. The reconstruction error and prediction success rate of our framework are evaluated using an air quality dataset collected from a smart city application.

In this paper, we investigate and leverage effective feature selection techniques to improve intrusion detection using machine learning methods. The proposed approach is based on a centralised intrusion detection system, which uses the deep feature abstraction, feature selection and classification to train the model for detecting the malicious and anomalous actions in the traffic. The deep feature abstraction uses deep learning techniques of artificial neural network in the form of unsupervised autoencoder to construct more features for the traffic. Based on the availability of cumulative features, the system then employs a variety of wrapper-based feature selection techniques ranging from SVM and decision tree to Naive Bayes for selecting high-ranked features, which are then combined and fed into an artificial neural network classifier for distinguishing attack and normal behaviors.

Nevertheless, its crucial challenge lies in how to model multiple complicated spatial dependencies between different regions, dynamic temporal laws among different time intervals with external factors such as holidays, events, and weather. Some existing work leverage the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore temporal relations and spatial relations, respectively; which have outperformed the classical statistical methods. However, it is difficult for these approaches to jointly model spatial and temporal correlations. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic deep hybrid spatio-temporal neural network namely DHSTNet, to predict traffic flows in every region of a city with high accuracy. In particular, our DSHTNet model comprises four properties i.e., closeness volume, daily volume, trend volume, and external branch, respectively. Moreover, the projected model dynamically assigns different weights to various branches and, then, integrate outputs of four properties to produce final prediction outcomes. The model has been evaluated, both for offline and online predictions, using an edge/fog infrastructure where training happens on the remote cloud and prediction occurs at the edge i.e. in the proximity of users. Extensive experiments and evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model, in terms of high accuracy over prevailing state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, we apply the exaggeration approach based on an attention mechanism to the above model, called as AAtt-DHSTNet; to predict citywide short-term traffic crowd flows; and show its notable performance in the traffic flows prediction. The aggregation method collects information from the related time series, remove redundancy and, thus, increases prediction speed and accuracy. Our empirical evaluation suggests that the AAtt-DHSTNet model is approximately 20.8% and 8.8% more accurate than the DHSTNet technique, for two different real-world traffic datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10486-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The spread of fire in enclosed compartments is a highly uncertain and nonlinear process. Hence, in safety-critical cases, any false negatives pose a serious threat to the safety of individuals such as firefighters that are engaged in rescue activities. This work aims to model the nonlinear fire spread behaviour as a temporal, deep learning-based regressive methodology. The objective is to efficiently identify abrupt and extreme temperature changes that often result in increases of 300+ °C. A major challenge in such time-series models is that of learning from historic time-series samples which are known to suffer from high noise levels, outliers and data imbalance. This work contributes on the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology to handle temperature data originating from body-mounted and fixed sensors and develop a temperature increase warning mechanism. The main contribution exploits the contextualisation ability of CNN-LSTM to predict temperature changes in windows of 5–120 s. The model identifies the spatial temperature change patterns via a CNN encoder, which are then fed into an LSTM network. This regression mechanism is trained and validated against a set of unique fire spread conditions and involved live tests ranging from containers to residential and industrial units. The model’s performance was evaluated with MAPE sensitivity analysis against data originating from body-mounted sensors and third-party NIST datasets.

However, due to the service uncertainties, including the network congestion and the performance degradation of edge nodes, novel offloading strategies must be developed to accommodate the uncertain situations. In view of this challenge, software-defined network (SDN) is integrated with edge computing to make service offloading more flexible. Technically, an optimal IoT service offloading (OSO) method with uncertainty is proposed. In OSO, the completion time and load balance variance are two optimization goals for developing offloading strategies, and then the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is fully investigated to improve the performance in completion time and load balance variance. Moreover, the optimal strategy is selected by using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) and Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDW).

The scheme, named as EVBlocks , facilitates ET among entities (i.e., EVs, charging stations (CS), and smart grids (SG)) in a secured and trusted manner through a consortium blockchain (CBC) network. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, to allow real-time and resilient network orchestration of V2X nodes, we consider the ET service designed over a fifth-generation (5G) enabled software-defined networking (SDN) environment. Integration of SDN in 5G-V2X ecosystems allows V2X nodes to eliminate intermediaries and handle many requests with a minimum response time. Then, in the second phase, a non-cooperative game is presented that optimizes a cost function and converges to reach at least one Nash equilibrium point. Finally, a consensus algorithm Proof-of-Greed (PoG) is proposed that handles fluctuations in charging/discharging EVs through an event-driven scheduling mechanism. The obtained results are compared against parameters, such as ET time, State-of-Charge (SoC) levels, EV utility, block-convergence time, profits, computation, and communication costs. For example, EVBlocks achieve an average SOC charge of 22.8 MW , with a peak at 377.5 MW , the average power dissipation of 4.1125  kWH that is lower than $$25\%$$ 25 % against existing conventional and fixed tariff schemes. The scheme converges at stable profit values for 5 EVs through a non-cooperative game. For proposed PoG consensus, the block convergence time for 1000 nodes is 138.96 seconds, at a computation cost of 46.92 milliseconds (ms) and communication cost of 149 bytes. The comparative analysis suggests the proposed scheme is efficient as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches against compared parameters.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-08732-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The efficiency of processes is “the sum of effort or input to generate the output of your company.” For example, if a single pack of gum requires 300 staff, the process efficiency is terrible. And they need to quit the production company for gum.

To overcome this problem, an end-to-end system called PotSpot is built for real-time detection, monitoring, and spatial mapping of potholes across the city A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed and evaluated on real-world dataset for pothole detection. Additionally, real-time pothole-marked maps are generated with the help of Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface).

Here, we generally describe the concepts of Industry 4.0, explain some new terminologies and challenges for clarity and completeness. The key of this paper is that we summarise over 14 countries’ up-to-date national strategies and plans for Industry 4.0. Some of them are bottom-up, such as Portugal, some top-down, such as Italy, a few like the United States had already been moving in this direction long before 2011.

These challenges are imposed mainly by the ultra-large scale of the IoT, the heterogeneous nature of applications and devices and the highly dynamic execution environment. The adoption of the microservices pattern combined with reactive systems principles may contribute to tackle some of these challenges. Therefore, the goal of this work is to propose an architecture based on reactive microservices for the development of IoT applications. The proposed architecture consists of a set of software components, tailored to meet the requirements of IoT applications. In addition, the proposal includes a software platform that materializes several of the architecture components and helps, at runtime, to meet the availability QoS requirement.

The smart electric grid is more than just a generation and transmission infrastructure. Modernizing such electric grids to automate the process of tracking the electricity consumption at multiple locations, while intelligently managing the supply is an exciting transformation, which offers both challenges as well as opportunities. Further, it must consider the change in prices with demand throughout the day. Advanced communication policy and intelligent sensing mechanism and decision making must be adapted to collect, monitor, and analyze real-time information, performing automatic metering, home automation, and inter-grid communication within vast geographical distance. In this paper, two crucial issues in the domain of smart grid management and communication have been addressed and the potential solution is provided. Firstly Delay Tolerant Network assisted the Internet of Drone Things based communication paradigm has been modeled for smart-grid communication in intermittent connective smart grid networks. The hybrid cluster-based 3D mobility has been engineered to that pursue the information sharing and offloading within IoT based cloud infrastructure. The routing mechanism results in 97% message delivery in 5 MB buffer size and about 8.5 × 10 6  J data transmission energy dissipation. In the latter half of this work, a load forecasting strategy is proposed, combining the mathematically robust gradient boosting strategies and a popular Deep Learning methodology, termed the Long Short-Term Memory approach. A hybrid architecture is developed for enhanced prediction in the presence of noise and faulty transmission of data from the physical layer.

To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose, investigate and compare four methods to reduce the ensemble complexity through adaptive de-activations of autoencoders. These methods differ in their approach to select the autoencoders to de-activate (criteria-based or random) and differ when they conduct the de-activations (post-training or in-training).

The network's growth due to scientific enrichment has altogether made it feasible to design a cross-layer protocol based on the energy-efficient network. This obviously concerns the prolonging of network lifetime. This research work attempts to introduce a novel Cross-Layer Design Routing model under the clustering approach. The implemented work depends on a cross-layer mechanism via diverse layers (comprising physical layer and network layer). A cluster-based routing is introduced, where the optimal cluster head is selected using a new hybrid algorithm named Alpha Wolf-assisted Whale Optimization Algorithm (AW-WOA). Thereby, the shortest path is defined and ensures the prolonging of network lifetime. The proposed hybrid algorithm is the hybridized form of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Moreover, the optimal cluster head selection is purely based on certain constraints like energy consumption, delay, and distance, respectively. In the end, the performance of the implemented technique is proved over other conventional approaches with regards to the alive node and network lifetime. In the alive node analysis of supernode, on considering the 1st test case, the presented AW-WOA model at 2000 rounds accomplishes 100% alive node than other existing models, wherein GWO and ATEER attain 91.67% and 75%, the other WOA, PSO, and AWOA ATEER attain 83.33% of alive nodes respectively.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-08154-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Incorporating all relevant factors into the model may be able to capture these changes, however, this is usually not practical. Data stream based methods, which instead explicitly detect concept drift, have been shown to retain performance under unknown changing conditions. These methods adapt to concept drift by training a model to classify each distinct data distribution. However, we hypothesize that existing methods do not robustly handle real-world tasks, leading to adaptation errors where context is misidentified. Adaptation errors may cause a system to use a model which does not fit the current data, reducing performance. We propose a novel repair algorithm to identify and correct errors in concept drift adaptation. Evaluation on synthetic data shows that our proposed AiRStream system has higher performance than baseline methods, while is also better at capturing the dynamics of the stream. Evaluation on an air quality inference task shows AiRStream provides increased real-world performance compared to eight baseline methods. A case study shows that AiRStream is able to build a robust model of environmental conditions over this task, allowing the adaptions made to concept drift to be analysed and related to changes in weather.

IoT devices are interconnected in heterogeneous networks, which have interference, and hardware–software interconnection problems. Cognitive radio (CR) that has connectivity to the Internet strengthens the concept of “Internet of Things”. Due to the diversification of applications, embedding the IoT technology with cognitive capability aids intelligence and improves the overall performance of the system. The Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) has emerged as an equipping technology, which focuses on the functions of CR and its potential contribution to IoT. The reason for deploying CR as the central device is to manage and provide an interface to different users. CR has the capabilities to implement artificial intelligence schemes to provide learning features and automatic reconfiguration. An attempt is made to design, and implement a preliminary step called sensing control layer which is the first step out of the framework of CIoT. Software-defined radio (SDR) has been used as the central unit whose function is to sense the spectrum and connect the IoT devices.

As such, they are full of contestations, conflicts, and contingencies that are not easily captured, steered, and predicted respectively. In short, they are characterized by wicked problems. Therefore, they are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer as to big data technologies and their novel applications in a bid to effectively tackle the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This paper analyzes and discusses the enabling role and innovative potential of urban computing and intelligence in the strategic, short-term, and joined-up planning of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. Further, it devises an innovative framework for urban intelligence and planning functions as an advanced form of decision support. This study expands on prior work done to develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. I argue that the fast-flowing torrent of urban data, coupled with its analytical power, is of crucial importance to the effective planning and efficient design of this integrated model of urbanism. This is enabled by the kind of data-driven and model-driven decision support systems associated with urban computing and intelligence. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in its essential technological and scientific components and the way in which these are coordinated and integrated given their clear synergies to enable urban intelligence and planning functions. These utilize, integrate, and harness complexity science, urban complexity theories, sustainability science, urban sustainability theories, urban science, data science, and data-intensive science in order to fashion powerful new forms of simulation models and optimization methods. These in turn generate optimal designs and solutions that improve sustainability, efficiency, resilience, equity, and life quality.

In this context, the novel combination of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and distributed intelligence (DI) is seen as a practical route towards the decentralisation of IoT architectures. This paper surveys DI techniques in IoT and commences by briefly explaining the need for DI, by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of DI in IoT. This taxonomy is then used to review existing techniques and to investigate current challenges that require careful attention and consideration. Based on the taxonomy, IoT DI techniques can be classified into five categories based on the factors that support distributed functionality and data acquisition: cloud-computing, mist-computing, distributed-ledger-technology, service-oriented-computing and hybrid. Existing techniques are compared and categorized mainly based on related challenges, and the level of intelligence supported. We evaluate more than thirty current research efforts in this area. We define many significant functionalities that should be supported by DI frameworks and solutions. Our work assists system architects and developers to select the correct low-level communication techniques in an integrated IoT-to-DLT-to-cloud system architecture. The benefits and shortcomings of different DI approaches are presented, which will inspire future work into automatic hybridization and adaptation of DI mechanisms.

This study, through a systematic literature review of 110 articles on HSC published between 2015 and 2020, provides a unified overview of the current state-of-the-art DTs adopted in HSC operations. The literature review findings substantiate the growing significance of DTs within HSC, identifying their main objectives and application domains, as well as their deployment with respect to the different HSC phases (i.e., Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery).

One of those problems is the classification of tweets due to use of sophisticated and complex language, which makes the current tools insufficient. We present our framework HTwitt, built on top of the Hadoop ecosystem, which consists of a MapReduce algorithm and a set of machine learning techniques embedded within a big data analytics platform to efficiently address the following problems: (1) traditional data processing techniques are inadequate to handle big data; (2) data preprocessing needs substantial manual effort; (3) domain knowledge is required before the classification; (4) semantic explanation is ignored. In this work, these challenges are overcome by using different algorithms combined with a Naïve Bayes classifier to ensure reliability and highly precise recommendations in virtualization and cloud environments. These features make HTwitt different from others in terms of having an effective and practical design for text classification in big data analytics. The main contribution of the paper is to propose a framework for building landslide early warning systems by pinpointing useful tweets and visualizing them along with the processed information. We demonstrate the results of the experiments which quantify the levels of overfitting in the training stage of the model using different sizes of real-world datasets in machine learning phases.

How to promote the acceptance of such novel technology is a heated research topic. Recent studies highlight the importance of providing local explanations about AI prediction and model performance to help users determine whether to trust AI’s predictions. Despite some efforts, limited empirical research has been conducted to quantitatively measure how AI explanations impact healthcare consumers’ perceptions of using patient-facing, AI-powered healthcare systems. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different AI explanations on people's perceptions of AI-powered healthcare system. In this work, we designed and deployed a large-scale experiment (N = 3,423) on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate the effects of AI explanations on people's perceptions in the context of comprehending radiology reports. We created four groups based on two factors—the extent of explanations for the prediction (High vs. Low Transparency) and the model performance (Good vs. Weak AI Model)—and randomly assigned participants to one of the four conditions. Participants were instructed to classify a radiology report as describing a normal or abnormal finding, followed by completing a post-study survey to indicate their perceptions of the AI tool. We found that revealing model performance information can promote people's trust and perceived usefulness of system outputs, while providing local explanations for the rationale of a prediction can promote understandability but not necessarily trust. We also found that when model performance is low, the more information the AI system discloses, the less people would trust the system. Lastly, whether human agrees with AI predictions or not and whether the AI prediction is correct or not could also influence the effect of AI explanations.

However, a decryption process is necessary when the data must be processed or analyzed, falling into the initial problem of data vulnerability. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is considered the holy grail of cryptography. It allows a non-trustworthy third-party resource to process encrypted information without disclosing confidential data. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental concepts of FHE, practical implementations, state-of-the-art approaches, limitations, advantages, disadvantages, potential applications, and development tools focusing on neural networks. In recent years, FHE development demonstrates remarkable progress. However, current literature in the homomorphic neural networks is almost exclusively addressed by practitioners looking for suitable implementations.

Out of these pollutants, C O 2 is one of the most dominant one. Hence, proper monitoring and control of this pollutant is an important part of maintaining a healthy indoor. To make this happen, it is required to predict the next moment’s indoor pollutant level at an acceptable accuracy range that ensures necessary steps can be taken beforehand to avoid a rise in the indoor pollution level for maintaining a healthy indoor all the time. It also helps people plan ahead, decreases the adverse effects on health and the costs associated. For this experiment, we have collected three months of real-life time-series data along with proper context information and have gone through feature engineering and feature selection process to create model ready data. Now, since the indoor C O 2 concentration is dependent on multiple external factors (context data) which in turn is dependent on time, makes it a time-dependent function.

This is a powerful tool and used in a wide range of research domains for predicting the next moment’s target value. This model ready data is utilized in forecasting different time series models.

This technology has the potential to radically transform the consumer experience, as it will change our daily scenes, starting from the way we drink coffee to how smart objects interact with industrial applications. Such rapid development and deployment face multifarious challenges, including the sheer amount of data generated, network scale, network heterogeneity, as well as security and privacy concerns. In recent years, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in IoT networks are considered one of the growing challenges that need to be shed light on. DDoS attacks utilize the limited resources in IoT devices, such as storage limitation and network capacity, that cause this issue in the IoT application. This paper comprehensively reviews the attacks that can lead to DDoS, which eventually will cause serious damage to existing systems. Additionally, the paper investigates the available solutions used to counter these attacks and explore their limitations from the perspective of the constrained device. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the existing solution placement was implemented, including heterogeneity and their performance for IoT based networks.

The proposed system inherits the advantages of CNN, CBR, and RL, which allow detection, prediction, control, evaluation, and learning in a unified framework. To assess the proposed TSCS, we compare our approach with a set of state-of-art algorithms (e.g., multi-agent preemptive case-based reasoning algorithm and multi-agent preemptive longest queue first—maximal weight matching).

At the recent years, there is large evolution in the industry of electric vehicles and in the near future, the normal vehicles may be replaced with electric vehicles. The energy consumption of these vehicles depends on the vehicle body size and weight, passengers' weight, mobility speed, and vehicle communications. In this paper, we focus only on vehicle communications and propose a new concept called Electrical Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (E-VANET). E-VANET is a new trend of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) which composes of connecting a group of electric vehicles with each other and with the infrastructure to exchange information. In addition to the challenges of VANET such as mobility, routing, location awareness, etc., the main challenge in E-VANET is energy consumption that needs a great research effort to be reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to highlight E-VANET and new concepts, standards, and technologies that can be used to enhance its performance and reduce energy consumption.

It is highly demanding an intelligent strategy to outline the precaution measures until the clinical trials find a successful vaccine. With technological advancement, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) has extended its significant role in the development of remote medical point-of-care (RM-PoC). WMSN is generally located on a communication device to sense the vital signaling information that may periodically be transmitted to remote intelligent pouch This modern remote system finds a suitable professional system to inspect the environment condition remotely in order to facilitate the intelligent process. In the past, the RM-PoC has gained more attention for the exploitation of real-time monitoring, treatment follow-up, and action report generation. Even though it has additional advantages in comparison with conventional systems, issues such as security and privacy are seriously considered to protect the modern system information over insecure public networks. Therefore, this study presents a novel Single User Sign-In (SUSI) Mechanism that makes certain of privacy preservation to ensure better protection of multimedia data. It can be achieved over the negotiation of a shared session-key to perform encryption or decryption of sensitive data during the authentication phase. To comply with key agreement properties such as appropriate mutual authentication and secure session key-agreement, a proposed system design is incorporated into the chaotic-map. The above assumption claims that it can not only achieve better security efficiencies but also can moderate the computation, communication, and storage cost of some intelligent systems as compared to elliptic-curve cryptography or RSA. Importantly, in order to offer untraceability and user anonymity, the RM-PoC acquires dynamic identities from proposed SUSI. Moreover, the security efficiencies of proposed SUSI are demonstrated using informal and formal analysis of the real-or-random (RoR) model. Lastly, a simulation study using NS3 is extensively conducted to analyze the communication metrics such as transmission delay, throughput rate, and packet delivery ratio that demonstrates the significance of the proposed SUSI scheme.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10134-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The infrastructure of a network that can support stringent application requirements needs to be highly dynamic and flexible. Network slicing can provide these dynamic and flexible characteristics to a network architecture. Implementing network slicing in 5G requires domain modification of the preexisting network architecture. A network slicing architecture is proposed for an existing 5G network with the aim of enhancing network dynamics and flexibility to support modern network applications. To enable network slicing in a 5G network, we established the virtualisation of the underlying physical 5G infrastructure by utilising technological advancements, such as software-defined networking and network function virtualisation. These virtual networks can fulfil the requirement of multiple use cases as required by creating slices of these virtual networks.

The extraction and fitting problems of lane markers from the road images have been addressed in recent research studies. However, these are still ineffective under curved lane and color light conditions. Illumination changes and the road structure mainly affect the efficiency of lane detection which may lead to traffic accidents especially in case of a curved road. In this work, a novel method based on a low complexity but efficient functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model is proposed to estimate the entire lane by interpolating the lane markers under different road scenarios. The road image is divided into regions and the extracted lane markers from each region are employed in the proposed trigonometric, polynomial, exponential, and Chebyshev functional expansion based FLANN models for the estimation of the lane curvature. The performance of each model is evaluated and tested on road images using three standard datasets. In terms of mean accuracy and computational time out of four FLANN models, the Chebyshev FLANN (CFLNN) outperforms other three proposed methods.

However, the traditional cloud data centres have their limitations to handle high latency issues in time-critical applications of IoT and cloud. Their applications are computer gaming, e-healthcare, telemedicine and robot surgery. The high latency in IoTs and cloud includes high computational, communication latency (service) and network latencies. The vital requirement of IoT is to have minimum network, service and computation latencies for real-time applications. Network latency causes a delay in transmitting a message or communication from one location to another. Services that require data in real-time are almost impossible to access the data via the cloud. Traditional cloud computing approaches are unable to fulfil the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in IoT devices. Researches related to latency reduction techniques are still in infancy. Some new approaches to minimize the latency for transmitting time-sensitive data in real-time are discussed in this paper for cloud and IoT devices. This research will help the researchers and industries to identify the techniques and technologies to minimize the latencies in IoT and cloud. The paper also discusses the research trends and the technical differences between the various technologies and techniques. With the increasing interest in the literature on latency minimization and its requirements for time-sensitive applications; it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges and techniques to minimize latencies in IoT and cloud. This paper aims at systematically reviewing the state of the art of latency minimization to classify approaches, and techniques. The paper uses a PRISMA technique for a systematic review.

In order to detect and prevent cyber attacks in IoT networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a crucial role. However, most of the existing IDS have dimensionality curse that reduces overall IoT systems efficiency. Hence, it is important to remove repetitive and irrelevant features while designing effective IDS. Motivated from aforementioned challenges, this paper presents an intelligent cyber attack detection system for IoT network using a novel hybrid feature reduced approach. This technique first performs feature ranking using correlation coefficient, random forest mean decrease accuracy and gain ratio to obtain three different feature sets. Then, features are combined using a suitably designed mechanism (AND operation), to obtain single optimized feature set. Finally, the obtained reduced feature set is fed to three well-known machine learning algorithms such as random forest, K-nearest neighbor and XGBoost for detection of cyber attacks. The efficiency of the proposed cyber attack detection framework is evaluated using NSL-KDD and two latest IoT-based datasets namely, BoT-IoT and DS2OS. Performance of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with some recent state-of-the-art techniques found in literature, in terms of accuracy, detection rate (DR), precision and F1 score. Performance analysis using these three datasets shows that the proposed model has achieved DR up to 90%–100%, for most of the attack vectors that has close similarity to normal behaviors and accuracy above 99%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-020-05181-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Intelligent algorithms crucial in building intelligent systems are good candidates for building a reliable and convenient monitoring system. To analyze water quality, we need to understand, model, and monitor the water pollution in real time using different online water quality sensors through an Internet of things framework. However, many water quality parameters cannot be easily measured online due to several reasons such as high-cost sensors, low sampling rate, multiple processing stages by few heterogeneous sensors, the requirement of frequent cleaning and calibration, and spatial and application dependency among different water bodies. A soft sensor is an efficient and convenient alternative approach for water quality monitoring. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based soft sensor model to estimate biological oxygen demand (BOD), a time-consuming and challenging process to measure. We also propose a system architecture for implementing the soft sensor both on the cloud and edge layers, so that the edge device can make adaptive decisions in real time by monitoring the quality of water. A comparative study between the computational performance of edge and cloud nodes in terms of prediction accuracy, learning time, and decision time for different machine learning (ML) algorithms is also presented.

It requires advanced approaches for creating more agile, adaptable, sustainable and intelligent information systems. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been used in significant performance-based approaches by information system practitioners. Organizations are interested in performance-based decision support along the layers of SOA to maintain their sustainability for service reuse. Reusability is a very important aspect of Service-based systems (SBS) to analyze service or process reuse. This helps in achieving business agility to meet changing marketplace needs. However currently, there are many challenges pertaining tothe complexities of service reuse evolution along SBS. These challenges are related to the sustainability of service behavior during its lifecycle and the limitations of existing monitoring tools. There is a need for a consolidated classified knowledge-based performance profile, analytical assessment, prediction and recommendation. Therefore, this paper provides a semantic performance-oriented decision support system (SPODSS) for SOA. SPODSS provides recommendations for suggesting service reuse during its evolution. SPODSS is supported by five building blocks. These blocks are data, semantic, traces, machine learning, and decision. SPODSS classify data, validate (analytical assessment, traces, semantic enrichment) at different time intervals and increased consumption and prediction based on consolidated results. It handles the dynamic evolution of SBS and new or changed user requirements by ontology development. Finally, SPODSS generates recommendations for atomic service, composite service, and resourceallocation provisioning. To motivate this approach, we illustrate the implementation of the proposed algorithms for all the five blocks by a business process use case and public data set repositories of shared services.

In manufacturing, the cross-linking of embedded systems creates adaptive and self-organizing Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). Owing to ever-increasing cross-linking, rapid technological advances, and multifunctionality, the complexity and structural opacity of CPPSs are rapidly increasing. The development of urgently needed modeling approaches for managing such complexity and structural opacity, however, is impeded by a lack of common understanding of CPPSs. Therefore, in this paper, we contribute to a common understanding of CPPSs by defining and classifying CPPS entities and illustrating their relations. More precisely, we present a terminology, a taxonomy, and a reference model for CPPS entities, created and evaluated using an iterative development process. Thereby, we lay the foundation for future CPPS modeling approaches that make CPPS complexity and structural opacity more manageable.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-019-09952-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These devices are quite vulnerable to malware attacks. Existing studies have worked on designing complex learning algorithms or deep architectures to accurately classify malware assuming that a sufficient number of labeled examples are provided. In the real world, getting labeled examples is one of the major issues for training any classification algorithm. Recent advances have allowed researchers to use active learning strategies that are trained on a handful of labeled examples to perform the classification task, but they are based on the selection of informative instances. This study integrates the Q-learning characteristics into an active learning framework, which allows the network to either request or predict a label during the training process. We proposed the use of phase space embedding, sparse autoencoder, and LSTM with the action-value function to classify malware applications while using a handful of labeled examples. The network relies on its uncertainty to either request or predict a label. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better accuracy than the supervised learning strategy while using few labeled requests. The results also show that the trained network is resilient to the adversarial attacks, which proves the robustness of the proposed method. Additionally, this study explores the tradeoff between classification accuracy and number of label requests via the choice of rewards and the use of decision-level fusion strategies to boost the classification performance. Furthermore, we also provide a hypothetical framework as an implication of the proposed method.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10371-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Among these techniques, particle swarm optimisation based algorithms stand out as prominent techniques with fast convergence and accurate network inferences. A multi-objective approach for the inference of GRNs consists of optimising a given network’s topology while tuning the kinetic order parameters in an S-System, thus preventing the use of unnecessary penalty weights and enables the adoption of Pareto optimality based algorithms. In this study, we empirically assess the behaviour of a set of multi-objective particle swarm optimisers based on different archiving and leader selection strategies in the scope of the inference of GRNs. The main goal is to provide system biologists with experimental evidence about which optimisation technique performs with higher success for the inference of consistent GRNs. The experiments conducted involve time-series datasets of gene expression taken from the DREAM3/4 standard benchmarks, as well as in vivo datasets from IRMA and Melanoma cancer samples.

Given the current dependency on traditional transportation data sources and conventional tools (e.g., spreadsheets and propriety models), how can these new resources be used? This research examines a “blended data” approach, using a web-based, open source platform to assist transit agencies to forecast bus ridership. The platform is capable of incorporating new Big Data sources and traditional data sources, using modern processing techniques and tools, particularly Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This research demonstrates the use of APIs in a transit demand methodology that yields a robust model for bus ridership. The approach uses the Census Transportation Planning Products data, modified with American Community Survey data, to generate origin–destination tables for bus trips in a designated market area. Microsimulation models us a transit scheduling specification (General Transit Feed Specification) and an open source routing engine (OpenTripPlanner). Local farebox data validates the microsimulation models. Analyses of model output and farebox data for the Atlantic City transit market area, and a scenario analysis of service reduction in the Princeton/Trenton transit market area, illustrate the use a “blended approach” for bus ridership forecasting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-019-10073-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This flourishing field of research is profoundly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in nature. It operates out of the understanding that advances in knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. This implies that the research problems within the field of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism are inherently too complex and dynamic to be addressed by single disciplines. As this field is not a specific direction of research, it does not have a unitary disciplinary framework in terms of a uniform set of the academic and scientific disciplines from which the underlying theories can be drawn. These theories constitute a unified foundation for the practice of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary framework. With that in regard, this paper identifies, describes, discusses, evaluates, and thematically organizes the core academic and scientific disciplines underlying the field of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. This work provides an important lens through which to understand the set of established and emerging disciplines that have high integration, fusion, and application potential for informing the processes and practices of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism. As such, it provides fertile insights into the core foundational principles of data-driven smart sustainable urbanism as an applied domain in terms of its scientific, technological, and computational strands.

Worldwide, we are witnessing the deployment of several IoT networks for different applications, spanning from home automation to smart cities. The majority of these IoT deployments were quickly set up with the aim of providing connectivity without deeply engineering the infrastructure to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. The interest is now moving towards the analysis of the behavior of such systems in order to characterize and improve their functionality. In these IoT systems, many data related to device and human interactions are stored in databases, as well as IoT information related to the network level (wireless or wired) is gathered by the network operators. In this paper, we provide a systematic approach to process network data gathered from a wide area IoT wireless platform based on LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). Our study can be used for profiling IoT devices, in order to group them according to their characteristics, as well as detecting network anomalies. Specifically, we use the k -means algorithm to group LoRaWAN packets according to their radio and network behavior. We tested our approach on a real LoRaWAN network where the entire captured traffic is stored in a proprietary database. Quite important is the fact that LoRaWAN captures, via the wireless interface, packets of multiple operators. Indeed our analysis was performed on 997, 183 packets with 2169 devices involved and only a subset of them were known by the considered operator, meaning that an operator cannot control the whole behavior of the system but on the contrary has to observe it.

In destination islands that have a delicate ecosystem to maintain, this source of income can become problematic in terms of sustainability. A difficulty in making people aware of this issue is also represented by the fact that such sustainability-related issues (and their causes) are often not “visible” to citizens. To foster awareness about the relationship between sustainability and tourism in well-known destinations, we design a platform that engages users at two levels of participation: i. at the IoT and sensors level, in order to let them becoming providers of big data, deploying and enlarging the pervasive infrastructure; ii. at the (big) data visualization level, with the aim of engaging them in making sense of large volumes of data related to sustainability. This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-world experience where a low-cost collaborative platform made it possible to sense and visualize tourist flows and urban data into a rich interactive map-based visualization, open to the local communities. We deployed our case study in the Madeira archipelago, engaging locals and visitors of the island in two exploratory studies focused on measuring the impact of providing users with meaningful representations of tourism flows and related unperceivable aspects that affect the environmental sustainability. Analysing the findings of the two studies, we discuss the potentiality of using such a system to make sense of big data, fostering awareness about sustainability issues, and we point to future open challenges about citizens’ participation in sensing and making sense of big data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00442-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, there has been a growing curiosity in the IoT field and this leads to the concept of IoT ecosystem. But the contemporary fragmented ecosystem of regulations, technologies, and systems slows IoT deployments. Thus, we consider multi-tiered computational infrastructure which would be feasible to provide services from the nearest possible location of end devices. To mitigate multi-tier infrastructure issues, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) steps in. The journey behind SDN-supported multi-tier computational infrastructure can be understood from this paper’s elaborate study. Next, a comparative analysis on dew, roof, fog and cloud is conducted and the impact of internet on these computing paradigms is briefly explained.

As it is very essential to automatically collect and exploit information in the era of industry 4.0, a variety of models have been proposed for storage problem solving and efficient data mining. In this paper, we present our proposed system, Trendy Keyword Extraction System (TKES), which is designed for extracting trendy keywords from text streams. The system also supports storing, analyzing, and visualizing documents coming from text streams. The system first automatically collects daily articles, then it ranks the importance of keywords by calculating keywords’ frequency of existence in order to find trendy keywords by using the Burst Detection Algorithm which is proposed in this paper based on the idea of Kleinberg. This method is used for detecting bursts. A burst is defined as a period of time when a keyword is continuously and unusually popular over the text stream and the identification of bursts is known as burst detection procedure. The results from user requests could be displayed visually. Furthermore, we create a method in order to find a trendy keyword set which is defined as a set of keywords that belong to the same burst.

The causation of OO and T2D is complex and highly multifactorial rather than a mere energy intake (food) and expenditure (exercise) imbalance. But previous research into food and physical activity (PA) neighbourhood environments has mainly focused on associating body mass index (BMI) with proximity to stores selling fresh fruits and vegetables or fast food restaurants and takeaways, or with neighbourhood walkability factors and access to green spaces or public gym facilities, making largely naive, crude and inconsistent assumptions and conclusions that are far from the spirit of 'precision and accuracy public health'. Different people and population groups respond differently to the same food and PA environments, due to a myriad of unique individual and population group factors (genetic/epigenetic, metabolic, dietary and lifestyle habits, health literacy profiles, screen viewing times, stress levels, sleep patterns, environmental air and noise pollution levels, etc.) and their complex interplays with each other and with local food and PA settings. Furthermore, the same food store or fast food outlet can often sell or serve both healthy and non-healthy options/portions, so a simple binary classification into 'good' or 'bad' store/outlet should be avoided. Moreover, appropriate physical exercise, whilst essential for good health and disease prevention, is not very effective for weight maintenance or loss (especially when solely relied upon), and cannot offset the effects of a bad diet. The research we should be doing in the third decade of the twenty-first century should use a systems thinking approach, helped by recent advances in sensors, big data and related technologies, to investigate and consider all these factors in our quest to design better targeted and more effective public health interventions for OO and T2D control and prevention.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12942-021-00266-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Hence we need to explore other approaches to integration for IoT platforms. In this paper we cover both these aspects: (1) we explore several emerging data management challenges, and (2) we propose an IoT platform integration model that can combine disparate functionalities under one roof. For the first, we focus on the following challenges: sensor data quality, privacy in data streams, machine learning model management, and resource-aware data management.

The model revolves around the concept of a Data-Sharing Market where data management functionalities can share and exchange information about their data with other functionalities.

At first, we split the whole research scope into four parts from bottom to up, where the four parts are, respectively, spatio-temporal data, preprocessing, traffic prediction and traffic application. Later, we review existing work on the four parts. First, we summarize traffic data into five types according to their difference on spatial and temporal dimensions.

Optimising the usage of natural resources is one of the challenges this sector faces. For this reason, it could be necessary to locally monitor weather data and soil conditions to make faster and better decisions locally adapted to the crop. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can serve as a monitoring system for these types of parameters. However, in WSNs, sensor nodes suffer from limited energy resources. The process of sending a large amount of data from the nodes to the sink results in high energy consumption at the sensor node and significant use of network bandwidth, which reduces the lifetime of the overall network and increases the number of costly interference. Data reduction is one of the solutions for this kind of challenges. In this paper, data correlation is investigated and combined with a data prediction technique in order to avoid sending data that could be retrieved mathematically in the objective to reduce the energy consumed by sensor nodes and the bandwidth occupation. This data reduction technique relies on the observation of the variation of every monitored parameter as well as the degree of correlation between different parameters. This approach is validated through simulations on MATLAB using real meteorological data-sets from Weather-Underground sensor network. The results show the validity of our approach which reduces the amount of data by a percentage up to 88% while maintaining the accuracy of the information having a standard deviation of 2 $$^{\circ }$$ ∘ for the temperature and 7% for the humidity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-020-00864-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional networks are experiencing exponential increases in data volume, velocity, and variety. With the intermingling of IoT devices and legacy systems, new security threats are becoming more prevalent and severe. Successful attacks can cause significant damage or disruption to critical infrastructures or theft of private data through previously nonexistent attack vectors. In response, existing security solutions must be adapted, or new countermeasures must be created to address the unique threats presented by IoT. Therefore, we propose the Blacksite framework for a novel adaptive real-time intrusion detection in IoT networks using human intelligence integrated into an artificial immune system with deep neural network–based validation model. We recommend a solution that can address unique challenges of IoT networks and present implementation strategies as well as a pilot implementation of the core component (deep neural network model for malicious traffic classification) of Blacksite.

In the SG environment, only efficient energy management may not be sufficient as the SG dynamics have significant impacts on multimedia communications such as video surveillance of the technical/non-technical losses of energy and many more. The inevitable energy losses can be identified by process and analyze the massive amount of heterogeneous data, i.e., Big Data (BD) generated through smart devices such as sensors, Smart Meters (SMs), and others. The key challenges in analyzing multimedia BD are computational complexity, operational integration complexity, data security, and privacy. To overcome the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based data analytics scheme called ChoIce , which offers secure data collection, analysis, and decision support for the SG systems.

AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective? Methods Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. Results Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusions The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00577-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Consequently, traditional implementation of monitoring and security mechanisms cannot always be presently feasible and adequate due to the number of IoT devices, their heterogeneity and the typical limitations of their technical specifications. In this paper, we propose an IP flow-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework to monitor and protect IoT networks from external and internal threats in real-time. The proposed framework collects IP flows from an IoT network and analyses them in order to monitor and detect attacks, intrusions, and other types of anomalies at different IoT architecture layers based on some flow features instead of using packet headers fields and their payload. The proposed framework was designed to consider both the IoT network architecture and other IoT contextual characteristics such as scalability, heterogeneity, interoperability, and the minimization of the use of IoT networks resources. The proposed IDS framework is network-based and relies on a hybrid architecture, as it involves both centralized analysis and distributed data collection components. In terms of detection method, the framework uses a specification-based approach drawn on normal traffic specifications. The experimental results show that this framework can achieve ≈ 100% success and 0% of false positives in detection of intrusions and anomalies. In terms of performance and scalability in the operation of the IDS components, we study and compare it with three different conventional IDS (Snort, Suricata, and Zeek) and the results demonstrate that the proposed solution can consume fewer computational resources (CPU, RAM, and persistent memory) when compared to those conventional IDS.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03238-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The different behavioral patterns of smart home’s inhabitants are exploited to distinguish the residents. The variation of a specific individual behavior in smart homes is a significant challenge. We introduce different features that are useful to handle this problem. Moreover, we introduce an innovative strategy which considers the Bag of Sensor Events and Bayesian networks. In the Bag of Sensor Events approach, the frequency of each sensor event occurrence is considered, regardless of the order of sensor events. The efficiency of the Bag of sensor Events approach is compared to the Sequence of Sensor Events . Our experiments confirm that the Bag of Sensor Events approach outperformed the previous approaches. When the smart homes residents are people who repeat their daily activities frequently, applying the Bag of Sensor Events on Activity Based Window Frame features, which considers the performed daily activities, would identify them more accurately. In contrast, in cases where residents perform their activities in different ways, considering the Time Based Window Frame leads to higher accuracy in distinguishing residents. In this approach, the features are created by considering the constant time intervals.

One of the major challenges in IoT health is security. For this reason, regarding the past studies, there is a lack of a comprehensive security framework that encompasses all layers of IoT. This article offers a security framework with four layers of sensor, network, service, and application. These layers help to develop security mechanisms within the proposed framework by providing security solutions. Also, security improvement has been influenced by the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. To evaluate this framework, a conceptual model was defined with six critical criteria including security, network, services, interoperability, privacy, and reliability. The validity and reliability of this conceptual model were analyzed using SPSS 24 and AMOS 18. After proving the important criteria in the proposed model, we used the MCDM process of fuzzy analytic network process to prioritize the important criteria. The evaluation results of the conceptual model in the proposed framework, after analyzing the routes, show the validity of the proposed criteria. Therefore, in this model, 8 out of 12 communication routes between the criteria have a positive and significant relationship and 4 routes do not. The results of prioritizing important criteria in the research model, using analytic network process method, show that the network criterion, and authentication and validation sub-criteria have the highest priority among the proposed criteria. Thus, it can be decided that security solutions in the network layer and authentication and validation sub-criteria help to develop the proposed security framework.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02472-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These qualitative factors are very salient to modern distributed systems in which components and their collaboration often vary. Survivability of such systems can be best addressed from an architectural viewpoint. When it comes to maintainability and reliability, architectural level adaptation is not often supported during the design phase. Adaptation to fault tolerance into the design phase of the system development process can increase the scope of software availability and thereby attaining self-healing. In distributed systems, most of the existing architectures are often associated with communication and correspondence as primary criteria. On the other hand, a multi-agent mechanism helps in schematic control of functionality, communication by emphasizing scalability. In this paper, a novel architecture was proposed that could support agent-based distributed systems to address fault recovery aspects for achieving self-adaptiveness. Unlike traditional multi-agent architecture, task-oriented functional multi-agent communication is incorporated for various activities during design phase designated to perform self-healing criteria. An adaptation of agent communication control flow is proposed using three novel mechanism such as planning, functioning and enacting as agents’ critical responsibility. The paper also validates the proposed architecture for resource and availability based faults related to crash and resource unavailability using performance-based evaluation metrics. A case-based application with single thread connectivity is used to reflect the architecture during application design phase and is tested for success using mean response time as evaluation metric.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02443-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) become an important component of the IoT and is the major source of big data. In IoT enabled WSN, a massive amount of data collection generated from a resource-limited network is a tedious process, posing several challenging issues. Traditional networking protocols offer unfeasible mechanisms for large-scaled networks and might be applied to IoT platform without any modifications. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a revolutionary archetype which that can resolve those big data gathering challenges. Employing the ICN architecture for resource-limited WSN enabled IoT networks may additionally enhance the data access mechanism, reliability challenges in case of a mobility event, and maximum delay under multihop communication. In this view, this paper proposes an IoT enabled cluster based routing (CBR) protocol for information centric wireless sensor networks (ICWSN), named CBR-ICWSN. The proposed model undergoes a black widow optimization (BWO) based clustering technique to select the optimal set of cluster heads (CHs) effectively. Besides, the CBR-ICWSN technique involves an oppositional artificial bee colony (OABC) based routing process for optimal selection of paths. A series of simulations take place to verify the performance of the CBR-ICWSN technique and the results are examined under several aspects. The experimental outcome of the CBR-ICWSN technique has outperformed the compared methods interms of network lifetime and energy efficiency.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-08088-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to plethora of events occurring over EBSNs and varying user interests and preferences with time, finding appropriate events to attend has become an important challenge in EBSNs. Accurate event recommendation will improve relevance of ESBNs to participants and event organizers. EBSNs have recognized the importance of recommender systems and are actively using different types of recommendation techniques to make suitable suggestions to participants and organizers of events. In this paper, a novel event recommendation system (i.e., IoTCFR- IoT data and collaborative filtering-based recommendation) is proposed. In order to suggest an event where the chance of user’s participation is high, the proposed approach combines IoT data, collaborative filtering (CF) approach, and social influence. Initially, the prediction score for both IoT-based parameters and CF based on social influencers is calculated for each candidate event. Then, the final event with highest prediction score is presented to the user. Furthermore, in order to verify the accuracy of proposed system, several experiments on real-world datasets were conducted. The results clearly indicate that recommendation quality of IoTCFR system is better, when compared to its variants and other baseline methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13278-021-00722-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data because acquiring data involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming. This has triggered a serious debate in both the industrial and academic communities calling for more data-efficient models that harness the power of artificial learners while achieving good results with less training data and in particular less human supervision. In light of this debate, this work investigates the issue of algorithms’ data hungriness. First, it surveys the issue from different perspectives. Then, it presents a comprehensive review of existing data-efficient methods and systematizes them into four categories. Specifically, the survey covers solution strategies that handle data-efficiency by (i) using non-supervised algorithms that are, by nature, more data-efficient, by (ii) creating artificially more data, by (iii) transferring knowledge from rich-data domains into poor-data domains, or by (iv) altering data-hungry algorithms to reduce their dependency upon the amount of samples, in a way they can perform well in small samples regime. Each strategy is extensively reviewed and discussed. In addition, the emphasis is put on how the four strategies interplay with each other in order to motivate exploration of more robust and data-efficient algorithms. Finally, the survey delineates the limitations, discusses research challenges, and suggests future opportunities to advance the research on data-efficiency in machine learning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00419-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Network softwarization enables the operation of new computational elements such as base stations and access points at the MEC, whereas edge computing, network control and storage promise to enable computation-intensive and latency-critical applications for resource constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we employ a novel disaggregated 5G architecture and apply a semantic-based coordination approach from the network edge. We consider semantics as the key enabling principle for the implementation of spectrum coordination schemes addressing the coexistence of heterogeneous technologies at the edge of 5G HetUDN wireless networks. A Semantic-based Framework for dynamic Spectrum Coordination (SFSC) deployed according to the MEC approach is proposed dealing with agile complex system resource management.

This intelligence then, at least as a goal, is used to serve the needs of the citizens better, making the everyday operations more efficient and adaptive. Many recent successes of supervised machine learning make it an auspicious tool; however, the long-term vision of smart cities clearly requires technology that goes beyond that. The data collected based on the current operation of the system does not in itself contain information about possible improvements. The next generation of smart cities undoubtedly lies with the systems that build towards autonomous and semi-autonomous “knowledge creation.” They can self-improve and adapt to changing conditions and expectations. They must handle situations that were not anticipated during their design. Such construction of knowledge can be illustrated with the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom hierarchy.

Smart data can be used in a variety of smart city applications, but difficulties in managing such data are pushing smart cities toward the adoption of data management frameworks. Many studies have brought into focus the importance of these frameworks as they combine data collection, processing, analysis, management, and visualization and provide privacy and security features for different smart city applications, i.e., transportation, to promote a better quality of life. This chapter highlights key components of the data management framework, reviews various smart city applications, and discusses privacy and security challenges associated with smart city data. From the perspective of data frameworks, it is seen that the data used in smart city applications is unstructured coming from heterogeneous sources, i.e., sensors and social media, besides others. Therefore, the collection, processing, analysis, management, and visualization of such data are challenging. To perform these tasks, recent technologies, i.e., Internet of Things (IoT), sensor networks, machine learning, etc., have been used.

One promising technology for smart environment monitoring is the radar-based moving object tracking and classification. Radar-based technology is known to provide better solutions compared to vision-based systems as the latter is prone to the adverse effects of lighting and weather conditions. Radars operating in mm-wave range are preferred due to small size, good angular resolution, small apertures, and low cost. The signature waveform received from the moving object is used to estimate the range and the velocity of multiple targets based on Doppler drift. Also, the micro-Doppler effect on the return signal that occurs due to the micromotion dynamics such as vibrations or rotations can be used to identify the specific type of the target.

One alternative is to use edge computing that keeps the data in situ and brings the applications in close proximity to the data (i.e., at the network edge) so as to reduce the communication cost, lower the bandwidth and latency, and also, adds a layer of security to the data. A paradigm that complements cloud computing and benefits each other is Edge Computing.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60265-9_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Applied Data Science Track,10.1007/978-3-030-86514-6_5,Springer,2021-01-01,"With the increased demand for connected and autonomous vehicles, vehicle platoons will play a significant role in the near future, enhancing traffic efficiency and safety. However, their reliance on wireless communication channels makes such systems susceptible to a range of cyber-attacks. An intelligent adversary could target the platoon through message falsification between vehicles to carry out high-impact attacks. This would create persistent degradation of platoon stability or even cause catastrophic collisions. In this paper, we present a novel, end-to-end attack detection and mitigation framework. We use a deep neural network as an example anomaly detector tuned to reduce false alarm rate. We then model the interactions between the imperfect detector, the intelligent adversary and the defense system as a non-cooperative security game with imperfect information. In this setting, the adversary performs a test-time boiling frog attack against the detector. The Nash-equilibrium solution considers the downstream effects of the test-time attack, to guide the control system reconfiguration for the vehicles to mitigate communication-based attacks. The simulations conducted in a sophisticated simulator demonstrate the potential for real-world online deployment in a distributed manner. Results show that our approach outperforms baseline methods by up to $$30\%$$ 30 % in terms of increase of defense utilities, leading up to $$176\%$$ 176 % increase in minimum inter-vehicle distances for collision avoidance under attacks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86514-6_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Today, these gadgets are often mobile devices, but in the advent of smart cities, more and more infrastructure—such as traffic and buildings—in our surroundings becomes intelligent. The intelligence, however, does not emerge by itself. Instead, we need both design techniques to create intelligent systems, as well as approaches to validate their correct behavior. An example of intelligent systems that could benefit smart cities are self-driving vehicles. Self-driving vehicles are continuously becoming both commercially available and common on roads. Accidents involving self-driving vehicles, however, have raised concerns about their reliability. Due to these concerns, the safety of self-driving vehicles should be thoroughly tested before they can be released into traffic. To ensure that self-driving vehicles encounter all possible scenarios, several millions of hours of testing must be carried out; therefore, testing self-driving vehicles in the real world is impractical. There is also the issue that testing self-driving vehicles directly in the traffic poses a potential safety hazard to human drivers. To tackle this challenge, validation frameworks for testing self-driving vehicles in simulated scenarios are being developed by academia and industry. In this chapter, we briefly introduce self-driving vehicles and give an overview of validation frameworks for testing them in a simulated environment. We conclude by discussing what an ideal validation framework at the state of the art should be and what could benefit validation frameworks for self-driving vehicles in the future.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60922-1_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To maintain the security of ICSs from cyber-attacks, they were placed on isolated communication networks, where they were relatively obscure and unknown to most attackers. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in ICSs opens up the possibility of remote monitoring, access, and control of the critical infrastructure (CI), leading to more agile and efficient systems. This is called the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, this integration increases the vulnerabilities of ICS towards cyber-attacks. Due to the IIoT and ICS environment, a compromise in the system may lead to severe danger to human life or the environment. The growing number of cyber-attacks against IIoT in recent years elevates a significant concern for proper and timely security solutions for these systems.

In automotive industry, Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) gain considerable attention as it is one of the important constituents of IoTs. There are different scenarios with different network requirements to be considered in IoVs. For instance, safety messages require low latency network, while on the other hand, infotainment services demand high bandwidth network. For such various requirements, the network should be able to allocate appropriate resources to accomplish the desired service. One of the promising technologies that is leveraged to fulfil such goal is Network Slicing. With network slicing, the underlying infrastructure is divided into multiple slices each equipped with required resources to meet specific need. To slice the network, the infrastructure should be controllable in a way that allow a central unit to guide the slicing process. For this purpose, Software-defined Networking (SDN) is utilised to decouple the control plane from the data plane, allowing a separate unit to take control. In this chapter, we discuss vehicular SDN slicing and how to boost it with intelligent capabilities using recent advances in machine and deep learning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76493-7_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These cities aim to increase the quality of life for its citizens, making living in an urban space more attractive, livelier, and greener. In order to accomplish these goals, physical sensors are deployed throughout the city to oversee numerous features such as environmental parameters, traffic, and the resource consumption. However, this concept lacks the human dimension within an urban context, not reflecting how humans perceive their environment and the city’s services. In this context there is a need to consider sentiment analysis within a smart city as a key element toward coherent decision making, since it is important not only to assess what people are doing, but also, why they are behaving in a certain way. In this sense, this work aims to assemble tools and methods that can collect, analyze and share information, based on User Generated spatial Content and Open Source Geospatial Science. The emotional states of citizens were sensed through social media data sources (Twitter), by extracting features (location, user profile information and tweet content by using the Twitter Streaming API) and applying machine learning techniques, such as natural language processing (Tweepy 3.0, Python library), text analysis and computational linguistics (Textblob, Python library). With this approach we are capable to map abstract concepts like sentiment while linking both quantitative and qualitative analysis in human geography. This work would lead to understand and evaluate the “immaterial” and emotional dimension of the city and its spatial expression, where location-based social networks, can be established as pivotal geospatial data sources revealing the pulse of the city.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58232-6_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The crop productivity and drought predictions is very important to the farmers and agriculture’s executives, which greatly help agriculture-affected countries around the world. Drought prediction plays a significant role in drought early warning to mitigate its impacts on crop productivity, drought prediction research aims to enhance our understanding of the physical mechanism of drought and improve predictability skill by taking full advantage of sources of predictability. In this work, an intelligent method based on the blend of a wrapper feature selection approach, and PART classification technique is proposed for crop productivity and drought predicting. Five datasets are used for estimating the proposed method. The results indicated that the projected method is robust, accurate, and precise to classify and predict crop productivity and drought in comparison with the existing techniques. From the results, the proposed method proved to be most accurate in providing drought prediction as well as the productivity of crops like Bajra, Soybean, Jowar, and Sugarcane. The WPART method attains the maximum accuracy compared to the existing supreme standard algorithms, it is obtained up to 92.51%, 96.77%, 98.04%, 96.12%, and 98.15% for the five datasets for drought classification, and crop productivity respectively.

Energy requirement of each consumer can be predicted with the available data. Renewable energy generation can also be predicted. In this paper, different statistical and machine learning models are used to analyze the energy usage in smart communities. To validate the prediction models, smart meter data from our campus is used. The results show that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is more suitable for energy demand prediction.

However, the education system of students in Portugal have enhanced during the past decades. Precisely, the inadequate achievement of success in critical courses like the Portuguese language and also Mathematics is a grave issue. In this paper, we intend to analyze student’s success in tertiary institutions using ML techniques. Real-world raw data were received by using existing data from the school. The two core courses were modeled, also four ML techniques were tested. The results gotten shows that student success rates can greatly be instigated by their previous performance.

Both scenarios can be considered under UAV-enabled IoT networks. Potential applications of the UAV-enabled IoT networks include, but not limited to, building smart cities, crowd surveillance, emergency disaster assistance, agricultural application, airborne sensing, etc. The ongoing development of wireless communications such as 4G/5G technologies has facilitated UAV-to-UAV or UAV to IoT communication more than ever before. Despite having many advantages of these UAV-enabled IoT networks, there are several challenges too. Selecting the appropriate communication system based on wireless channel conditions, optimal deployment of UAVs and IoT devices, security, privacy and ensuring public safety can be cited as examples. In addition, UAVs with on-board IoT have limited battery supplies to transmit and receive information which leads to lower life span of these airborne sensing UAV-enabled IoT systems.

CPS is the integration of computational objects in fitting together with the corporal biosphere and its procedures. CPSs are complicated manufacturing systems with the goal to combine and harmonize mechanism biosphere and industrial capability to the cyber computational space. Nevertheless, having thorough interconnectivity and a computational platform is essential for a practicable application of CPSs and smart factories.

FL provides privacy-by-design. It trains a machine learning model collaboratively over several distributed clients (ranging from two to millions) such as mobile phones, without sharing their raw data with any other participant. In practical scenarios, all clients do not have sufficient computing resources (e.g., Internet of Things), the machine learning model has millions of parameters, and its privacy between the server and the clients while training/testing is a prime concern (e.g., rival parties). In this regard, FL is not sufficient, so split learning (SL) is introduced. SL is reliable in these scenarios as it splits a model into multiple portions, distributes them among clients and server, and trains/tests their respective model portions to accomplish the full model training/testing. In SL, the participants do not share both data and their model portions to any other parties, and usually, a smaller network portion is assigned to the clients where data resides. Recently, a hybrid of FL and SL, called splitfed learning, is introduced to elevate the benefits of both FL (faster training/testing time) and SL (model split and training). Following the developments from FL to SL, and considering the importance of SL, this chapter is designed to provide extensive coverage in SL and its variants.

We put the emphasis on core components of IoT and blockchain, as the former lays the foundation for data collection and transmissions, while the latter paves the way for the data transparency and integrity, and more importantly, it lowers the financing cost for all participants of the supply chain.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15145-4_91-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, in OECD-Europe, transportation still represents the biggest source of carbon emissions, contributing by about 25% to the total CO 2 emissions, with cars and vans representing more than two-thirds of this share. The situation is even more alarming in non-OECD countries, where the transportation energy demand is expected to rise by 64% until 2040. The shift that we are witnessing toward the adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is going to be perhaps the most disruptive since the early days of automobiles and could revolutionize movement of people and goods. This level of connectivity and autonomy will transform transportation in several dimensions with important societal and economic impacts: improved safety, increased comfort, time saving potential, and more efficient road utilization are among the most widely discussed positive impacts of CAVs. However, the potential energy efficiency benefits of these technologies remain uncertain. From a single-vehicle efficiency perspective, research suggests that lightweight, low-speed, autonomous vehicles have the potential to achieve fuel economy an order of magnitude higher than current cars. Yet, at system-wide level, current estimates suggest that the total energy consumption impacts can range from a 90% decrease to a 200% increase in fuel consumption as compared to a projected 2050 baseline energy consumption. The paradigm that traffic congestion mitigation should reduce CO 2 emissions is yet to be proved. Therefore, interest in transportation regulation problems with explicit environmental considerations is growing. This work takes a more in-depth look at increased opportunities for energy-efficient driving with energy-oriented traffic management and CAVs deployment. In particular, the focus will be put on the road traffic control strategies in urban networks using connectivity to enable variable speed limits and traffic light adaptive control, as well as the energy-saving opportunities that arise for individual CAVs by anticipating future road geometry, traffic conditions, and interactions with neighboring vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_128-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The main goal of the event detection is to detect events (e.g., traffic, disaster) automatically from social media like Twitter. In the area of supervised event detection from Twitter, word2vec model is not yet used by the researchers as a feature extraction technique. Since word2vec introduces a new approach on feature extraction from words and documents, in this work, we propose a near real-time traffic congestion detection system from the Twitter data stream using word2vec model as our feature extraction method. The system fetches the continuous stream of tweets from Twitter, preprocess and extract features from tweets using word2vec, classifies traffic congestion related tweets and notifies the occurrence of traffic congestion in a particular region. For the classification task, we compared the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms. Our experimental results have shown that SVM outperforms the other two algorithms achieving an accuracy of 91.73%.

At the same time, they often involve surveillance of urban environments, and thus not only criminals but also large groups of people and entities unrelated to criminal phenomena can end up under close inspection. This chapter makes its contribution on two levels. For one, it offers a theoretical framework to the research and conceptualization of the role of sensing infrastructures in urban security practices. It shows how insights from Philosophy of Technology and Science and Technology Studies can produce a nuanced understanding of the role of digital technologies in security practices, beyond standard conceptualizations of technology. Moreover, the chapter proposes a geological approach to enrich our repertoire of imagining and researching smart urban ecosystems. Secondly, the chapter contributes to a higher level of transparency of these practices by presenting the results of ethnographic research performed in a set of police organizations that employ sensing infrastructures and algorithmic profiling in their practices. The chapter draws empirically on research performed in the Dutch police, both at municipal and national levels with some additional material gathered in a constabulary in England. In these organizations, resource allocation decisions are often predicated on automated number plate recognition technology that processes data from an array of smart cameras distributed in the environment.

Therefore, problem-solving will be central to their collaboration. Among notable developments in this domain is the capability for artificial agents to sample and search in a very farsighted fashion, or to be hyperopic, which is the technical term for farsighted vision, the opposite of myopia. This inverts the dominant concern of prior theory, which focuses on limited, bounded capabilities in problem-solving and decision-making. This shift poses significant opportunities and risks for augmented agents. Human processing will likely remain naturally myopic and limited, while artificial processing is increasingly hyperopic and powerful. Given these differences, digitally augmented problem-solving could be extremely divergent and dysfunctional, for example, by sampling and searching in a hyperopic fashion, while guided by persistent human myopia.

This paper proposes an autonomous driving approach based on deep learning and computer vision, by guaranteeing the basic driving functions, the communication between the vehicle and its environment, obstacles detection and traffic signs identification. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the environment perception, the lane tracking and the appropriate decisions making.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-70866-5_20,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Drowsiness and fatigue detection with cameras is still one of the major targets of DMS research and investment. In this work we present our eyelid aperture estimation method, as enabling method for estimating such physiological status, in the context of two main use cases. First, we show how the technique can be integrated into a DMS system, along with other outside-sensing components, to showcase SAE-L3 demonstrations. Second, we adopt the DMD (Driver Monitoring Dataset) open dataset project with a twofold purpose: evaluate the quality of our method compare to other state-of-the-art techniques, and to contribute to the DMD with ground truth labels about drowsiness concepts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-89170-1_9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

CPS increases the efficiency of the physical system and enhances its monitoring and control process. However, the increasing dependency of CPSs on cyber-based technologies has made them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate all threats that endanger CPSs. One of the most important issues in the deployment of CPSs is their privacy since any privacy breach can result in severe consequences. There are some techniques to preserve privacy, but most are computationally expensive or affect the system’s performance. Consequently, they are not used in practice. Nowadays, a large amount of data is being generated with the advent of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and these data are scattered across different sites and owned by different individuals.

We have become so accustomed to a smart handheld device as if it controls, manages, and records even the simplest and most straightforward task of our daily routine. The miniaturization of hardware and Internet-powered consumer appliances and services have solved diverse problems not only for an individual but also related to the community. The smart city project is effectively governing a city which was a dream a decade ago. The healthcare services, clean city drives, power and water supply departments, traffic control, surveillance, and many similar initiatives within the region of a municipal corporation have become IoT-enabled. The smart city services we enjoy may be vulnerable to attacks such as data interception over the communication channel, hacking the devices, stealing database records and consumer credentials, and financial frauds, etc. A consumer is not always aware of such attempts but can be a probable victim of such criminal activities. For a smart device manufacturer and a service provider, it is challenging to claim that their products and services are robust enough to combat all existing attacks. Since the IoT environment consists of small battery-powered devices, the security mechanisms generally employed to secure conventional devices and data within a typical Internet environment are not suitable for IoT infrastructure. Hence we have lightweight solutions to limit the security overhead of data storage and data communication between IoT nodes. The lightweight security protocols targeted towards securing IoT infrastructure are strong enough to mitigate well-known attacks while consuming less memory and resource footprint on the device. This chapter introduces the lightweight security protocols specifying their need in different smart city services. We need these protocols to perform user authentication, access control, payment mechanisms, and encrypting data during transmission, inventory management, traffic control, etc. The chapter introduces Singapore as a smart city model and aims to provide insight into existing security schemes for IoT-enabled smart city services. Lightweight cryptographic initiatives contributed significantly to assure the integrity of data in a constrained environment. We discuss lightweight primitives under block cipher, stream cipher, and hash function category. However, there are incidences where some of these schemes proved susceptible to certain cryptanalysis attempts.

According to Indian philosophy, OM is a spiritual symbol called Atman Brahman (Reality, World, Truth, God, Supreme Spirit, Cosmic Principles, and Knowledge). This research has the symbol of global OM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Gayatri Mantra recitation and Om recitation on human health. Gayatri mantra is a highly potential mantra, which is mentioned in Rig Veda. The study/Yagyopathy Experiment was performed on some patients (Male = 4) and (Females = 7) with an age range of 44–70 years. All patients were trained for reciting Gayatri mantra for 3 days. The baseline data were used. The participants participated in Gayatri mantra and Om recitation about 15 min for two consecutive days. The sequence of the session was assigned randomly to the participants. This preliminary study shows that both Gayatri mantras and sitting comfort have led to increased attention, as measured by the stroop task. However, Gayatri’s mantra effect was significantly greater than Om’s recitation. During the meeting on yagyopathy chaired by Shraddhey Dr. Sahab at Shantikunj on 23 Nov 18, Prof. Rohit Rastogi volunteered to experiment its effects on himself. I consulted Dr. Vandana Srivastava and was advised following treatment: yagyopathy twice a day, at sunrise and sunset, with havan samagri for asthma and normal samagri in 3:1 ratio, recitation of Surya Gayatri mantra 24 times and nadi-shodhan pranayama for 30 min. Kwath of mixed hawan samagri twice a day. In order to measure the efficacy of Yagyopathy, I undertook Lung Function Test (LFT) on 18 Dec 18 and started yagyopathy as above instructions (once a day) since 24 Dec 18. Following, three important parameters are measured during LFT: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC): a measure of lung capacity/volume of air can open after Deep inhalation. Forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV1): Breath measurement. FEV1/FVC: The ratio of lung size (FVC) that expires in seconds. The results obtained after undertaking yagyopathy treatment once a day for approximately 2 1/2 months indicated considerable improvement in lung function parameters.

Data in the blockchain is in the form of transactions. Blockchains are transparent, immutable and auditable distributed ledgers with peer to peer connection, cryptography and consensus algorithm. All the parties involved have the same copy of data (transparency), data cannot be modified or deleted (immutability) and a full history of transactions is available (auditable). Based on history, future transactions are validated by all the parties (consensus). Internet of Things means connecting lightweight devices to share information among themselves and to enable some functionalities based on the shared information. This exchange of information among multiple devices must be secure as it contains sensitive and safety-critical data. Because of the scale and distributed nature of IoT, security and privacy are major concerns. Traditional security solutions are not suitable for IoT devices as they have limited resources in terms of memory and processing power. Blockchain can bridge the gap. The information exchange among these devices can be stored on the blockchain to increase transparency among the devices.

The consumer IoT (cIoT) focuses on improving the quality of people’s lives while industrial IoT (iIoT) combines Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) together resulting into tremendous growth of industries driven by distinct manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and functionalities. In addition to that, the fifth generation (5G) networks accelerate iIot with a higher transmission speed, a lower latency, an increased number of connected devices, and the possibility of implementing virtual networks (network slicing). The 5G- enabled IoT (5G-IoT) will connect billions of IoT devices communicating with each other in real-time manner without human interventions which leads to the deployment of a gigantic number of devices without worrying about network traffic or network related issues. However, 5G-enabled IoT devices to suffer from privacy and security issues when used with the centralized approach which is more vulnerable to attackers. To resolve the same, Blockchain stands out as a promising technology as it offers a secure, transparent, reliable, and tempered-proof environment for 5G-enabled IoT due to its distributed and peer-to-peer network architecture. Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce the basic architecture and main features of Blockchain along with how Blockchain can be integrated with 5G-enabled IoT. Subsequently, the security requirements to manage 5G-enabled IoT devices are also illustrated.

The monitoring system must have the ability to recognize and detect the actions performed by the students. Recently many deep neural network based approaches have been proposed to automate Human Action Recognition (HAR) in different domains, but these are not explored in learning environments. HAR can be used in classrooms, laboratories, and libraries to make the teaching-learning process more effective. To make the learning process more effective in computer laboratories, in this study, we proposed a system for recognition and localization of student actions from still images extracted from (Closed Circuit Television) CCTV videos. The proposed method uses (You Only Look Once) YOLOv3, state-of-the-art real-time object detection technology, for localization, recognition of students’ actions. Further, the image template matching method is used to decrease the number of image frames and thus processing the video quickly. As actions performed by the humans are domain specific and since no standard dataset is available for students’ action recognition in smart computer laboratories, thus we created the STUDENT ACTION dataset using the image frames obtained from the CCTV cameras placed in the computer laboratory of a university campus. The proposed method recognizes various actions performed by students in different locations within an image frame.

This is due to the electrification of the global energy system and a shift towards distributed power production from sustainable sources. Energy management solutions have been proposed that help mitigate high costs of physical grid extension by utilizing existent grid capacities more efficiently. Yet, these solutions often interfere with customer processes and/or restrict free access to the energy market. The RLS “regional load shaping” approach proposes a market-based solution that resolves this dilemma for the mid voltage grid: the RLS business model gives incentives to all stakeholders to allocate so-called “conditional loads”, which are flexible loads that are not subjected to (n – 1) security of supply; the RLS load management solution then assigns these loads to cost-optimized time slots in the traditionally unused N – 1 capacity band. The paper provides a validation of the technical aspects of the RLS approach: an evaluation of the day-ahead load forecasting method for industry customers is given, as well as a validation of the load optimization heuristics based on simulated capacity bottlenecks. It is shown that the prediction model provides competitive results in terms of accuracy, and that RLS method handles all provoked critical network capacity situations as expected.

A number of time-series forecasting models have been developed to predict air-pollution. However, an evaluation of individual and ensemble models for real-time air pollution forecasting lacks in the literature. The primary objective of this research is to develop and test individual and ensemble time-series forecasting models for real-time forecasting of air pollution ahead in time. Air pollution data of suspended particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) over 5-years from Beijing, China was used for model comparisons. The PM 2.5 -time-series was split as the first 80% for training and the latter 20% for testing time-series forecasting models. Five individual time-series forecasting models, namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) were developed. Also, a new weighted ensemble model of these individual models was developed. Among the individual models, results revealed that both during training and test, the CNN performed the best, and this model was followed by the LSTM, MLP, and SARIMA models.

Against this backdrop, federated machine learning, a technique to collaboratively train models without transferring data to a centralized location, has been recently proposed. With each government entity keeping their data private, new applications that previously were impossible now can be a reality. In this paper, we demonstrate that accountability for the federated machine learning process becomes paramount to fully overcoming legislative and jurisdictional constraints.

Our approach considers temporal and spatial aspects of collected data to avoid correlation between the training set and the validation set. Connected vehicles broadcast messages containing safety-critical information at high frequency. Thus, detecting faulty messages induced by attacks is crucial for road-users safety. High frequency broadcast makes the temporal aspect decisive in building the cross-validation sets at the data preparation level of the data mining cycle. Therefore, we conduct a statistical study considering various fake position attacks. We statistically examine the difficulty of detecting the faulty messages, and generate useful features of the raw data. Then, we apply machine learning methods for misbehavior detection, and discuss the obtained results. We apply our data splitting approach to message-based and communication-based data modeling and compare our approach to traditional splitting approaches. Our study shows that traditional splitting approaches performance is biased as it causes data leakage, and we observe a 10% drop in performance in the testing phase compared to our approach.

In this context, this work aims to conduct a comprehensive study on memes classification, generally on the VL multimodal problems and cutting edge solutions. We propose a generalized framework for VL problems. We cover the early and next-generation works on VL problems. Finally, we identify and articulate several open research issues and challenges. This is the first study that presents the generalized view of the advanced classification techniques concerning memes classification to the best of our knowledge. We believe this study presents a clear road-map for the Machine Learning (ML) research community to implement and enhance memes classification techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66840-2_109,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Altogether, Bitcoin is a network in which every computing node is responsible to service the others and allows shared access to the data, known peer to peer (P2P) network, and provides an adaption of electronic-cash that supports e-payments. Such payments are transferred directly from transacting parties to the receiver without the requirement of any intermediary monetary body. Satoshi Nakamoto introduced bitcoin in 2009 and since then it has emerged as the most thriving cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a globally accepted and immutable e-payment system of digital currency. All the electronic transactions performed using bitcoin are verified by the intermediate nodes called miners and then added as a block in the distributed ledger. Bitcoin blockchains are maintained by the miners running Bitcoin software. Bitcoin depends on Proof-of-Work (PoW) to confront double-spending by a distributed timestamping service. To ensure the operations and security of Bitcoin, all the transactions and their execution order must be available to all Bitcoin users. In addition to its security robustness, anonymity is the key attribute for its success. There are several factors like market-cap, the marketplace, miners-revenue, etc. which causes the rise and fall of the price of Bitcoin. This chapter focus on the factors that are responsible for the rise and fall of Bitcoin Price with a comparison with other Cryptocurrencies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-69395-4_2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, there is no single website or a search engine that provides information on vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, controls, etc. Ambiguity, bias and lack of credibility are some of the alarming issues while dealing with generic search engines on sensitive topics such as ‘Health’ and ‘Information Security’. A dedicated information security specific search engine benefits various stakeholders including security professionals, researchers, government, regulators and others. We implemented a fine grained approach that identifies sub-domains of information security, extracts related URLs and content and assesses search results credibility to enhance adoption of information security specific search engine. To identify sub-domains and extract seed and child URLs, a fine grained approach that extends an efficient Artificial Bee Colony algorithm was implemented. About 34,007 seed URLs and 400,726 child URLs of various sub-domains of the information security were extracted. The results of the proposed approach identified more URLs (seed and child) of sub-domains as compared to existing approaches while consuming less computing resources. The research literature on web page ranking and credibility identified a need for fine grained assessment of search results based on surface, content and off-page features. Furthermore, the fine grained web page features were classified into genres using a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree algorithm with an accuracy of 88.75%. Based on features and genres, a FACT score was formulated to rank the web pages based on credibility. An open-source WEBCred framework was developed to calculate the FACT score of 10,429 URLs in information security domain. The results compared against Web of Trust score and Alexa ranking are promising. A S ecurity I nformation and E xtraction e N gine (SIREN) was developed and hosted to demonstrate the proposed approaches. The SIREN is expected to be integrated into Indian Banks’ Centre for Analysis of Risks and Threats platform so that banks can use it for threat intelligence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-71381-2_16,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional lane-direction configuration solutions assume pre-known traffic patterns, hence are not suitable for real-world applications as they are not able to adapt to changing traffic conditions. We propose a dynamic lane configuration solution for improving traffic flow using a two-layer, multi-agent architecture, named Coordinated Learning-based Lane Allocation (CLLA). At the bottom-layer, a set of reinforcement learning agents find a suitable configuration of lane-directions around individual road intersections. The lane-direction changes proposed by the reinforcement learning agents are then coordinated by the upper level agents to reduce the negative impact of the changes on other parts of the road network. CLLA is the first work that allows city-wide lane configuration while adapting to changing traffic conditions. Our experimental results show that CLLA can reduce the average travel time in congested road networks by 20% compared to an uncoordinated reinforcement learning approach.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-67667-4_18,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This will ensure that intermittent nature of these renewable sources and significant variations in demand and supply can be taken care. The novel technologies with innovative solutions need to be incorporated to transform the electrical networks into smarter grids. The role of information and communication technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), energy storage, intelligent control systems, and smart energy meters will be crucial in the development of smart energy systems. These smart energy systems will play vital role in improving renewables’ performance and exploitation with real-time balancing between supply, demand, and storage. Besides, it will also help in energy efficiency, reducing energy waste, peak curtailment using demand-response management, reduction in system’s overall cost, better network control, enhanced performance and reliability of power system with optimal planning of the transmission and distribution systems, and implementation of microgrids with additional distributed generation (DG), etc. In real world, different energy sources and technologies exist, and together fulfills the global energy demand. A smart energy system, therefore, should consider the integration of different energy infrastructure, which may include the production, conversion, storage, and consumption of different energy sources in an intelligent manner. Transportation and storage are going through a revolutionary transformation phase, where a lot of research has been devoted on different aspects to make them an affordable reality. All these lead to new challenges and opportunities, such as charging infrastructure, power quality, frequency response with reducing system inertia, etc. Our current energy system simply cannot map the demands from homes and businesses accurately, and a data-driven approach with smart energy meters may resolve the problem with the use of digital technology to actively monitor the generation and consumptions patterns at root levels. This chapter aims to introduce the concept of smart energy systems (SES).

For multidisciplinary universities, this type of model can produce poor performance. In this study, we propose to consider 4-grade levels of degree classification in Vietnam, and the prediction is based on the average performance in previous semesters to perform the prediction tasks. Four student groups are trained separately with their mark records—the used model depends on students’ average marks in previous semesters. The proposed method is validated on more than 4.5 million mark records of nearly 100,000 students at a multidisciplinary university in Vietnam.

Adopted techniques include approaches based on statistics generated by equipment manufacturers, human knowledge, and intuition based on experience among others. However, techniques like those mentioned above often address only a limited set of the potential root causes, leading to unexpected breakdown or failure. As a consequence, maintenance costs were considered a financial burden that each company had to sustain. Nevertheless, as technology advances, user experience and intuition are enhanced by artificial intelligence approaches, transforming maintenance costs into a company’s strategic asset. In particular, for manufacturing industries, a large volume of data is generated on a shop floor as digitisation advances. Combining information and communication technologies Information and communication technologies  (ICT) with artificial intelligence techniques may create insight over production processes, complement or support human knowledge, revealing undetected anomalies and patterns that can help predict maintenance actions. Consequently, the company yields a reduction of unexpected breakdowns, production stoppages, and production costs. The outcomes are significant but selecting an appropriate data-driven method that can generate helpful and trustworthy results is challenging. It is mainly affected by the quality of the available data and the capability to understand the process under analysis correctly.

Deploying this concept in the transportation domain evolved into the concept of Vehicular Ad-hoc Sensor Networks (VASNETs) or Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). VANETs turned out to act as a boon to enhance the safety and non-safety aspects of the transportation domain, giving way to the future of Intelligent Transport Systems. To generate cooperative awareness in the network, VANETs use beacons, which are small packets of information transmitted as BSMs (Basic Safety Messages). Beaconing was developed in the initial phases of development of VANETs and mainly suffers a trade-off between channel congestion and the level of accuracy of exchanged information. In this work, an adaptive speed based beaconing approach is proposed, the approach uses probability as a means to answer two key questions. First is whether to beacon or not and second is at what rate beaconing should be done to reduce channel congestion and increase the accuracy of information. The results are compared with an adaptive density-based approach and with normal static beaconing cases. Performance evaluation on Veins framework demonstrates that it gives better results as compared to both the other approaches. Further, the results concerning generated BSMs, received BSMs and total packet loss are compared. The simulation is modeled to make it as realistic as possible by introducing a vast heterogeneous network with random vehicle mobility trips.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76063-2_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With most energy created by burning fossil fuels, a highly inefficient method of energy creation, global greenhouse gas levels are rising, raising the temperature of the earth, causing natural processes to become unbalanced. The health of the earth is declining. The rise of technology and persisting growth of computing devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT) and increasing automation of systems through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is a factor of energy expenditure as more humans desire devices and more systems are built. The ethical implications of utilizing new technology should be evaluated before creating more. This paper explores modern computing systems in the sectors that draw the most energy, and, more specifically, the role AI and IoT play in them. Each sector may become more energy efficient, productive, and safer by introducing edge computing through IoT devices and coupling it with AI computing abilities that already automate most processes. Multiple studies show energy consumption and costs are lowered when edge computing is paired with the IoT and AI. There is less human involvement, more regularity in execution and performance, and more widespread use because of the accessibility. This creates safer, cheaper, energy-efficient systems that utilize existing technology. The ethical implications of these systems are much more positive than what already exists.

However, pure Ad Hoc networking without a logical centric node can barely provide consistent collaboration between mobile nodes during monitoring.

Although, there is a plethora of studies in the literature evaluating various technologies, most of the models of technology acceptance and theories selected are applied on barriers of successful IT implementation in organisations or generally on technologies that have long been deployed. There are very few studies conducted on disruptive technologies such as AV. In this paper, this issue has been addressed with the identification of context-related constructs partly retrieved from existing literature, that describe a modelling process for a technology acceptance attempting to explain the main factors influencing people behavioural intention to adopt autonomous vehicle technology. Constructs such as trust, self-efficacy, anxiety, perceived safety and legal regulation have been considered. The main contribution of the study is the detailed exploration on the users’ acceptance of AV. We propose a theoretical model called Autonomous Vehicle Technology Acceptance Model (AVTAM) that gives us a better understanding of what will eventually influence future AV customers.

However, previous studies have paid relatively less attention to the trip purpose imputation at an individual level and required no real-time response. To narrow the gaps, a two-phase probabilistic framework TripImputor is proposed in this chapter, to perform real-time taxi trip purpose imputation and personalized recommendation service when passengers get off the taxi. To be more specific, a two-stage clustering algorithm is proposed in the first phase to obtain candidate activity areas (CAAs) in the urban space. Based on that, we extract fine-grained spatiotemporal regularity of human behaviors within each CAA with the Foursquare check-in data. Such process can gain on the priori probability for each kind of human activity and obtain the posterior probabilities of taxi trip purposes by employing Bayes’ theory. In the second phase, historical drop-off locations would be clustered then matched with CAAs for the real-time response. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and response of our proposed methods.

The researchers need to refine new methods for identifying compromised loT machines to prevent such cyberattacks. In the smart networks, traditional protection strategies are cumbersome to implement because of complexity in communication systems, vendor regulations, requirements, technology and location-specific resources.

Such high range of communication expressed by the smart vehicles makes many existing tasks easier to the vehicle owners and also introduces new features to increase the ease of the vehicle usage for the owners. Further, this high degree of communications also paves road for security threats which makes the smart vehicles highly vulnerable to privacy attacks like location tracking, remote hijacking of the vehicle. Such security attacks on smart vehicles not only questions the security of the vehicle, it also has greater effects in the safety of the passengers. Also, it is obvious that smart vehicles do have lot of sensors, cameras, devices like GPS and others which produce huge volume of data to be sent to the drivers or to the other sensor or devices connected to it. Such data carries sensitive information that needs to be protected to avoid privacy breach. So security is very important in dealing with smart vehicles. Traditional security and privacy strategies used in smart vehicles are not efficient to meet the threats that the vehicles are fronting mainly because they follow centralized mechanism to extend the security. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that maintains a chain of blocks to provide security and privacy. Blockchain provides security from all dimensions, and hence, it is popular in crypto-currencies, smart contracts. Each communication is referred as transaction in blockchain technologies and the transaction will be broadcasted to all participating nodes of the transaction for the verification and once verified the transaction will be added as new block to already existing blocks. To overcome the drawbacks in the traditional automotive security, blockchain technologies can be implemented to meet the requirement for the automotive security and privacy. The blockchain is formed by chaining the time-stamped blocks one after the other and a block includes the hash of the previous block in the blockchain. Hence, any changes made in a block will be notified easily by propagating changes in the hash of the following blocks. This feature makes the blockchain a better technology for automotive security. Additionally, blockchain enables the user to have flexible public key system, which makes the tracking ability of the user a tough task and hence protects the privacy of the user. Moreover, blockchain has its own reasons, why it cannot be implemented readily in automotive industry. The reasons be like, delay in getting verifications from participating nodes, where vehicles cannot wait so long to make decisions if there is delay. Other reasons may include scalability issues when there are more nodes involved in a transaction and what if there is increase in the number of nodes.

For example, in the edge computing scenario of telecom operators, curious users of edge nodes can easily collect and pry into other users’ location information, service content, and usage frequency.

The project addresses these problems of demand for well equipped and maintained homes by proposing a cost-effective solution to detect leakages and manage pressure, which in turn leads to significant water savings and reduced pipe breakage frequencies, especially in older infrastructure systems. A water distribution system is modeled and simulated using EPANET software. A classification model is developed which is based on Supervised Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) using SuSi framework. This model can perform unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised classification and regression tasks on high-dimensional data. Another regression model is developed which is based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm, a class of feedforward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The performance of both the proposed models is compared based on the accuracy to detect the leakage based on the leak and pressure values simulated using the EPANET software.

It is the junction that integrates salient computing domains and subdomains to create a self-driven, self-healing, and self-manageable computing environment. The possible integration, exploration, and hybridization toward the development of the new models and applications are new knowledge contributions. Modeling is a conceptualization of autonomic computing in general and contextualization in specific applications. In the context of cloud-based autonomic computing, a model presents the fact that the operations of the autonomic computing systems are goal-oriented and driven by certain activities and follow certain policies and behavioral aspects, with the existing features. Currently, client organizations or individual clients prefer to use packaged computing products and services over the cloud or distributed systems. This chapter covers how autonomic computing models hold the promising features for s implification, and the ease of computing system management over clouds such as process management, autonomic client migration for load balancing, monitoring, energy efficiency(green), automatic updating of software tools/drivers, predictive warning before failure, error detection and correction, backups, and recovery from sudden disasters. This chapter also covers the possible applications and related issues encountered during adaption and adoption at salient scales and types of organizations. The summarized feature-based comparative analysis of the existing computing and emerging autonomic models are also incorporated.

However, it is challenging to enable edge-based model training while still satisfying the requirement of user privacy. A faster model training process is commonly at the cost of more disclosure of user privacy. We propose a federated learning driven privacy-preserving model training framework called FedEVA for edge video analytics, which can protect user privacy and ensure a fast convergence rate. Instead of directly sending gradients to the parameter server, users conduct a local perturbation operation on users’ update information, and then send the perturbed gradients to the parameter server. The parameter server at the edge can update the neural network model directly over the perturbed gradients. We carefully design the perturbation function to conceal partial information about data while efficiently performing computation over the gradients from multiple users. Different from crypto-based methods, our perturbation process is a light-weight operation. We conduct extensive evaluations using large-scale real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our FedEVA framework and compare with other baseline algorithms. The results show that our FedEVA framework can improve the degree of privacy preservation, and still maintain the same level of convergence rate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57328-7_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

GPS errors in different road segments can be further predicted by estimating the negative impact of the urban environment on GPS accuracy, and we refer to this impact as GPS environmental friendliness (GEF). In this chapter, we propose a method for processing and analysing a large amount of historical bus GPS trajectory data, combined with road context information, to estimate the GEF of urban roads. We take full advantage of the fixed characteristic of bus routes to improve the performance of map matching. The method estimates the GPS positioning error of each bus on the roads that are not covered by its route, by considering POI information, tag information of roads, and building layout information. Finally, we utilize a weighted estimation strategy to calculate the GEF of each road based on the GPS positioning performance of all buses.

This trend is called the “Internet of Things” (IoT). IoT is a superset of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, encompassing the interconnection of intelligent devices and management platforms through advanced communication technologies developed for the Internet. IoTs connect to the Internet, often through some intermediate network for access control, to transmit data about their state or the state of the environment in which they are embedded and to receive data controlling the device’s state. IoT brings the Internet, data collection, processing, and analytics to the real world of physical objects.

To meet the great demand for stream processing, many stream data storage systems have been implemented and widely deployed, such as Kafka, Pulsar and DistributedLog. These systems differ in many aspects including design objectives, target application scenarios, access semantics, user API, and implementation technologies. Each system use a dedicated tool to evaluate its performance. And different systems measure different performance metrics using different loads. For infrastructure architects, it is important to compare the performances of different systems under diverse loads using the same benchmark. Moreover, for system designers and developers, it is critical to study how different implementation technologies affect their performance. However, there is no such a benchmark tool yet which can evaluate the performances of different systems. Due to the wide diversities of different systems, it is challenging to design such a benchmark tool. In this paper, we present SSBench, a benchmark tool designed for stream data storage systems. SSBench abstracts the data and operations in different systems as “data streams” and “reads/writes” to data streams. By translating stream read/write operations into the specific operations of each system using its own APIs, SSBench can evaluate different systems using the same loads. In addition to measure simple read/write performance, SSBench also provides several specific performance measurements for stream data, including end-to-end read latency, performance under imbalanced loads and performance of transactional loads. This paper also presents the performance evaluation of four typical systems, Kafka, Pulsar, DistributedLog and ZStream, using SSBench, and discussion of the causes for their performance differences from the perspective of their implementation techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-1160-5_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With the development and increasing number of AVs and CAVs in mixed traffic flow, it is necessary to analyze their impact on traffic safety, flow, speed, fuel consumption, and emissions. Also, appropriate traffic control algorithms need to be developed before they can be fully implemented and integrated into the traffic environment. To do so, such mixed traffic flows must be simulated in various traffic scenarios. Traffic flow simulators paired with communication network simulators are commonly used to perform multiple simulations of such traffic flows. In this paper, three often used traffic simulators VISSIM, AIMSUN, and SUMO paired with network simulators NS-3 and OMNET++ with their features to model AVs and CAVs in a simulation environment are analyzed. According to currently available and tested simulators in the research community, the most used ones were compared.

Previous device identification methods perform poorly in real-world networks where much unknown traffic exists, since they only focus on improving performance on closed datasets and rely on manual features that are difficult to generalize. To achieve robust IoT device identification, we propose a new approach with unknown traffic detection, which consists of general training and novel inference stage. In the first stage, a simple neural network is trained to extract spatial-temporal features automatically and explicitly form tight clusters of known devices through multi-task learning. Furthermore, we use extreme value theory (EVT) to model the boundary of each cluster in the feature space. Then the probability of unknown traffic is recalibrated in the inference stage.

Violence emancipates from strong protests to extreme disturbing activities by the mob. Violence unfolds itself from low level violence to extreme violence. This journey has two major steps. Stone Pelting and Arson activities are the two most ferocious activities by mobs from which classify the violence as building from low level violence to extreme violence. Arson is a spontaneous activity which is executed by protestors for showing extreme emotional dissent to the governing authorities. Lead by mob, arson is a dangerous activity and constitute most ferocious form of violence. Stone pelting is again an extreme case of mob fury against governing authorities. Pelting refers to throwing number of things at someone or something very quickly. Stone pelting is thus the most feared form of crowd violence that needs to be tackled on priority. Arson and stone pelting activities generate a fear in crowd and endangers life of humans and public and private property.

Such technologies make it possible for grid administrators to make informed decisions in reacting to anomalies such as panel damage, electrical errors, monitoring hardware decay, or malicious data injection attacks. Smart edge devices offer an opportunity to reduce the cost of continuously sending data for anomaly detection by performing analytics on local edge device within a given farm and sending only the result of the analysis back to datacenters.

Attention taxing, infotainment systems could dramatically reduce the driver’s ability to respond effectively in an imminent collision situation . Current attempts to reduce this negative impact on driver’s performance had limited success. To improve the driver’s ability to perform a successful collision avoidance braking or manoeuvring, this paper presents the design considerations of a prototype system that employs Augmented Reality (AR) to overlay guidance information in the real-life environment. The proposed system will be further supported by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that will act as a co-driver, offering in real-time alternative options to the driver. Prior work for the development of a similar system for Emergency Services’ (ES) vehicles sparked the idea to transfer and investigate the acceptance of this technology on a civilian vehicle domain. In conclusion, the paper presents the preliminary design for the development of the civilian version of the AR/AI system based on the feedback and suggestions of 20 drivers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73100-7_32,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Location estimation is one of the major requirements that lead to the emergence of various localization techniques. In addition to the position estimation, security is also one of the prime concerns in the localization process as we the presence of attackers in the network cannot be eliminated. There are various security requirements that need to be fulfilled by the algorithms if we need to make them secure. The previous research lacks the requirements for the design of algorithms that lead to the need of distributed range-free approach as compared to range-based algorithms on account of the use of GPS makes the system more massive and expensive irrespective of accuracy. So, it makes a challenge for researchers to design some range-free approaches. But integrating security aspects in those algorithms is also very challenging and important task. Moreover, the security of multimedia applications is also very important pertaining to the localization. This chapter presents the overview of the localization process in detail along with the issues pertaining to the localization process.

It is evident that in the terahertz imaging system, a terahertz source plays a significant role, and for the pulsed terahertz spectroscopy, the use of photoconductive terahertz antenna is generally required. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the developments occurred so far in the field of terahertz antennas related to terahertz sensing and imaging applications. An optimum design of terahertz array antenna helps to enhance the imaging capabilities to address the considerations such as limited depth-of-field (DoF) that is the distance over which an object is considered in focus and size-weight-and-power (SWaP) of terahertz source for imaging applications. These are the important considerations for applications such as stand-off imaging and surveillance of moving targets where the high angular resolution as well as extended depth-of-field is the key for successful detection of hidden explosives and illicit drugs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68960-5_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Likewise, the pace of global development, increased population size, nuanced encounters, and lack of medical security in developing countries all contribute to the complexities of COVID-19 prevention and regulation. The COVID-19 seems to have a greater impact on the global economy when compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurs in 2013. The bone of contention is how to fight the spread of these infectious diseases and how to contains it spread from human-to-human. Most countries depended on the observation of classic steps to monitor diseases and public health to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to those used with SARS in 2003. Data in the healthcare sector are usually huge and not easy to handle, this results from the enormous way by which data grows in the healthcare sector, the rate at which data are been produced, and the variety of various data in the healthcare system contributed to this growth. Also, the rate at which these data are been captured, stored, analyzed, and retrieved in healthcare has swiftly from the aged paper-based storage technique to the use of digital techniques and methods. Hence, the application of advanced technologies which includes virtualization and cloud computing allows for huge and effective data processing in the healthcare system. Thereby rapidly turning the healthcare system into a big data industry. Nevertheless, in these modern days, the improvement in the information and communication technologies (ICT) brings the advancement of varied data from new sources in the healthcare system. Therefore, this chapter discusses the possible application of big data and analytics to improve conventional public health approaches to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic to control, manage, identify and avoid COVID-19 and reduce the effect on health implicitly associated with COVID-19.

Its importance has been increasing in recent years as there has been a marked intensity in public or academic writings in this field. In recent years, the GCC GCC states have allocated significant financial resources for their health sectors as part of their strategic visions. The momentum in the health sector is reflected in the different GCC visions such as UAE vision vision 2021, Qatar Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia Vision 2030, Kuwait Vision 2035, and Bahrain Vision 2030. Health diplomacy diplomacy plays a critical role in this policy direction with the need for know-how and the interdependence of our world. In parallel, many of these states have also heavily invested—or are planning to invest—in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology technology and applications, including in their health sectors. This chapter looks into AI as a central piece of the healthcare sector in the post hydrocarbon future of the GCC. It provides a unique evaluation of AI in the context of its impact on the healthcare system and health diplomacy diplomacy .

The human qualities of creativity, the ability to improvise and cooperate, and resourcefulness open up new possibilities to engage and participate in value creation processes. Not only could new technologies create the need for different goods and services; they could also take over repetitive, physically demanding, and dangerous work. This would allow people to dedicate their time to other endeavors, such as pursuing their interests and doing things that are meaningful to them. Leadership principles will be much affected by the development of future HMI. Technological development can lead to significant increases in productivity, but it will depend on how these gains are distributed between economic and social groups. Even in the year 2030, people will still be superior to machines and use them as tools, not the other way around. Therefore, the tools will develop depending on the goals of the people.

Even if organizations have not been able to make the move to cloud so far, it is part of the near-term business goals for many. In the social context, the cloud has a significant effect on human interactions; we are also saving more and more of our personal (and confidential) data on the cloud. During the first global lockdown in March 2020, the uptake in social media increased dramatically. It is predicted that the ‘new normal’ will involve a continued use of social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram as well as conferencing tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. In fact, the cloud is seen to be more crucial to everyday life now more than ever before. While good from a revenue-generating perspective for cloud operators and service providers, this is a challenging situation to manage. The post-COVID-19 cloud represents a nexus of critical drivers including cyber-security, reliability, efficiency and cost that could transform the way the cloud and its associated technologies operate. In this chapter, we therefore examine the inter-relationships between these qualities, giving specific attention to the achievement of privacy and security. A proposal is made to extend the original CIA triad, which defines the priorities that should be given when integrating security into an organization, with a focus on the achievement of confidentiality, integrity and availability; with the achievement of these, we argue that there is an overall focus on reliability. The proposed extension, which forms eCIA, advocates that network reliability be achieved in parallel with efficiency. When considered together, in a planned approach that is not applied as a bolt-on reaction to a breach, there is a careful balance to reach in the parallel achievement of all objectives. In this chapter, we consider potential ways in which the competing goals may be facilitated simultaneously.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-71381-2_18,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The system can autonomously satisfy goals related to anomaly detection and respond to user Q&A in real time. The system learns directly from experience with no initial training required (one-shot).

However, the cost of treating some diseases is high, and for many families with limited financial resources, it is difficult to spend so much money on treatment in a short period of time. As a result, more and more people are launching fundraising projects through third-party platforms such as Water Drops and Easy Fundraising, using the money raised to treat diseases. However, these third-party platforms have many problems, such as easy to disclose the private information of people who seeking help, the fundraising process is complex and slow, the use of project funds is difficult to timely monitor, the release of false fundraising projects for fundraising fraud, and so on. For these reasons, fewer members of the public will believe the authenticity of fundraising projects, so that it is not easy to donate to fundraising projects, which also makes it difficult for people who really need to raise funds to treat diseases. In view of this situation, this paper puts forward a blockchain and smart contract-based fundraising system for critical diseases, which can solve the problems existing in third-party platforms, and can help helpers quickly raise funds to cure diseases, it also can avoid the abuse of fundraising funds, false fundraising and other acts.

To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce an ML behavior-based approach to prevent malicious control of SHS devices by misbehaved SmartApps. To do so, control commands issued by the SmartApps during regular operation are captured to build a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) model as a baseline for each installed SmartApp. Then, anomalous commands (i.e., outlier data points) should be detected and rejected, while normal commands (i.e., inlier data points) are allowed to be executed.

Finally, we report the research methods and findings from a study aiming at exploring the use of IoT in interdisciplinary teaching and learning of topics of physics, chemistry, natural sciences, geography, and mathematics with Portuguese students of the 7th grade. In this study, a greenhouse equipped with sensors is used, in articulation with external open data feeds, to support interdisciplinary learning activities in a nonformal context. The chapter includes findings from inquiring the students about their perceptions of the learning experience. The scalability of the learning setup to a network of multiple devices and schools is also included in this chapter as a main current research challenge. The results show that in general, students prefer to analyze and learn through data provided by IoT technologies than the normal classes with schoolbooks and prefer local devices than use open data feeds. They were also motivated and willing to use these resources in classroom environments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85720-2_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Among the several managerial practices put in place by companies to undertake this transition, the adoption of digital technologies is assuming a pivotal role. Nevertheless, the role digital technologies play, both in terms of functionalities and circular value targets that can be reached because of their adoption, is still largely unexplored.

We examine this approach in the synchronous and the asynchronous mode over random graphs with a varied graph order and connectivity by applying two metrics. Our goal is to identify in which mode the algorithm performs better in terms of the number of the clock ticks and the number of the sent messages as well as how the network size and connectivity can affect the performance of this algorithm.

Cyber-attacks that compromise data integrity in SCADA systems such as an unauthorised manipulation of sensor or control signals could have a severe impact on the operation of the critical national infrastructure as it misleads system operators into making wrong decisions. This work investigates the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack that aims explicitly at compromising data integrity of SCADA systems. The IEC 60870-5-104 tele-control communication protocol is used as the subject focus because it is a commonly used communication protocol in electrical power SCADA systems for tele-control and monitoring. We conducted several MITM attacks: covering the capturing, modification and injection of control commands, on IEC 60870-5-104 in our power grid SCADA system testbed. We described and performed the attacks in detail, together with several use cases. Based on the Proof-of-Concept (POC) conducted and data that we gathered, it shows that IEC 60870-5-104 is vulnerable against MITM attacks and it can be an entry point of cyberattacks, be it sophisticated or otherwise.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6835-4_40,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Different approaches have been proposed to classify Internet traffic to manage both security and Quality of Service (QoS). However, traditional classification approaches consisting of modifying the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) scheme have not been adopted due to their complex management. In addition, port-based methods and deep packet inspection have limitations in dealing with new traffic characteristics (e.g., dynamic port allocation, tunneling, encryption). Conversely, machine learning (ML) solutions effectively classify traffic down to the device type and specific user action. Another research direction aims to anonymize Internet traffic and thwart classification to maintain user privacy. Existing traffic surveys focus on classification and do not consider anonymization. Here, we review the Internet traffic classification and obfuscation techniques, largely considering the ML-based solutions.

Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories.

This all is merely possible with the sensor-enabled technologies, e.g., wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in various landscapes, where security provisioning is one of the significant challenges for miniaturized power hungry networks. Due to the increasing demand for the commercial Internet of things (IoT) devices, smart devices are also extensively adopted in industrial applications. If these devices are compromising the date/information, then there will be a considerable loss and critical issues, unlike information compromising level by the commercial IoT devices. So emerging industrial processes and smart IoT based methods in medical industries with state-of-the-art blockchain security techniques have motivated the role of secure industrial IoT. Also, frequent changes in android technology have increased the security of the blockchain-based IIoT system management. It is very vital to develop a novel blockchain-enabled cyber-security framework and algorithm for industrial IoT by adopting random initial and master key generation mechanisms over long-range low-power wireless networks for fast encrypted data processing and transmission. So, this paper has three remarkable contributions. First, a blockchain-driven secure, efficient, reliable, and sustainable algorithm is proposed. It can be said that the proposed solution manages keys randomly by introducing the chain of blocks with less power drain, a small number of cores, will slightly more communication and computation bits. Second, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based intelligent decision-making approach for the secure, concurrent, interoperable, sustainable, and reliable blockchain-driven IIoT system. AHP based solution helps the industry experts to select the more relevant and critical parameters such as (reliability in-line with a packet loss ratio), (convergence in mapping with delay), and (interoperability in association with throughput) for improving the yield of the product in the industry. Third, sustainable technology-oriented services are supporting to propose the novel cloud-enabled framework for the IIoT platform for regular monitoring of the products in the industry.

This paper presents a fall detection method that detects and notifies fall activity in real-time using fog computing. Support Vector Machine based one class classification is used here to build fall detection model. Five features have been calculated from Smartphone accelerometer data to build fall detection model.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies and their relations. While the design and deployment of systems that continually adapt holds the promise of far-reaching positive change, they simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us, ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13347-020-00405-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This research aims to pragmatically optimize Wireless Sensor Network Localization and Network Coverage issues using nature-inspired algorithms. The specific objective is to establish an optimal nature-inspired algorithm and comparing it with other algorithms regarding the capacity to achieve manufacturing optimization in large WSNs, especially in relation to the parameters of high scalability, data delivery rate, and low-energy consumption. Also, the study seeks to determine the extent to which swarm intelligence (SI)-based centralized clustering solutions (optimal nature-inspired algorithms), compared to other approaches, might optimize the WSN features of localization and network coverage. To determine the solutions’ performance, the study involved three scenarios. In scenario 1, the network operational time and the stability of SI-based algorithms were investigated for large WSNs that had the minimum heterogeneity. Imperative to note is that the WSNs on focus had different numbers of nodes, which included 500, 300, and 100. In scenario 2, the motivation was to investigate the SI-based WSN protocols in relation to the parameters of packet delivery, energy conception, and network lifetime for large WSNs. In scenario 3, the performance of SI-based solutions over large WSNs was compared to that which had been reported previously for other algorithms; with the target parameters of comparison being attributes such as packet delivery, energy conception, and network lifetime. From the findings, this study established that SI-based centralized clustering solutions are not only more recent but also exhibit superior performance compared to other algorithms; with the parameters of the amount of data delivered to the BS, energy consumption and scalability on the focus.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-020-01542-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Often, the extensive fragmentation, traditional procurement structures, destructive competition, lack of collaboration and transparency, low-profit margins, and human resources are shown as the main culprits for this. As blockchain technology makes its presence felt strongly in many other industries like finance and banking, this study investigates the preparation of construction supply chains for blockchain technology through an explorative analysis. Empirical data for the study were collected through semi-structured interviews with 17 subject experts. Alongside presenting a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis (SWOT), the study exhibits the requirements for and steps toward a construction supply structure facilitated by blockchain technology.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42524-020-0110-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Their potential failures can cause serious problems not only to the population and economy but also to national security as well. The importance of these infrastructures calls for measures toward their security and protection. The aim was the reduction of risk related to natural disasters, terrorist acts, and cyberthreats. Traditional security systems, even those that employ intelligent algorithms, fail to prevent advanced zero-day attacks as they require constant training. This research proposes a novel meta-learning architecture that considers the neural turing machines as the approach upon which the model is founded. The introduced model allows for the memorization of useful data from past processes, by integrating external storage memory. Moreover, it facilitates the rapid integration of new information without the need for retraining. In particular, the proposed novel architecture is called memory-augmented neural network (M-ANN) whose core is a sophisticated, very fast, and highly efficient extreme learning machine. The M-ANN is assisted by a series of original modifications, related to fine-tuning of training, to memory retrieval mechanisms, to addressing techniques, and to ways of attention-weight allocation to memory vectors. The efficiency of the proposed system has been successfully tested using an extremely complex scenario for the protection of critical infrastructures. According to the testing scenario, memory could quickly encode and record information about new types of attacks, while any stored representation from previous experience was easily and consistently accessible, to maximize the detection efficiency.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-04760-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The goal is to address the problem of companies that manage a private infrastructure of machines, i.e., a cloud platform and would like to optimize the scheduling of several requests submitted online by users. For the sake of simplicity of the presentation, the proposed economic model has two SLAs classes (qualitative and quantitative) with three Quality of Service for each SLA class (Premium, Advanced and Best effort). The consequence of this choice as well as the need to serve requests as they come have an impact on the algorithmic ways to consolidate an infrastructure. Indeed, our system proposes a new allocation heuristic that adapts the number of active machines in the cloud according to the global resources usage of all machines inside the infrastructure. This heuristic can be examined as a consolidation heuristic, based on the idea that the system can make reasonable choices, based on the SLAs, for the placement and the allocation of resources for each request. Experimentation with our system is conducted on Prezi (Web workload) and Google Cloud Data (HPC-oriented workload) traces, and they demonstrate the potential of our approach under different scenarios. From a methodological point of view, we propose a general framework which is limited in scope, for the sake of simplicity in reading the paper, with a small number of SLAs, but the idea can be extended to many more SLAs and performance metrics. In this way, the user or the provider operating the cloud have more latitude, thanks to our multi-criteria approach, to control the workload without a sacrifice on performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-020-03231-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Dynamic sensor networks are characterized by large scale deployment, dynamic and unstructured topology, power limitations, less memory and limited computational capabilities. Sensor nodes deployed in real-time environment’s for sensing data have power-limitations which hampers the overall performance of WSNs. So, the only obvious solution is to propose an energy efficient routing protocol to optimize WSN real-time performance. Different specialists have proposed various directing conventions for WSNs dependent on Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, Meta-Heuristics, and other improvement strategies. However, every solution suggested till date has its advantages and limitations. In this paper, our primary objective is to utilize Swarm-Intelligence based approach i.e. “Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)”, for routing protocol development. Ant colony optimization (ACO) based approach gives optimal solution in terms of efficient routing path determination, energy efficiency and delivering high performance in terms of packet delivery and throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel energy efficient ACO based multipath routing protocol for WSN i.e. IEEMARP (Improvised Energy Efficient Multipath ACO based Routing Protocol). The proposed protocol works in three phases (Neighbor Discovery via Link Knowledge, Packet Transmission via exponentially weighted moving average method and ACKR packet delivery for assuring end-to-end delivery. To validate the performance of the protocol proposed, extensive simulations were conducted using NS-2.35-allinone simulator on diverse parameters like (PDR), throughput, routing overhead, energy consumption and end-to-end delay. In addition to this, the performance of protocol is compared with traditional routing protocols like Basic ACO, DSDV and DSR and other ACO based WSN protocols like ACEAMR, AntChain, EMCBR, IACR, AntHQSeN, FACOR and ANTALG. Simulation based results, clearly states that as compared to Basic ACO, DSDV and DSR, the performance of WSN network is improvised to around 10% in all performance metrics via IEEMARP routing protocol. And as compared to ACEAMR, AntChain, EMCBR and IACR, IEEMARP performs 20% better in overall functionality and almost 10–12% better as compared to AntHQSeN, FACOR, ANTLAG routing protocols in varied WSN scenarios. It is also observed that IEEMARP protocol is highly efficient in TCP packet transmission from source to destination node.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-7627-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-020-2955-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many devices, once separate, can now be interacted with remotely, improving efficiency and organization. This, however, comes at the cost of rising security vulnerabilities. Vendors are competing to create and release quickly innovative connected objects, without focusing on the security issues. As a consequence, attacks involving smart devices, or targeting them, are proliferating, creating threats to user’s privacy and even their physical security. Additionally, the heterogeneous technologies involved in IoT make attempts to develop protection on smart devices much harder. Most of the intrusion detection systems developed for those platforms are based on network activity. However, on many systems, intrusions cannot easily or reliably be detected from network traces. We propose a novel host-based automated framework for intrusion detection. Our work combines user space and kernel space information and machine learning techniques to detect various kinds of intrusions in smart devices. Our solution use tracing techniques to automatically get devices behavior, process this data into numeric arrays to train several machine learning algorithms, and raise alerts whenever an intrusion is found. We implemented several machine learning algorithms, including deep learning ones, to achieve high detection capabilities, while adding little overhead on the monitored devices.

Driven by the paradigm shift towards more automation and more intelligent transportation, it is time to reimagine the vehicle-infrastructure ecosystem with the cold-climate issues in mind, and to enhance communications and coordination among various highway users and stakeholders. This commentary envisages the deployment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies to bring about transformative changes and substantial benefits in terms of enhanced winter safety and mobility on highways. At the center of the commentary is a conceptualized design of next-generation highways in cold climates, including the existing infrastructure entities that are appropriate for possible upgrade to connected infrastructure (CI) applications, to leverage the immensely expanded data availability fueled by better spatial and temporal coverage. The commentary also advances the idea that CI solutions can augment the sensing capabilities and confidence level of connected or autonomous vehicles. The application scenarios of VII system is then briefly explored, followed by some discussion of the paradigm shift towards V2X applications and a look to the future including some identified research needs in the arena of CI.

Besides micro-moment features extraction, we also experiment with a deep neural network architecture for efficient abnormality detection and classification. In the following, a novel anomaly visualization technique is introduced that is based on a scatter representation of the micro-moment classes, and hence providing consumers an easy solution to understand their abnormal behavior. Moreover, in order to validate the proposed system, a new energy consumption dataset at appliance level is also designed through a measurement campaign carried out at Qatar University Energy Lab, namely, Qatar University dataset. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets collected at two regions, which have extremely different climate conditions, confirm that the proposed deep micro-moment architecture outperforms other machine learning algorithms and can effectively detect anomalous patterns.

Therefore, seeking fast, automatic, less expensive and accurate methods to detect plant diseases is of great realistic significance. In this paper, we studied the transfer learning for the deep CNNs and modified the network structure to enhance the learning ability of the tiny lesion symptoms. The pre-trained MobileNet-V2 was extended with the classification activation map (CAM), which was used for visualization as well as plant lesion positioning, and both were selected in our approach.

Then, the yielded optimum model was used for identifying plant diseases. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. It achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.85% on the public dataset.

In order to deploy these systems in this category of the population, it is necessary to be able to carry out validation and experiments to improve efficiency, safety, user experience and reduce installation costs. Unfortunately, this type of experiment can be difficult to perform because of the difficulty in recruiting candidates and accessing adequate intelligent environments. These problems could be partially offset with simulators. These tools can be used to simulate the behavior of an intelligent environment and its occupants in order to generate data, or to observe and evaluate their behavior. However, to design systems for populations suffering from MCI or AD, it is necessary that the simulator be able to emulate the behavior of these persons. In this paper, two approaches to simulate and generate sequences of actions containing errors usually committed by persons with this type of disease are proposed. Those approaches aim to be simple to use and both are based on the use of behavior trees. The first one consists in adding nodes to a behavior tree to simulate errors with their specific probabilities. The second approach consists in defining an interval to bind the number of errors that can be inserted through the error injection algorithm. We also present the results of the experiments carried out to evaluate these approaches. For the first experiment, several simulations were conducted and were recorded in videos. These videos were analyzed by specialists in cognitive disorders who diagnosed the avatar of these videos. The second experiment aimed at comparing the two approaches together. To do so, several action sequences were generated. The results show that our model is able to generate healthy, MCI and Alzheimer’s behaviors.

The process of extracting driving patterns can be challenging due to issues such as the collection of valid data, clustering of population groups, and definition of similar behaviors. Naturalistic Driving methods provide a solution by allowing the collection of exhaustive datasets in quantitative and qualitative terms. However, exploiting and analyzing these datasets is complex and resource-intensive. Moreover, most of the previous studies, have constrained the great potential of naturalistic driving datasets to very specific situations, events, and/or road sections. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for extracting driving patterns from naturalistic driving data, even from small population samples. We use Geographic Information Systems (GIS), so we can evaluate drivers’ behavior and reactions to certain events or road sections, and compare across situations using different spatial scales. To that end, we analyze some kinematic parameters such as speeds, acceleration, braking, and other forces that define a driving attitude. Our method favors an adequate mapping of complete datasets enabling us to achieve a comprehensive perspective of driving performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-020-01653-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although many research works have been held on WSN-IoT, none of them is able to provide high-level security with energy efficiency. This paper resolves this problem by designing a novel Secure Deep Learning (SecDL) approach for dynamic cluster-based WSN-IoT networks. To improve energy efficiency, the network is designed to be Bi-Concentric Hexagons along with Mobile Sink technology. Dynamic clusters are formed within Bi-Hex network and optimal cluster heads are selected by Quality Prediction Phenomenon (QP 2 ) that ensure QoS and also energy efficiency. Data aggregation is enabled in each cluster and handled with a Two-way Data Elimination then Reduction scheme. A new One Time-PRESENT (OT-PRESENT) cryptography algorithm is designed to achieve high-level security for aggregated data. Then, the ciphertext is transmitted to mobile sink through optimal route to ensure high-level QoS. For optimal route selection, a novel Crossover based Fitted Deep Neural Network (Co-FitDNN) is presented. This work also concentrates on IoT-user security since the sensory data can be accessed by IoT users. This work utilizes the concept of data mining to authenticate the IoT users. All IoT users are authenticated by Apriori based Robust Multi-factor Validation algorithm which maps the ideal authentication feature set for each user. In this way, the proposed SecDL approach achieves security, QoS and energy efficiency.

Despite depicting positive results in a multitude of applications, incremental decision trees continuously grow in terms of nodes as new data becomes available, i.e., they eventually split on all features available, and also multiple times using the same feature, thus leading to unnecessary complexity and overfitting. With this behavior, incremental trees lose the ability to generalize well, be human-understandable, and be computationally efficient. To tackle these issues, we proposed in a previous study a regularization scheme for Hoeffding decision trees that (i) uses a penalty factor to control the gain obtained by creating a new split node using a feature that has not been used thus far and (ii) uses information from previous splits in the current branch to determine whether the gain observed indeed justifies a new split. In this paper, we extend this analysis and apply the proposed regularization scheme to other types of incremental decision trees and report the results in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. The main interest is to verify whether and how the proposed regularization scheme affects the different types of incremental trees. Results show that in addition to the original Hoeffding Tree, the Adaptive Random Forest also benefits from regularization, yet, McDiarmid Trees and Extremely Fast Decision Trees observe declines in accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12243-020-00782-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

None of the previous MAC schemes has been able to provide true pre-emption to the high priority data. This paper introduced a novel data fragmentation scheme for low priority traffic in order to improve the delay performance of high priority traffic in WSN. It is proposed that instead of transmitting the low priority packet as a single unit, it should be transmitted in small fragments with pauses. A MAC protocol FROG-MAC has been designed based on the proposed fragmentation scheme. Simulations over Contiki operating system and testbed experiments over TelosB/Tmote Sky Platform have been performed to evaluate performance of FROG-MAC based on parameters of delay and throughput/packet delivery ratio (PDR). It has been found that FROG-MAC improves the delay and throughput of urgent traffic by reducing its waiting time. For increase in the fragment size, the delay of urgent traffic increases, whereas that of normal traffic reduces. With the increasing network size, the delay for both traffic types increases, and PDR reduces due to the increased network traffic load, collision and retransmissions.

Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important part of IoT, and it is mainly responsible for acquiring and reporting data. As lifetime and coverage area of WSN directly determine IoT performance, how to design a method to conserve nodes energy and reduce nodes death rates become important issues. Sensor network clustering is one efficient method to solve these problems. It divides nodes into clusters and selects one to be cluster head (CH). The data transmission and communication within one cluster are managed by its CH. Many traditional strategies have been designed out, but because of network dynamic feature, machine learning methods become more attractive and many literature are working on them. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one evolutionary algorithm. Inspired by this algorithm, we propose a novel energy-aware bio-inspired clustering scheme (PSO-WZ). We firstly initialize CHs combination randomly and assign non-CHs based on division rules. Then, using the fitness function to guide the selection process until the maximum time is reached. Since the division rule is directly related with the network topology and node energy consumption distribution, we design it from two angles: non-CHs and the whole network, to save the energy of each node as much as possible. Meanwhile, in order to balance energy load among nodes, which contributes to lowering nodes reduction and preserving network coverage range, we introduce the Gini coefficient into the objective function. From the results obtained, we conclude that the proposed algorithm is able to keep more nodes alive over time, prolong the network life cycle, and improve the overall performance of IoT further.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-01704-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the precipitation and harsh weather, the underground environments change frequently, which make wireless communication in WUSNs much complicated than that in terrestrial over-the-air wireless sensor networks. To achieve reliable and energy-efficient data gathering in dynamic WUSNs , this article proposes an optimal transmission policy, where path loss of sensory data transmission, energy constraint, and network load balancing are the factors to be considered. Specifically, we capture the effect of underground environments on wireless communications, and evaluate path probability, energy consumption, and load balancing factor with respect to reliability and efficiency of transmission paths. The transmission topology can be reduced to a multi-objective and multi-constrained optimization problem and solved through an improved maximum flow minimum cost algorithm. By using reinforcement learning, we derive an adaptive transmission policy for underground sensors to efficiently use their energy and avoid transmitting sensory data in unreliable paths under a dynamic environment. Through simulations and comparison upon publicly available real data, our technique achieves more reliable wireless communication with significant reduction of packet loss, and enables more energy-efficient data gathering than other techniques, especially when soil moisture varies frequently.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-020-01443-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This study provides an overview of current applications of AI in disaster management during its four phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. It presents example applications of different AI techniques and their benefits for supporting disaster management at different phases, as well as some practical AI-based decision support tools.

It also roots out some of the major limitations of the cloud scenario where there exists the need for extremely low latency. Despite its compelling advantages, fog computing is still an evolving paradigm that demands further research. Among all the other issues prevalent in fog computing, security is one of the burning issues. Fog nodes, being at the edge of the network, pose several security threats. The authors have thus conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on security issues in fog computing scenario. Initially, the prevalent security issues are identified through an in-depth survey and then the available literature per security issue is analyzed systematically. This SLR reveals that the security in/through fog scenario is being addressed by the researchers all over the globe. But, the approaches with respect to fog environment still lack methods to evaluate security aspects.

Nowadays, the ""Internet of Things Ecosystem"" term is being used more often that emphasizes its complex internal structure and functionality. Based on the available standards on the IoT’s generalized architecture and reference model, the IoT ecosystem is presented as a security object to be protected. Numerous security controls, collecting raw data for complex and multi-stage processing and further detection of events related to information security (IS), are located on its layers. The IS incident management process with different routine actions for the IoT ecosystems needs automation, for which Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are the best applicable solutions.

Besides, the amount of network attacks also increased. Accordingly, there is an urgent demand to design a defence system proficient in discovering new kinds of attacks. One of the most effective protection systems is intrusion detection system (IDS). The IDS is an intelligent system that monitors and inspects the network packets to identify the abnormal behavior. In addition, the network packets comprise many attributes and there are many attributes that are irrelevant and repetitive which degrade the performance of the IDS system and overwhelm the system resources. A feature selection technique helps to reduce the computation time and complexity by selecting the optimum subset of features. In this paper, an enhanced anomaly-based IDS model based on multi-objective grey wolf optimisation (GWO) algorithm was proposed. The GWO algorithm was employed as a feature selection mechanism to identify the most relevant features from the dataset that contribute to high classification accuracy. Furthermore, support vector machine was used to estimate the capability of selected features in predicting the attacks accurately. Moreover, 20% of NSL–KDD dataset was used to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach through different attack scenarios. The experimental result revealed that the proposed approach obtains classification accuracy of (93.64%, 91.01%, 57.72%, 53.7%) for DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R attack respectively.

A physical thing can be created by this inventive perception to signify itself in the digital world. Regarding the physical things that are related to the internet, it is worth noting that considering numerous theories and upcoming predictions, they mostly require protected structures, moreover, they are at risk of several attacks. IoTs are endowed with particular routing disobedience called sinkhole attack owing to their distributed features. In these attacks, a malicious node broadcasts illusive information regarding the routings to impose itself as a route towards specific nodes for the neighboring nodes and thus, attract data traffic. RPL (IP-V6 routing protocol for efficient and low-energy networks) is a standard routing protocol which is mainly employed in sensor networks and IoT. This protocol is called SoS-RPL consisting of two key sections of the sinkhole detection. In the first section rating and ranking the nodes in the RPL is carried out based on distance measurements. The second section is in charge of discovering the misbehavior sources within the IoT network through, the Average Packet Transmission RREQ (APT-RREQ). Here, the technique is assessed through wide simulations performed within the NS-3 environment. Based on the results of the simulation, it is indicated that the IoT network behavior metrics are enhanced based on the detection rate, false-negative rate, false-positive rate, packet delivery rate, maximum throughput, and packet loss rate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-020-07421-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Expectations of surgical outcomes are changing alongside demographic trends, whilst aftercare may be fractured as a result of resource limitations. Conventional assessments of health outcomes must evolve to keep up with these changing trends. Health outcomes may be assessed largely by self-report using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), such as the Oxford Hip or Oxford Knee Score, in the months up to and following surgery. Though widely used, many PROMs have methodological limitations and there is debate about how to interpret results and definitions of clinically meaningful change. With the development of a home-monitoring system, there is opportunity to characterise the relationship between PROMs and behaviour in a natural setting and to develop methods of passive monitoring of outcome and recovery after surgery. In this paper, we discuss the motivation and technology used in long-term continuous observation of movement, sleep and domestic routine for healthcare applications, such as the HEmiSPHERE project for hip and knee replacement patients. In this case study, we evaluate trends evident in data of two patients, collected over a 3-month observation period post-surgery, by comparison with scores from PROMs for sleep and movement quality, and by comparison with a third control home. We find that accelerometer and indoor localisation data correctly highlight long-term trends in sleep and movement quality and can be used to predict sleep and wake times and measure sleep and wake routine variance over time, whilst indoor localisation provides context for the domestic routine and mobility of the patient.

However, this development highlights the challenge of interoperability, because devices are heterogeneous and use different communication protocols and different data formats. For this reason, we propose a model for point-to-point integration in three-layer IoT applications: (a) hardware, which corresponds to the physical objects (controller, sensor and actuator), (b) communication, which is the bridge that allows the exchange of data between a MQTT queue and REST web services, and (c) integration, which establishes a sequence of transactions to coordinate the components of the system. For this purpose, a metamodel, a graphic editor and a code generator have been developed that allow the developer to design IoT systems formed by heterogeneous components without having in-depth knowledge of every hardware and software platform. In order to validate our proposal, a smart home scenario has been developed, with a series of sensors and actuators that combined show a complex behavior.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-020-03150-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Self-adaptive systems are usually built of a managed part, which implements their functionality, and a managing part, which implements the self-adaptive mechanisms. Hence, the complexity of self-adaptive systems results also from the existence of the managing part and the interaction between the managed and the managing parts. The available evaluation approaches of self-adaptive systems focus on their performances, i.e., on the benefits (e.g., degree of autonomy, support for detecting anomalous behavior, adaptivity time, quality of response) achieved through the self-adaptive mechanisms of the managing part. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of the design of self-adaptive systems (including the managed and the managing parts) as it is done in traditional software engineering. We are interested in the internal software quality of self-adaptive systems, as the existence of the managing part and its interaction with the managed part leads to a tightly coupled system. We analyze the self-adaptive systems through the detection of different issues such as architectural and code smells and the detection of design patterns. The smells provide some hints on possible design and implementation problems, and help software engineers to improve the quality of the systems. While, design patterns are usually indicators of the application of good practices in the software development and allow to capture part of the design rationale. In this way, they can help software engineers to understand, reuse, and extend self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we have considered the detection of 3 architectural smells, 18 code smells, and 15 design patterns in 11 self-adaptive systems written in the Java programming language. The results indicate that the 3 architectural smells, 9 out of the 18 code smells, and the 15 design patterns have been detected in all the analyzed self-adaptive systems.

Many traditional systems use windshield wipers which works intermittently and with variable speeds during rain. In majority of the vehicles an adjustable lever near the steering of the driver has to be operated by the driver to control the windshield wiper(s). This change of lever position will distract the driver’s attention, more so during poor visibility that may lead to untoward incidents. To overcome the above problem, the windshield’s working in this scenario needs to be modified to fully automatic. In this paper, we have designed and developed an inexpensive and fully automatic windshield wiper system using Texas instruments CC3200 XL-Launchpad, Rain sensor YL-63, GSM SIM900A Module and Thing speak cloud.

Contexts change continuously because of objective reasons, such as economic situation, political matter and social issues. The adoption of big data analytics by businesses is facilitating such change at an even faster rate in much complicated ways. The potential benefits of embedding contextual information into an application are already evidenced by the improved outcomes of the existing context-aware methods in those applications. Since big data is growing very rapidly, context awareness in big data analytics has become more important and timely because of its proven efficiency in big data understanding and preparation, contributing to extracting the more and accurate value of big data. Many surveys have been published on context-based methods such as context modelling and reasoning, workflow adaptations, computational intelligence techniques and mobile ubiquitous systems. However, to our knowledge, no survey of context-aware methods on big data analytics for business applications supported by enterprise level software has been published to date. To bridge this research gap, in this paper first, we present a definition of context, its modelling and evaluation techniques, and highlight the importance of contextual information for big data analytics. Second, the works in three key business application areas that are context-aware and/or exploit big data analytics have been thoroughly reviewed.

CPS functionality has intrinsic characteristics including considerable heterogeneity, variable dynamics, and complexity of operation. These systems also typically have insufficient resources to satisfy their full demand for specialized services such as data edge storage, data fusion, and reasoning. These novel CPS characteristics require new management strategies to support the resilient global operation of CPSs. To reach this goal, we propose a Software Defined Networking based solution scaled out by Network Function Virtualization modules implemented as distributed management agents. Considering the obvious need for orchestrating the distributed agents towards the satisfaction of a common set of global CPS functional goals, we analyze distinct incentive strategies to enact a cooperative behavior among the agents. The repeated operation of each agent’s local algorithm allows that agent to learn how to adjust its behavior following both its own experience and observed behavior in neighboring agents.

Traditionally, separate urban sensing applications are designed to monitor different urban dynamics like environment, transportation, mobility, etc. However, combining these applications to aggregate information can lead to various new inferences. The main objective of this work is to improve urban sensing applications by overcoming their individual limitations. A unified framework called JUSense (Judicious Urban Sensing) is proposed that can derive benefits from these applications by combining their functionalities. JUSense provides the opportunity for applications to tackle the challenges associated with data collection, aggregation of data in cloud, calibration, data cleaning, and prediction. A multi-view fusion model is proposed for spatiotemporal urban air and noise pollution map generation. Further, a random forest classifier is built to classify the driving events. Here, large scale experiments are performed to evaluate the efficacy of JUSense on real-world dataset.

Recently, a spatiotemporal probabilistic model was built for TOP to estimate the leaving probability of parking cars, and relevant algorithms were applied to search for the optimal path for a parking officer to maximize the collection of parking fines from cars in violation. However, there are often multiple parking officers on duty during business hours in the central business district, which provides us with the opportunities to introduce cooperation among officers for efficient car-parking management. The multiple travelling officers problem (MTOP) is a more complex problem than the TOP because multiple officers are involved simultaneously in paths construction. In this study, the MTOP is formulated and new components are established for solving the problem. One essential component called the leader-based random-keys encoding scheme (LERK) is developed for the representation of possible solutions. Then, cuckoo search (CS), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are implemented using the proposed components and compared with other state-of-the-art GA and PSO using other solution encoding schemes to solve MTOP.

Hence, it seems reasonable to merge the advantages of both approaches using a hybrid model of knowledge representation. The model output presents an estimation of the number of resources to be deployed if an emergency occurs. The proposed approaches for both the knowledge representation structure and the inference algorithm have proved to improve the accuracy of recommendation in emergencies. The results show that our hybrid system approach is efficient in decision support. The ontology-supported hybrid reasoning approach is also further validated using subjective evaluation.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12243-020-00786-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It has several important applications in traffic congestion forecasting, location-based routing protocol designs and targeting advertisements generation, etc. Mobility prediction (aka route prediction) consists of forecasting future routes to be traversed by a vehicle. Several models have been proposed for route prediction. These models are generally probabilistic models (e.g., Markov models) or data mining-based models (e.g., sequential rule-based models), and are trained with historical location data. Although these models were shown to perform well, one important drawback is that they are lossy. In other words, a large amount of information found in the location data is discarded by their training processes. Consequently, these models do not perform well for predicting routes where detailed information is required to perform accurate predictions. Besides, several prediction models assume the Markovian hypothesis that the next location of a user only depends on his/her current location and any previous movement of the user is ignored in prediction. This hypothesis has been employed, such as in Lian et al. (ACM Trans Intell Syst Technol 6:1–27, 2015 . https://doi.org/10.1145/2629557 ), as a simplifying assumption because it allows building models having a small size. However, this assumption is often unrealistic and thus greatly decreases the accuracy of route prediction. Moreover, these models are noise sensitive as they do not tolerate the smallest deviation in location data principally prone to several disturbances and uncertainty issues. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel route prediction model named NextRoute . The proposed model is lossless as it compresses location data in a prediction tree without information loss, and it is designed to use all the relevant information contained in the training data to perform prediction. In contrast to some other proposals, NextRoute provides efficient noise tolerance strategy that loosened the similarity measure when matching the current trajectory of vehicle with historical data. An extensive experimental evaluation was conducted with real-world and synthetic datasets providing quite encouraging results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-019-01327-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of this study is twofold. By analyzing a large dataset of signals collected by these devices, we identify significant clusters of similar behavior patterns related to user physical activities. We then examine specific patterns of step count in the context of recommendation of habits that more likely give rise to weight loss effects.

Botnets are a common threat that takes advantage of the lack of basic security tools in IoT devices and can perform a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Developing new methods to detect compromised IoT devices is urgent in order to mitigate the negative consequences of these IoT botnets since the existing IoT botnet detection methods still present some issues, such as, relying on labelled data, not being validated with newer botnets, and using very complex machine learning algorithms. Anomaly detection methods are promising for detecting IoT botnet attacks since the amount of available normal data is very large. One of the powerful algorithms that can be used for anomaly detection is One Class Support vector machine (OCSVM). The efficiency of the OCSVM algorithm depends on several factors that greatly affect the classification results such as the subset of features that are used for training OCSVM model, the kernel type, and its hyperparameters. In this paper, a new unsupervised evolutionary IoT botnet detection method is proposed. The main contribution of the proposed method is to detect IoT botnet attacks launched form compromised IoT devices by exploiting the efficiency of a recent swarm intelligence algorithm called Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO) to optimize the hyperparameters of the OCSVM and at the same time to find the features that best describe the IoT botnet problem. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, its performance is evaluated using typical anomaly detection evaluation measures over a new version of a real benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all other algorithms in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate, and G-mean for all IoT device types.

Such form is increasingly being directed towards tackling the challenges of sustainability in the light of the escalating urbanization trend. This paper investigates how the emerging data-driven smart city is being practiced and justified in terms of the development and implementation of its innovative applied solutions for sustainability. To illuminate this new urban phenomenon, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology to examine and compare London and Barcelona as the leading data-driven smart cities in Europe. This study shows that these cities have a high level of the development of applied data-driven technologies, but they slightly differ in the level of the implementation of such technologies in different city systems and domains with respect to sustainability areas. They also moderately differ in the degree of their readiness as to the availability and development level of the competences and infrastructure needed to generate, transmit, process, and analyze large masses of data to extract useful knowledge for enhanced decision making and deep insights pertaining to urban operational functioning, management, and planning in relation to sustainability.

Substantial progress has been made on deep learning models in the image, text, and audio domains, and notable efforts have been recently dedicated to the design of deep networks in the video domain. We discuss the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) and its pipelines for the exploration of video features, various fusion strategies, and their performances; we also discuss the limitations of CNN for long-term motion cues and the use of sequential learning models such as long short-term memory to overcome these limitations. In addition, we address various multi-model approaches for extracting important cues and score fusion techniques from hybrid deep learning frameworks. Then, we highlight future plans in this domain, recent trends, and substantial challenges for video understanding.

One viable application is the performance monitoring of university students. The data received from the radio frequency identification tags can be collected and crunched for making quick, accurate real-time decision. An attempt is made to classify the students based on their academic performance using a few path-breaking machine learning algorithms. The accurate classification of students’ performance under different categories is bound to facilitate grade-based teaching and training for specific students. To achieve this, a novel classification mechanism based on adaptive linear regression algorithm is proposed and implemented using Java. To verify and validate the performance of the proposed adaptive linear regression based classification, the performance metrics of the existing classifiers such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbourhood, Ada Boost, decision table, decision trees, random forest, linear regression and multi class classifier algorithm are compared. From the results, it is confirmed that the metrics such as correlation co-efficient, precision, F1 score, mean absolute error, root mean square error, relative absolute error, root relative squared error, recall, receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curves are found to be better for the proposed adaptive linear regression based classification.

There are new needs and opportunities for recommender systems to develop new models/approaches to support QS application users. Recommender systems can help to more easily identify relevant artifacts for users and thus improve user experiences. Currently recommender systems are widely and effectively used in the e-commerce domain (e.g., online music services, online bookstores). Next-generation QS applications could include more recommender tools for assisting the users of QS systems based on their personal self-tracking data streams from wearable electronics, biosensors, mobile phones, genomic data, and cloud-based services. In this paper, we propose three new recommendation approaches for QS applications: Virtual Coach , Virtual Nurse , and Virtual Sleep Regulator which help QS users to improve their health conditions. Virtual Coach works like a real fitness coach to recommend personalized work-out plans whereas Virtual Nurse considers the medical history and health targets of a user to recommend a suitable physical activity plan. Virtual Sleep Regulator is specifically designed for insomnia (a kind of sleep disorder) patients to improve their sleep quality with the help of recommended physical activity and sleep plans.

Conspicuously, this research aims at predicting the forest fires to minimize the loss and immediate actions in the direction of safety. Specifically, this research proposes an energy efficient IoT framework backed by fog-cloud computing technology for early prediction of wildfires. Initially, Jaccard similarity analysis is used to determine the redundant data acquired from IoT devices in real-time. This data is analyzed at fog computing layer and reduces multi-dimensional data to single value termed as Vulnerability Index. Finally, Artificial Neural Network is used to predict the vulnerability on forest region based on Wildfire Causing Parameters.

In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient method for gait recognition.

Urban transport includes passenger and freight vehicles, which have different behavior, and the need for such a separation is often ignored in research and practice [ 1 ]. New digital data sources provide an opportunity to better understand urban transport and identify where policy interventions are required. We review the literature on digital counting techniques to monitor transport flows, including loops, Automatic-Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras and floating car data. We further investigate the potential of ANPR cameras, which are widely deployed, and which can be augmented with vehicle category information. This article presents the methodology that we follow for transforming raw augmented ANPR camera data into practical knowledge for city planners.

We demonstrate our methodology on a case study for the Mechelen-Willebroek district in Belgium, encompassing augmented data from 122 ANPR cameras for a period of two weeks. Additionally, we also look at the car-reduced zone and how time restrictions affect the different vehicle categories’ actions.

The real-time prediction of spatial information is promising for next-generation mobile networks. Recent developments in machine learning technology have enabled prediction of spatial information, which will be quite useful for smart mobility services including navigation, driving assistance, and self-driving. Other key enablers for forming spatial information are image sensors in mobile devices like smartphones and tablets and in vehicles such as cars and drones and real-time cognitive computing like automatic number/license plate recognition systems and object recognition systems. However, since image data collected by mobile devices and vehicles need to be delivered to the server in real time to extract input data for real-time prediction, the uplink transmission speed of mobile networks is a major impediment. This paper proposes a framework of data assessment and prioritization that reduces the uplink traffic volume while maintaining the prediction accuracy of spatial information. In our framework, machine learning is used to estimate the importance of each data element and to predict spatial information under the limitation of available data. A numerical evaluation using an actual vehicle mobility dataset demonstrated the validity of the proposed framework. Two extension schemes in our framework, which use the ensemble of importance scores obtained from multiple feature selection methods, are also presented to improve its robustness against various machine learning and feature selection methods.

However, such open in-network caching is vulnerable to network anomalies. In particular, cache pollution attack disrupts the smooth working of in-network caching by flooding unpopular contents. Hence, the in-network caching malfunctions and legitimate consumer requests are dropped. To address this problem, a secure framework based on Fuzzy Restricted Boltzmann Machine has been proposed to detect the anomalies and defend against such pollution attacks in ICN. Further, a reward-based cache replacement (ReBac) algorithm that is capable of avoiding cache pollution attack has also been proposed.

To understand their implications, in this paper, data-intensive approaches for sustainability will be explored by conducting an extensive review. The current data-intensive approaches are defined as an amalgamation of traditional data-collection methods, such as surveys and data from monitoring networks, with new data-collection methods that involve new information communication technology. Based on a comprehensive review of the current data-intensive approaches for sustainability, key challenges are identified: the lack of data availability, diverse indicators developed from a narrowly viewed base, diverse definitions and values, skewed global representation, and the lack of social and economic information collected, especially among the business indicators. To clarify the implications of these trends, four major research assumptions regarding data-intensive approaches are elaborated: the methodology, epistemology, normativity, and ontology. Caution is required when data-intensive approaches are masked as “objective”. Overcoming this issue requires interdisciplinary and community-based approaches that can offer ways to address the subjectivities of data-intensive approaches.

However, today’s research and development activities rely on multimedia-based services and applications while this kind of applications has several requirements in terms of storage, bandwidth, latency, etc. Furthermore, protocols dedicated to IoT applications have proved their weakness in multimedia environments. Hence, a new paradigm called internet of multimedia things (IoMT) has been proposed to fulfill the requirements of multimedia applications. In this paradigm different multimedia things can interact and cooperate with each other over the Internet. Moreover, IETF ROLL working group standardized an IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL for LLNs) for resource constrained devices.

Thanks to behavior monitoring, mobile, and ubiquitous information systems in the areas of e-health, home automation, and smart cities are becoming more and more “smart,” being able to dynamically adapt themselves to the current users’ context and situation. However, human behavior is characterized by large variability due to individual habits, physical disabilities or cognitive impairment. This aspect makes behavior monitoring a challenging task. On the one side, execution variability makes it hard to acquire sufficiently large activity datasets needed by supervised learning methods. On the other side, being based on a strict definition of activities in terms of constituting simpler actions, existing knowledge-based frameworks fall short in adapting to the specific characteristics of the subject. Hence, the variability of activity execution by different subjects calls for personalized methods to capture human activities and interaction in smart spaces at a fine-grained level. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel hybrid reasoning framework to capture fine-grained interaction with smart objects considering the specific features of individuals. Our model has its roots in the well-founded psychological theory of affordances, i.e., those features of an object that naturally explain its possible uses and how it should be used. The core of the framework is the ontological model of smart objects affordance, expressed through the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language. Through a use case in pervasive healthcare, we show how our framework can be applied to personalized recognition of abnormal behaviors. In particular, we tackle a particularly challenging issue: how to recognize early behavioral symptoms of mild cognitive impairment in subjects with physical disabilities. Moreover, an extensive experimental evaluation with real-world datasets acquired from 24 subjects shows the effectiveness of our framework in recognizing human activities and fine-grained manipulative gestures in different pervasive computing environments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-019-01357-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This framework realizes clustering of resident density by using the cellular networks and Wi-Fi connections and calculating the damage status of buildings through the designed and specifically implemented IoT unit data.

However, the increasing users’ requirements of migrating tasks pose a challenge to preserve the security and integrity of offloaded data which are processed by cloudlets. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-based cloudlet management method for multimedia workflow, named MWSM, is proposed in this paper. Technically, we first model each multimedia application as a multimedia workflow and formulate the multimedia workflow scheduling problem. Then, blockchain is adopted to secure the data integrity during the offloading procedure. Besides, NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) is employed to realize the QoS enhancement and ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choix Tradulsant la REaltite) is utilized to solve the decision-making problems of the most optimal scheduling strategies.

However, offensive network traffic such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) plays a significant role in threatening the cloud-based services. Therefore, defense for such attacks is required to save the cloud resources. Most of the attribute selection approaches for request classification are based on static threshold statistics. These statistics are the default values used to reduce the dimensionality of data. However, these default statistics do not work well with varying network conditions and for different intensities of DDoS attack. Therefore, an adaptive statistic is required to deal with different network and incoming traffic conditions. This paper also gives an comprehensive analysis of TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol-based DDoS attack and its effects on the cloud network. Based on the analysis and above issues, this paper presents an adaptive hybrid approach for attribute selection and classification of incoming traffic. The proposed approach consists of three subsystems such as (1) preprocessing subsystem, (2) adaptive attribute selection subsystem and (3) detection and prevention subsystem. The work utilizes NSL-KDD dataset which helps in the evaluation of the proposed approach. It is concluded that the combination of Mean Absolute Deviation technique with Random Forest classifier (MAD-RF) outperforms the other combinations. Therefore, MAD-RF is selected for further analysis. MAD-RF is also capable of dealing with TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol-based DDoS attack.

The computing resources of the mobile devices are limited as they are restricted with physical size, battery capacity, etc. In order to release the resource limitation, cloudlet, an effective paradigm, is introduced to host the computing tasks offloaded from the mobile devices. Compared with the cloud computing, the cloudlets are deployed closer to provide customers with fewer task offloading delay. Currently, the offloaded task scale is increasing, which generates large quantities of energy exposure for task implementation among cloudlets. Taking advantage of live virtual machine (VM) migration technology, the energy consumption of cloudlets could be definitely reduced. But such migration across cloudlets also decreases the implementation performance of the tasks. Therefore, it is still a challenge to jointly optimize the execution performance and the energy consumption for cloudlet management in WMAN. In this paper, a novel virtual machine (VM) scheduling method is proposed to balance the implantation time and the energy consumption to cope with the above challenge. Specifically, a collection of available migration polices are obtained through heuristically searching of destination cloudlets for the running computing tasks. Then, simple additive weighting (SAW) and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are leveraged to select the optimal VM scheduling strategy across cloudlets in WMAN. Finally, experimental results and evaluations validate our proposed method is both effective and feasible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-019-01242-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The IoV users can offload their computing tasks to the edge computing devices (ECDs) for low latency execution and the cloud can be engaged to process big data with sufficient computing resources. Though galactic convenience brought by the IoV cloud-edge computing system, it remains a challenge to manage the resource of ECDs by reducing the energy and time consumption while avoiding the situation of overload or underload of the ECDs to maintain the system-stability. Moreover, during the movement of the vehicles, the computing tasks and data may be uploaded to different ECDs and the data continuity may be destroyed. In this paper, a multi-objective computation offloading method (MOC) for IoV in cloud-edge computing is proposed to deal with the challenges above. A vehicle-to-vehicle communication-based route obtaining algorithm is designed first. Then, in order to ensure the trustworth of the IoV data, which ECD to upload the computing tasks to is selected. Under the case that all ECDs are overloaded, the computation offloading between ECDs and cloud is considered. In addition, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to realize the multi-objective optimization of decreasing the load balancing rate and reduce the energy consumption in ECDs and shorten the time during processing the computing tasks.

Machine and deep learning networks, therefore, are required to be in a form that is safe and deterministic in their development and also in their deployment. The viability of non-random weight initialisation schemes in neural networks make the network more deterministic in learning sessions which is a desirable property in safety critical systems where deep learning is applied to smart city applications and where public liability is a concern. The paper uses a variety of schemes over number ranges and gradients and achieved a 98.09% accuracy figure, + 0.126% higher than the original random number scheme at 97.964%. The paper highlights that in this case, it is the number range and not the gradient that is affecting the achieved accuracy most dominantly, although there can be a coupling of number range with activation functions used. Unexpectedly in this paper, an effect of numerical instability was discovered from run to run when run on a multi-core CPU. The paper also has shown the enforcement of consistent deterministic results on an multi-core CPU by defining atomic critical code regions, and that aids repeatable information assurance in model fitting (or learning sessions). That enforcement of consistent repeatable determinism has also a benefit to accuracy even for the random schemes, and a highest score of 98.29%, + 0.326% higher than the baseline was achieved. However, also the non-random initialisation scheme causes weight arrangements after learning to be more structured which has benefits for validation in safety critical applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40860-019-00097-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In centralized computational systems, hyperparameter optimization and regularization techniques such as dropout are computational means to enhance learning performance by adjusting the deep hierarchical structure. However, in decentralized deep learning by the Internet of Things, the structure is an actual network of autonomous interconnected devices such as smart phones that interact via complex network protocols. Self-adaptation of the learning structure is a challenge. Uncertainties such as network latency, node and link failures or even bottlenecks by limited processing capacity and energy availability can significantly downgrade learning performance. Network self-organization and self-management is complex, while it requires additional computational and network resources that hinder the feasibility of decentralized deep learning. In contrast, this paper introduces a self-adaptive learning approach based on holarchic learning structures for exploring, mitigating and boosting learning performance in distributed environments with uncertainties. A large-scale performance analysis with 864,000 experiments fed with synthetic and real-world data from smart grid and smart city pilot projects confirm the cost-effectiveness of holarchic structures for decentralized deep learning.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-019-02906-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Real-time monitoring of gully and drainage blockage is an important part of flood monitoring applications. Building viable IoT sensors for detecting blockage is a complex task due to the limitations of deploying such sensors in situ. Image classification with deep learning is a potential alternative solution. However, there are no image datasets of gullies and drainages. We were faced with such challenges as part of developing a flood monitoring application in a European Union-funded project. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification approach based on deep learning with an IoT-enabled camera to monitor gullies and drainages. This approach utilises deep learning to develop an effective image classification model to classify blockage images into different class labels based on the severity. In order to handle the complexity of video-based images, and subsequent poor classification accuracy of the model, we have carried out experiments with the removal of image edges by applying image cropping. The process of cropping in our proposed experimentation is aimed to concentrate only on the regions of interest within images, hence leaving out some proportion of image edges. An image dataset from crowd-sourced publicly accessible images has been curated to train and test the proposed model. For validation, model accuracies were compared considering model with and without image cropping. The cropping-based image classification showed improvement in the classification accuracy. This paper outlines the lessons from our experimentation that have a wider impact on many similar use cases involving IoT-based cameras as part of smart city event monitoring platforms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40860-020-00099-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The process and results of the systematic review are presented which aims to answer the following research questions: what are the different types of physical sensor data errors, how to quantify or detect those errors, how to correct them and what domains are the solutions in. Out of 6970 literatures obtained from three databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect) using the search string refined via topic modelling, 57 publications were selected and examined. Results show that the different types of sensor data errors addressed by those papers are mostly missing data and faults e.g. outliers, bias and drift. The most common solutions for error detection are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) which accounts for about 40% of all error detection papers found in the study. Similarly, for fault correction, PCA and ANN are among the most common, along with Bayesian Networks. Missing values on the other hand, are mostly imputed using Association Rule Mining. Other techniques include hybrid solutions that combine several data science methods to detect and correct the errors. Through this systematic review, it is found that the methods proposed to solve physical sensor data errors cannot be directly compared due to the non-uniform evaluation process and the high use of non-publicly available datasets.

With scattered renewable energy resources and loads, multi-agent systems are a viable tool for controlling and improving the operation of microgrids. They are autonomous systems, where agents interact together to optimize decisions and reach system objectives. This paper presents an overview of multi-agent systems for microgrid control and management. It discusses design elements and performance issues, whereby various performance indicators and optimization algorithms are summarized and compared in terms of convergence time and performance in achieving system objectives. It is found that Particle Swarm Optimization has a good convergence time, so it is combined with other algorithms to address optimization issues in microgrids. Further, information diffusion and consensus algorithms are explored, and according to the literature, many variants of average-consensus algorithm are used to asynchronously reach an equilibrium. Finally, multi-agent system for multi-microgrid service restoration is discussed. Throughout the paper, challenges and research gaps are highlighted in each section as an opportunity for future work.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10462-019-09695-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, an IoT-enabled health/accessibility monitoring service can be consulted by its users to query about the status of different areas so as to optimize their trip throughout a geographic region. Given the high cost associated with a vast deployment of totally trusted information sources, the IoT-enabled monitoring services also subsist on citizen engagement and on (possibly untrusted) users sensing apparatus for data collection. However, trust management becomes a key factor in the success of such services because they might be misled by malicious users through altered or fake sensor data. In this paper, we consider a monitoring service and propose a hybrid entity/data trust computation scheme which relies on Bayesian learning to score the users (as data reporters), and on Dempster–Shafer theory (DST) for data fusion and for the computation of the trustworthiness of the data itself. In order to provide resiliency against behavioral changes, the probability masses used in DST are dynamically updated using the freshly estimated user scores as well as the contextual properties associated with the reported data. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our scheme. Compared to prior work, the results demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy and resilience against malicious behavior.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10207-019-00446-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Conventional IDS cannot be applied directly in IoT networks due to various communication architectures, standards, technologies, and environment specific services. The main problem with current IDS and handling techniques is that they can’t adapt to service changes in real-time. To overcome this open challenge, adaptive hybrid IDS based on timed automata controller approach is proposed in this paper. Proposed Hybrid IDS have additional knowledge in relation to frequent multimedia file formats and use this knowledge to carry out a comprehensive analysis of packets carrying multimedia files. Crowd sourcing online repository for signature based malicious pattern set generation is designed and self-tuning timed automaton is developed to detect the intruder in IoT networks. From the experimental results, it is evident that our proposed method, an adaptive hybrid IDS suit smart city applications and are accurate (99.06%) in detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, control hijacking attacks, zero day attacks, and replay attacks in IoT environments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-7495-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the reconstruction quality degrades appreciably as the measurement rate decreases for existing CS methods. To address this problem, we propose a half-precision CS framework for end-to-end person Re-ID named HCS4ReID, which efficiently recoveries detailed features of the person-of-interest regions in video frames. HCS4ReID supports half-precision CS sampling, transmitting and storing CS measurements with half-precision floats, and CS reconstruction with two measurement rates. Extensive experiments implemented on the PRW dataset indicate that the proposed HCS4ReID achieves 1.55 $$\times$$ × speedups over the single-precision counterpart on average for the CS sampling on an Intel HD Graphics 530, and only half-network bandwidth and storage space are needed to transmit and store the generated CS measurements. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed HCS4ReID is a scalable and portable CS framework with two measurement rates, and suitable for end-to-end person Re-ID. Especially, it achieves the comparable performance on the reconstructed PRW dataset against CS reconstruction with single-precision floats and a single measurement rate.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04424-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Considering the huge growth of smart objects and their applications, the need to collect and analyze their product data are becoming one of the main challenges. Sensor nodes are powered by batteries, efficient operations in term of energy are critical. Toward that end, it is desirable for a sensor node to eliminate redundancies in the received data from the neighboring nodes before transferring the final data to the central station. Data aggregation is one of the influential techniques in elimination of data redundancy and improvement of energy efficiency; also it increases the lifespan of Wireless Sensor Networks. In addition, the efficient data aggregation protocol can reduce network traffic. When a specific objective takes place in a specific area, it might be detected by more than one sensor. Considering the main challenges and aspects of data aggregation in wireless sensor networks, a review on different types of data aggregation techniques and protocols are presented in this paper. The ultimate objective of this study is to make the basic foundations to develop new advanced designs based on data integration techniques and clustering that have been proposed so far.

However, at the same time, this has resulted in the emergence of conflict and hate, making online environments uninviting for users. Although researchers have found that hate is a problem across multiple platforms, there is a lack of models for online hate detection using multi-platform data. To address this research gap, we collect a total of 197,566 comments from four platforms: YouTube, Reddit, Wikipedia, and Twitter, with 80% of the comments labeled as non-hateful and the remaining 20% labeled as hateful. We then experiment with several classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) and feature representations (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT, and their combination). While all the models significantly outperform the keyword-based baseline classifier, XGBoost using all features performs the best (F1 = 0.92). Feature importance analysis indicates that BERT features are the most impactful for the predictions. Findings support the generalizability of the best model, as the platform-specific results from Twitter and Wikipedia are comparable to their respective source papers.

This intelligence then, at least as a goal, is used to serve the needs of the citizens better, making the everyday operations more efficient and adaptive. Many recent successes of supervised machine learning make it an auspicious tool; however, the long-term vision of smart cities clearly requires technology that goes beyond that. The data collected based on the current operation of the system does not in itself contain information about possible improvements. The next generation of smart cities undoubtedly lies with the systems that build towards autonomous and semi-autonomous “knowledge creation.” They can self-improve and adapt to changing conditions and expectations. They must handle situations that were not anticipated during their design. Such construction of knowledge can be illustrated with the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom hierarchy.

Smart data can be used in a variety of smart city applications, but difficulties in managing such data are pushing smart cities toward the adoption of data management frameworks. Many studies have brought into focus the importance of these frameworks as they combine data collection, processing, analysis, management, and visualization and provide privacy and security features for different smart city applications, i.e., transportation, to promote a better quality of life. This chapter highlights key components of the data management framework, reviews various smart city applications, and discusses privacy and security challenges associated with smart city data. From the perspective of data frameworks, it is seen that the data used in smart city applications is unstructured coming from heterogeneous sources, i.e., sensors and social media, besides others. Therefore, the collection, processing, analysis, management, and visualization of such data are challenging. To perform these tasks, recent technologies, i.e., Internet of Things (IoT), sensor networks, machine learning, etc., have been used. Moreover, the use of smart data for smart government and governance provides several facilities for the public and business. The smart data is revolutionizing the daily communication of users along with their mode of transportation by introducing Social IoT (SIoT) and autonomous vehicles.

To illuminate this urban phenomenon, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology to investigate London and Barcelona as the leading data-driven smart cities in Europe. This study shows that these cities have a high level of the development of applied data-driven technologies, but they slightly differ in the level of the implementation of such technologies in different city systems and domains with respect to the different areas of sustainability. They also moderately differ in the degree of their readiness as to the availability and development level of the competences and infrastructure needed to generate, transmit. process, and analyze large masses of data to extract useful knowledge for enhanced decision making and deep insights pertaining to a wide variety of practical uses and applications in relation to sustainability.

Data-driven smart sustainable cities are becoming even more complex with the very technologies being used to understand and deal with them in terms of their operational functioning, management, planning, and design. Therefore, there is a need for more innovative solutions and sophisticated approaches as to the way such cities can be monitored, understood, and analyzed so as to be more efficiently planned and designed and more effectively operated and managed in line with the long-term vision of sustainability. This chapter examines data-driven smart sustainable urbanism, focusing on new urban intelligence functions and related processes, systems, and sciences. Further, it proposes and illustrates a conceptual framework for data-driven smart sustainable cities on the basis of advanced technologies and data-intensive approaches to science. To achieve these aims, a thematic analysis method is adopted to cope with the vast body of the multidisciplinary literature. We conclude that urban intelligence functions as new conceptions of how data-driven smart sustainable cities function play a pivotal role in facilitating the synergy between urban planning, design, management, and operational functioning in terms of producing the expected benefits of sustainability. The proposed framework represents a conceptual structure intended to serve as a guide for building a model of data-driven smart sustainable cities that can expand the structure into something useful on the basis of further qualitative analyses, empirical investigations, and practical implementations.

As a result, a lot of accidents happen heavily due to not wearing helmet on motorcycles, and not following the safety measures prescribed by the traffic police department of the nation. To overcome this challenge, this solution will act as a helping hand for the policemen in controlling the traffic. The solution will detect the riders for the helmet, and help the policemen to get an actual glimpse of the helmet-wearing status in the city and better control the traffic accidents and enforce the traffic rules.

Although offline air-quality monitoring using hand-held devices is common, online air-quality monitoring is still expensive and uncommon, especially in developing countries. The primary objective of this paper is to propose an online low-cost air-quality monitoring, prediction, and warning system (AQMPWS) which monitors, predicts, and warns about air-quality in real-time. The AQMPWS monitors and predict seven pollutants, namely, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone and Sulphur Dioxide. In addition, the AQMPWS monitors and predicts five weather variables, namely, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, and Wind Direction. The AQMPWS has its sensors connected to two microcontrollers in a Master-Slave configuration. The slave sends the data to the API in the cloud through an HTTP GET request via a GSM Module. A python-based web-application interacts with the API for visualization, prediction, and warning. Results show that the AQMPWS monitor different pollutants and weather variables within range specified by pollution control board. In addition, the AQMPWS predict the value of the pollutants and weather variables for the next 30-min given the current values of these pollutants and weather variables using an ensemble model containing a multilayer-perceptron and long short-term memory model. The AQMPWS is also able to warn stakeholders when any of the seven pollutants breach pre-defined thresholds.

This real-time data demonstrates whether additional attention to system is needed and requirements in terms of resources, performance, or improvements are being met. Cyber threat actors have become exceptionally skilled at infiltrating their victim targets. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are also recognized as attractive targets for threat actors. While these networks were generally thought to be more secure due to lack of connection to outside world of the corporate network or on the internet, now it is not the same case and attackers have managed to compromise them and steal valuable production data. Additionally, mechanical control can be undertaken or compromised, centrifugation can be dynamically rearranged or devices can be reprogrammed in order to accelerate or slow down ICS operations post such specialized attacks. This may result in total industrial equipment being destroyed or permanently damaged, or also may endanger personnel’s life who is working at the ICS site.

For addressing this urban cities air pollution problem, an attempt has been made in the present chapter by building a low cost and real time monitoring system using Internet of Things technology. The system uses gas sensor to detect pollutants such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, aromatic compounds etc. and consequently transfer the sensed data to microcontroller. The data is then transmitted through Internet to server using Wi-Fi module. The air quality in the vicinity of sensor can thus be recorded and proper counteraction could then be taken in case of high level of pollution.

As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity. It seems that these principles have taken the attention of the scientists to carry out more variety of research on the subject and to develop implementable and appropriate scenarios. A comprehensive taxonomy of Industry 4.0 can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-018-1433-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The Internet of Things provides many examples in which processing and analyzing data streams are critical success factors. With the growing amount of data, the usage of machine learning (ML) algorithms has become an essential part of data analysis. However, the high volume and velocity of data presents new challenges, which need to be addressed, e.g. frequent model changes, concept drift or insufficient time to train models. From our point of view, these challenges cannot be tackled alone by using an algorithm-centric approach, i.e. to focus solely on finding appropriate algorithms, and neglecting the structure of the overall processing system. Therefore, we propose a generic architectural framework, which describes common components and their interactions with each other in order to apply ML technologies to streaming data.

AI and automation are meant to make economies and societies “smarter”—more efficient, productive and convenient. Nevertheless, this proclaimed “progress” fosters deep fears of coming mass unemployment and a world run by machines for the benefit of a small human elite. Yet smart technology also holds the promise of ushering in a “post-work economy” where the need for labour is reduced and material scarcity is a thing of the past. However, for these utopian visions to be made into a reality requires the use of non-human capabilities and intelligence to create an economy that is as liberating as it is smart. And one that is not merely programmed by elites for the benefit of elites. This chapter critically uncovers the mutually reinforcing relationship between human and non-human empowerment. Far from the idea that AI and big data can only serve the interest of corporations and governments, it reveals the ways it can promote economic equality and inclusion in both big and small ways. Notably, it will highlight how these advances are already revolutionizing the ways organisations are managed, services are administered and communities are planned. It will then reveal the ways it also makes it easier to create not- for- profit organisations that combine the latest cutting edge technology such as digital fabrication, open sourcing and distributed manufacturing with values of radical democracy, equality and social justice. Looking ahead to the future, it concludes by arguing that the establishment of a progressive “post-capitalism” is not only possible but also crucial to the further advancement of non-human technology. Without such a fundamental economic revolution, its potential applications and development will be stifled and undermined by humans who feel they have been “left behind” by these changes.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36181-5_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to their extensive norm in our day-to-day wireless-enabled life, WLANs are expected to play a vital role for Internet of Things (IoT). It is predicted that by 2020, about 50 billion devices (things) will be connected via IoT. Consequently, WLANs need major improvements in both throughput and efficiency for such a massive device deployment in applications like smart offices, smart train stations, and smart stadiums for smart cities in IoT. New technologies continue to be introduced for WLAN applications for this purpose. The IEEE 802.11ac standard is the currently implemented amendment by the IEEE 802.11 standard working group that promises data rates at gigabits per second. The main features of the IEEE 802.11ac standard are adopting increased bandwidth and higher order modulation than the previous standards, and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) and multiuser MIMO transmission modes. These features are designed to improve the user experience. In addition to technologies that enhance the efficiency of the WLAN, the IEEE 802.11ax High Efficiency WLAN (HEW) standard is also investigating and evaluating advanced wireless technologies to utilize the existing spectrum more efficiently. The next-generation dense WLAN, HEW is expected to confront ultradense user environments and radically new applications for smart cities. HEW is likely to provide four times higher network efficiency even in highly dense network deployments. However, the current WLAN itself faces huge challenge of efficient channel access due to its temporal-based MAC layer resource allocation (MAC-RA). WLAN uses a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) procedure to access the channel resources, which is based on a binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism. In BEB, a random backoff value is generated from a contention window (CW) to obtain channel access. The CW size is doubled after every unsuccessful transmission and reset to its minimum value on successfully transmissions. However, this blindness when increasing and resetting the CW induces performance degradation. For a dense network, resetting the CW to its minimum size may result in more collisions and poor network performance. Likewise, for a small network environment, a blind increase in CW size may cause an unnecessarily long delay while accessing the channel. To satisfy the diverse requirements of dense WLANs, it is anticipated that prospective HEW will autonomously access the best channel resources with the assistance of sophisticated wireless channel condition inference in order to control channel collisions. Such intelligence is possible with the introduction of deep learning (DL) techniques in future WLANs. The potential applications of DL to the MAC layer of IEEE 802.11 standards have already been progressively acknowledged due to their novel features for future communications. Their new features challenge conventional communications theories with more sophisticated artificial intelligence-based theories. DL has been extensively proposed for the MAC layer of WLANs in various research areas, such as deployment of cognitive radio and communications networks. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the DL techniques that are motivated by the behaviorist sensibility and control philosophy, where a learner can achieve an objective by interacting with the environment. In this chapter, a DRL-based intelligent paradigm is developed for channel access in dense WLANs in smart cities. One of the DRL models, Q-learning (QL), is used to propose an intelligent QL-based resource allocation ( i QRA) mechanism for MAC-RA in dense wireless networks. i QRA exploits channel observation-based collision probability for network inference to dynamically and autonomously control the backoff parameters (such as backoff stages and CW values). The simulations performed in network simulator 3 (ns3) indicate that the proposed DRL-based i QRA paradigm learns diverse WLAN environments and optimizes its performance, compared to conventional non-intelligent MAC protocol, BEB. The performance of the proposed i QRA mechanism is evaluated in diverse WLAN network environments with throughput, channel access delay, and fairness as performance metrics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14718-1_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Consequently, cloud data centers become hungry for energy consumption. This has an adverse effect on the environment in addition to the high operational and maintenance costs of large-scale data centers. Several works in the literature have proposed energy-efficient task scheduling in a cloud computing environment. However, most of these works use a scheduler that predicts the power consumption of an incoming task based on a static model. In most scenarios, the scheduler considers the CPU utilization of a server for power prediction and task allocations. This might give misleading results as the power consumption of a server, handling a variety of requests in smart cities, depends on other metrics such as memory, disk, and network in addition to CPU. Our proposed Intelligent Autonomous Agent Energy-Aware Task Scheduler in Virtual Machines (IAA-EATSVM) uses the multi-metric machine learning approach for scheduling of incoming tasks.

We refer to this challenge as the Problem of Crowd Information Quality (Crowd IQ). We need to increase quality while giving contributors the flexibility to contribute data based on their individual perceptions. The design science research project produced several artifacts, including a citizen science information system (NLNature), design principles (guidelines) for the development of crowdsourcing projects, and an instance-based crowdsourcing design theory. We also made several methodological contributions related to the process of design science research and behavioral research in information systems. Over the course of the project, we addressed several challenges in designing crowdsourcing systems, formulating design principles, and conducting rigorous design science research. Specifically, we showed that: design choices can have a sizable impact in the real world; it can be unclear how to implement design principles; and design features that are unrelated to design principles can confound efforts to evaluate artifacts.

Big data cannot be processed by traditional tools and technologies due to their properties, volume, velocity, veracity, and variety.

Especially Enterprise IoT projects have more challenges due to the involvement of multi-disciplinary challenges. This chapter tries to address the important concerns in initiating the implementation activity of an Enterprise IoT project. This chapter does not address the technicalities of implementation or the design procedure, but the higher level requirements for commencing the implementation. The use case development and technology choices for hardware and software are discussed in detail. There are several vendors who are manufacturing hardware devices for the Enterprise IoT solutions. They support various protocols and behave differently when it comes to data collection and management. Similarly, the software stack also very fragmented in nature. From the edge computing to cloud computing there are several options which are to be analyzed and chosen carefully. The implementation scope goes beyond simple data collection and basic processing. The technology landscape is dominated by few emerging trends which are changing the Enterprise works. The last part of this chapter discusses three major technology breakthroughs which needs to be considered while implementation is done. Big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence are gaining momentum in the development world nowadays. The algorithms and other basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence or machine learning were developed long ago. However only now we are able to get the large amount of data due to Enterprise IoT to experience the benefits of those algorithms. The Block chain technology is another game changer in the data management space. It has huge promises for security, immutability and other characteristics of data which have been desired for long.

Recently, there have been malware attacks on IoT devices, the most prominent one being that of Mirai. IoT devices such as IP cameras, DVRs and routers were compromised by the Mirai malware and later large-scale DDoS attacks were propagated using those infected devices (bots) in October 2016. In this research, we develop a network-based algorithm which can be used to detect IoT bots infected by Mirai or similar malware in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP network). The algorithm particularly targets bots scanning the network for vulnerable devices since the typical scanning phase for botnets lasts for months and the bots can be detected much before they are involved in an actual attack. We analyze the unique signatures of the Mirai malware to identify its presence in an IoT device. Further, to optimize the usage of computational resources, we use a two-dimensional (2D) packet sampling approach, wherein we sample the packets transmitted by IoT devices both across time and across the devices. Leveraging the Mirai signatures identified and the 2D packet sampling approach, a bot detection algorithm is proposed. We use testbed measurements and simulations to study the relationship between bot detection delays and the sampling frequencies for device packets. Subsequently, we derive insights from the obtained results and use them to design our proposed bot detection algorithm. Finally, we discuss the deployment of our bot detection algorithm and the countermeasures which can be taken post detection.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12385-7_58,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, we have witnessed a total paradigm shift in computing techniques. The world is steadily moving towards the realization of Nanotechnology wherein the computing devices are getting miniaturized yet providing powerful computing capabilities. IoT is finding its ways in almost every sphere of computing and related services. A typical Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem consists of thousands of miniature chips, devices and objects forming systems and subsystems which generates huge amount of data and information. The data from these devices interacts with each other to provide services to the users. However, these interactions sometimes may lead to unintended data leakages and security breaches thus compromising the security and privacy of the stakeholders. The most pertinent factor which comes as a hindrance is the varied nature of the data captured and processed by IoT devices. Since individual IoT devices are largely of different make, model and manufacturer, they capture and process data in their respective formats. Therefore it is essential to devise mechanisms, tools and techniques for standardizing the data captured from different IoT devices. The security of the data and the privacy of the users and devices are the other two important factors which must be addressed in order to develop an effective and efficient IoT ecosystem.

The continuously generated data in such systems form both a challenge but also a possibility: data volumes/rates are high and require processing and communication capacity but they contain information useful for system operation and for detection of unwanted situations. In this chapter we explain that stream processing (a.k.a. data streaming) is an emerging useful approach both for general applications and for intrusion detection in particular, especially since it can enable data analysis to be carried out in the continuum of edge-fog-cloud distributed architectures of industrial networks, thus reducing communication latency and gradually filtering and aggregating data volumes. We argue that usefulness stems also due to facilitating provisioning of agile responses, i.e. due to potentially smaller latency for intrusion detection and hence also improved possibilities for intrusion mitigation. In the chapter we outline architectural features of IIoT networks, potential threats and examples of state-of-the art intrusion detection methodologies. Moreover, we give an overview of how leveraging distributed and parallel execution of streaming applications in industrial setups can influence the possibilities of protecting these systems. In these contexts, we give examples using electricity networks (a.k.a. Smart Grid systems).

With the enlargement of WSNs, great advances have been shaped in Internet-of-Things (IoT) by an ample variety of applications. IoT applications practiced in myriad phases include human life, ecological supervise, public wellbeing and medical behavior, smart shipping, traffic monitoring, smart cities, smart home applications, smart grid, and others. Mostly Internet of Things maintained with various sensing devices and technologies such as Sensors, GPS (Global positioning system), laser sensor, gas inductor, RFID (Radio-frequency identification devices), infrared sensor and many more, which collects large range features from the real world and send abstract feature objects which need to be monitored. Most of the devices are linked and interacted with more than one. The main idea behind IoT is to connect device-to-device, device-to-human, human-to-human. Development of IoT can make people live in a convenient way; however, it does not make sure the security of secret confidential information of its user. With a great collection of distribution, responsiveness and somewhat high processing capacity of IoT objects formed them as an optimal objective for cyber-attacks. So here some probabilities, secret confidential information may be a leak or stolen some point in time. Just once a sign of IoT device is captured or suspended it intention straightforwardly perturbs the security about whole information of IoT. Moreover, enormous IoT nodes accumulate a large amount of extensive prosperous, private information and process it, so its like lottery for cyber attackers to steal entire important data. Security obstacles like privacy, secure communication, access control, safe storage of data are becoming important tackles in the IoT domain.

When making decisions using data, it is critical to use the most appropriate data. When creating predictive analytics, the selection of data sources is important as the quality of the sources influences the accuracy of the predictive model. Within a smart environment, a dataspace is valuable for data scientists as it provides a one-stop shop of all the data required for creating their analytical models: enterprise data, Internet of Things (IoT), sensor data, and open data. However, the increase in the number of data sources presents a challenge in selecting the most appropriate data source to use. The co-existence approach of dataspaces results in them containing much more data sources than within traditional data management approaches. This means that the need to perform source selection is an ongoing activity; as the dataspace is incrementally improved, sources will need to be re-examined to determine their suitability for tasks.

It is critical for MCS to identify right persons for a given sensing task. A commonly-used strategy is to “teach-before-use”, i.e., training users with a set of questions and selecting a subset of users who have answered the questions correctly the most of times. This method has large room for improvement if we consider users’ learning curve during the training process. As such, we propose an interactive learning pattern recognition framework, Goldilocks, that can filter users based on their learning patterns. Goldilocks uses an adaptive teaching method tailored for each user to maximize her learning performance. At the same time, the teaching process is also the selecting process. A user can thus be safely excluded as early as possible from the MCS tasks later on if her performance still does not match the desired learning pattern after the training period. Experiments on real-world datasets show that compared to the baseline methods, Goldilocks can identify suitable users to obtain more accurate and more stable results for multi-categories classification problems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38819-5_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The main aim of these IoT networks is to infer some meaningful information from the collected data. For the same, the huge data is transmitted to cloud which is highly expensive and time consuming. This huge cost is significantly reduced with introduction of Fog Computing (FC) which suggests performing data processing closer to its generation site. FC suggests preprocessing enormous data ahead of forwarding it to cloud by introducing a virtual layer between IoT and cloud, viz., Fog layer and thus accomplishes several benefits like reduced latency, low communication cost, reliability, and scalability. These benefits strongly advocate its employment in real-time application. However, FC also bears some challenges despite several benefits. First and foremost, the processing capability and storage at fog layer is limited in contrast to cloud. Hence, rigorous research is taking place in the direction of devising effective and efficient framework to garner utmost advantage of introducing fog layer. Here, in this chapter, we propose a framework that aims to improve QoS (Quality-of-Service) by providing reduced latency and load balancing at fog layer. This improvement in QoS is achieved with help of data aggregation and load balancing. In the proposed framework, an overburdened fog node requests its neighboring node to share its load. Additionally, it suggests implementing various techniques to aggregate data ahead of transmission.

We can apply the knowledge of machine learning to deal with some problems in our daily life. Taxi service provides a convenient way of transportation, especially for those who travel to an unfamiliar place. But there can be a risk that the passenger gets overcharged on the unnecessary mileages. To help the passenger to determine whether the taxi driver has made a detour, we propose a solution which is a cloud-based system and applies machine learning algorithms to detect anomaly taxi trajectory for the passenger.

Training a high-quality SVM classifier usually requires a huge amount of data, which makes collaborative training by multiple parties become an inevitable trend. However, it causes privacy risks when sharing sensitive data with others. There are some existing methods to solve this problem. These methods mainly contain computation-intensive cryptographic techniques which are inefficient and not suitable for practical use. Therefore, it is important to realize efficient SVM classifier training while protecting privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving SVM classifier training scheme based on blockchain. We establish a blockchain-based SVM classifier training mechanism which realizes collaboratively training while protecting privacy. We adopt the additive secret sharing technique to design several computation protocols, which are much more efficient than the schemes which contain complex cryptographic primitives.

(Evolutionary computation, optimization and learning algorithms for data science. arXiv preprint, arXiv: 1908.08006, 2019), we have explored the theoretical aspects of feature selection and evolutionary algorithms. In this chapter, we focus on optimization algorithms for enhancing data analytic process, i.e., we propose to explore applications of nature-inspired algorithms in data science. Feature selection optimization is a hybrid approach leveraging feature selection techniques and evolutionary algorithms process to optimize the selected features. Prior works solve this problem iteratively to converge to an optimal feature subset. Feature selection optimization is a non-specific domain approach. Data scientists mainly attempt to find an advanced way to analyse data n with high computational efficiency and low time complexity, leading to efficient data analytics. Thus, by increasing generated/measured/sensed data from various sources, analysis, manipulation and illustration of data grow exponentially. Due to the large scale datasets, curse of dimensionality (CoD) is one of the NP-hard problems in data science. Hence, several efforts have been focused on leveraging evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to address the complex issues in large scale data analytics problems. Dimension reduction, together with EAs, lends itself to solve CoD and solve complex problems, in terms of time complexity, efficiently. In this chapter, we first provide a brief overview of previous studies that focused on solving CoD using feature extraction optimization process.

Drive-by sensing is a form of crowdsensing wherein sensor-equipped vehicles (aka, mobile agents) are the primary data gathering agents. Enhancing the efficacy of drive-by sensing poses many challenges, an important one of which is to select non-dedicated mobile agents on which a limited number of sensors are to be mounted. This problem, which we refer to as the mobile-agent selection problem, has a significant impact on the spatio-temporal coverage of the drive-by sensing platforms and the resultant datasets. The challenge here is to achieve maximum spatiotemporal coverage while taking the relative importance levels of geographical areas into account.

Our work makes several significant technical contributions. First, we delineate a model for representing the mobile agent selection problem. This model takes into account the trajectories of the vehicles (public transportation buses in our case) and the relative importance of the urban regions, and formulates it as an optimization problem. Second, we provide an algorithm based on the utility (coverage) values of mobile agents, namely, a hotspot-based algorithm that limits the search space to important sub-regions. Third, we design a highly efficient coverage redundancy minimization algorithm that, at each step, chooses the mobile agent, which provides maximal improvement to the spatio-temporal coverage.

By contrast, this paper suggests learning separate subspaces for features and labels by maximizing the independence between the components in each subspace, as well as maximizing the correlation between these two subspaces. The learned independent label components indicate the fundamental combinations of labels in multi-label datasets, which thus helps to reveal the correlation between labels. Furthermore, the learned independent feature components lead to a compact representation of example features. The connections between the proposed algorithm and existing embedding methods are discussed in detail. Experimental results on real-world multi-label datasets demonstrate that it is necessary for us to explore independent components from multi-label data, and further prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10707-019-00383-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In lockstep with technological development, this study identified three time periods of development. For each period, we investigate cases that best represent e-business model development. Employing Wirtz’s four business-to-consumer business model subtypes, we found that the commerce-type model (focus on trade transactions) dominated online travel agencies until 2000, while the next period was characterized by the advent of Web 2.0-enabled content-type models (providing online content, specifically user-generated content) and context-type models (aggregation of already existing online content) for information search portals. Finally, the increased complexity of the Internet in the last decade is also captured in multiple online business models, including the connection-type model (establishing real or virtual connections) pursued by platform businesses. The chapter offers avenues for future research that relate to theoretical issues across the three identified periods and an outlook of future tourism business model developments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05324-6_71-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To cope the small amount of diversity problem for IOT devices and applications, two research trends are investigated for the system design of edge nodes: heterogeneity and virtualization. In this paper, we consider the integration of those two important trends and present a virtualization system for embedded GPU architectures, called qCUDA-ARM. The design of qCUDA-ARM is based on the framework of qCUDA, a virtualization system for x86 servers. Because of the architectural differences between x86 servers and ARM based embedded systems, many subsystems of qCUDA-ARM, such as memory management, need to be redesigned. We evaluated the performance of qCUDA-ARM with three CUDA benchmarks and two real world applications. For computational intensive jobs, qCUDA-ARM can reach similar performance of the native system; and for memory bound programs, qCUDA-ARM can also have up to 90% performance of that of the native one.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38651-1_23,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

From low-power sensors to multi-core platforms, IoT devices are prone to failures due to the reliability degradation of electronic circuits, batteries, and other components. As the network of heterogeneous devices expands, maintenance costs due to system failures become unmanageable, making reliability a major concern. Prior work has shown the importance of automated reliability management for meeting lifetime goals for individual devices. However, state-of-the-art network simulators do not provide reliability modeling capabilities for IoT networks. In this paper, we present an integrated reliability framework for IoT networks based on the ns-3 simulator. The lack of such tools restrained researchers from doing reliability-oriented analysis, exploration, and predictions early in the design cycle. Our contribution facilitates this, which can lead to the design of new network reliability management strategies. The proposed framework, besides reliability, incorporates three other interrelated models - power, performance, and temperature - which are required to model reliability. We validate our framework on a mesh network with ten heterogeneous devices, of three different types. We demonstrate that the models accurately capture the power, temperature, and reliability dynamics of real networks. We finally simulate and analyze two examples of energy-optimized and reliability-optimized network configurations to show how the framework offers an opportunity for researchers to explore trade-offs between energy and reliability in IoT networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59615-6_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While platform services and companies are increasingly recognised as extractive in their programmatic approach to market steering, nevertheless there remain diverse forms of value-sharing and networked sociality active within platform ecosystems. They are not simply sites of sub-ordination. This challenges the way platform influence or control is seen to operate in relation to its users, and in turn the way platform power is conceived. Drawing on insights from social media scholars, the notion of ‘proprietary opacity’ is can be understood as a form of platform governance that is recombinatory in nature—at once activating diverse forms of value-sharing and participation within platform ecosystems, while data harvesting and algorithmic programming remain highly centralised. The recombinatory nature of platform governance provides an important framework through which to understand the nature of contemporary platform influence, beyond the logics of control and subordination. While the increasingly distributed nature of platform technologies represents fresh challenges for urban governance, this chapter also situates contemporary platform architectures as being historically consistent with the development commercial software services. Contemporary platform imaginaries and challenges return us to previous generations of cybernetic thought about control, entropy, information asymmetries and governance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-32-9725-8_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The Blockchain’s potential to overcome different challenges of IoT services has shifted the research interests of many scientists towards addressing the integration of two disruptive technologies, i.e., IoT and Blockchain. This resulted in publishing more research papers in this emerging field. Thus, there is a need to conduct research studies through which a broad overview of research contributions in this field could be investigated. To respond to this need, a number of review papers have been published recently, each of which has considered the integration of IoT and Blockchain from a different perspective. Nonetheless, none of them has reported a bibliometric analysis of the state-of-the-art in the integration of IoT and Blockchain.

In the present day, technology is widely feared as a threat to democracy and progress. Social media spreads fake news, AI offers technocratic rather than deliberative solutions to society’s ills. In this respect there is a pronounced, political technophobia. The rise of AI has additionally spurred new political visions of technological emancipation spanning the ideological spectrum from libertarianism to socialism. Yet both its detractors and proponents miss the full radical political potential of a transhuman politics. It is one where non-humans and human citizens deploy the latest virtual, digital and manufacturing advances to mutually design their societies. This chapter introduces a transhuman politics of mutual intelligent design. It builds, in this spirit, on emerging notions of “transhuman democracy” and “cyborg citizens” promoting the importance of social democracy to ensure that technology benefits the many not just the few. Moving beyond these valuable but limiting conceptions, we will then explore the exciting role of technologies like simulations and big data for enlivening and improving contemporary political democracies and social movements. This will be set against more critical concerns about the potential role of technology for leading to further exclusion, inequality and disenfranchisement. This will lead to a broader discussion of the ways in the future virtual worlds could exist as new public spaces for debate and social experimentation. Moreover, it will investigate the potentialities of creating an “open source democracy” where humans and non-humans make shared decisions of how to best design their environments for the public good.

An IoT Development Model is used to design, represent, and analyze the system through a set of submodels. The main challenges that the proposed system addresses include supporting accurate physiological parameter measurements, remote sensing, and correct detection. This chapter includes studying challenges, such as accurately using the device and the training needed by the users—as related to the adoption of such a modern tool by the target human subjects. The proposed system is supported by two mobile monitoring devices at the child and parent, or caregiver, sides, sensors, wireless communication nodes, control processors, Internet access, and a supporting server. ChildPOPS enables a ubiquitous access using tablets and smartphones through a mobile application or a web browser. This chapter includes studying the effectiveness of adding smart bands, at the child and parents’ sides, to enable accurate monitoring. In addition, the system supports the interaction with a software system that provides assisted communication and intervention when needed. System testing includes multiple detection scenarios and the reliability of interactions. System testing, analysis, and evaluation confirms ChildPOPS effectiveness in application.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-39986-3_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recent advances in information and communication technologies enable collection of real-time information from various sources. For example, sensors deployed in the fields collect data about the environment. Similarly, social networks like Twitter and Facebook can help to collect data from people in the disaster zone. On one hand, inadequate situation awareness in disasters has been identified as one of the primary factors in human errors with grave consequences such as loss of lives and destruction of critical infrastructure. On the other hand, the growing ubiquity of social media and mobile devices, and pervasive nature of the Internet-of-Things means that there are more sources of outbound traffic, which ultimately results in the creation of a data deluge, beginning shortly after the onset of disaster events, leading to the problem of information tsunami. In addition, security and privacy has crucial role to overcome the misuse of the system for either intrusions into data or overcome the misuse of the information that was meant for a specified purpose. These problems can be addressed by processing the collected data in real-time and extracting meaningful and actionable information for emergency providers while taking care of security and privacy aspects. Such situation-awareness applications demand a large amount of computing resources. The cloud, which provides elastic and scalable infrastructure, becomes the natural choice for such applications. In this chapter, we provide such a situation aware application to support disaster management data lifecycle, i.e. from data ingestion and processing to alert dissemination. We utilize cloud computing, Internet of Things and social computing technologies to achieve a scalable, efficient, and usable situation-aware application called Cloud4BigData.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43795-4_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Multimedia data includes audio, video, images associated with applications like similarity searches, entity resolution, and classification. Visual data mining is now one of the active learning fields that include surveillance applications for object detection, fraud detection, crime detection, and other applications. Multimedia data mining includes many challenges like data volume, variety, and unstructured nature, nonstationary, and real time. It needs advanced processing capabilities to make decisions in near real time. The existing traditional database systems, data mining techniques cannot be used because of its limitations. Hence, to process such large amounts of data advanced techniques like machine learning, deep learning methods can be used. Multimedia data also includes sensor data that is widely generated. Most of the healthcare applications include sensors for detecting heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse rate. The advancement of the smartphones has resulted in fitness based applications based on the number of steps walked, calories count, kilometers ran, etc. All these types of data can be classified as Multimedia data for Internet of Things (IoT). There are many interfacing devices that are interconnected to each other with backbone as a computer network when sensor data is involved. The main aim of this chapter is to highlight the importance and convergence of deep learning techniques with IoT. Emphasis is laid on classification of IoT data using deep learning and the essential fine-tuning of parameters. A virtual sensor device implemented in python is used for simulation.

Geospatial functions cut across many fields and support problem solving through geodata design and analysis. GIS have been used, for example, in environmental conservation and wildlife management. Its use in tourism planning, development and management, and marketing of destination products is only a more recent approach. The adoption of the technology affects both the sustainability of environmental resources and the quality of tourists’ experience. The purpose of this chapter is, first, to explore the functionalities and usage potentials of GIS in the tourism domain. Second, two studies of Maasai Mara Game Reserve and Nairobi National Park portray how GIS and satellite remote sensing imagery is applied to assess the ecosystem’s changes, their causes, and major implications. Examination of Landsat satellite image data for 2000 and 2017 shows that due to conversion of areas to farmlands and settlements, the coverage of Mau Forest Complex, the main catchment area for the Mara ecosystem, had reduced by 30.2% and vegetation by 22.8%. The analysis of Nairobi National Park showed that the Kitengela wildlife migration corridor has been completely encroached by human settlement and mining activities, thus seriously compromising the performance of the ecosystem.

On the one hand, systems dealing with strict-timing constraints in safety-critical applications mainly focused on predictability, leaving little room for complex planning and decision-making processes. Indeed, real-time techniques are very efficient in predetermined, constrained, and controlled scenarios. Nevertheless, they lack the necessary flexibility to operate in evolving settings, where the software needs to adapt to the changes of the environment. On the other hand, Intelligent Systems (IS) increasingly adopted Machine Learning (ML) techniques (e.g., subsymbolic predictors such as Neural Networks). The seminal application of those IS started in zero-risk domains producing revolutionary results. However, the ever-increasing exploitation of ML-based approaches generated opaque systems, which are nowadays no longer socially acceptable—calling for eXplainable AI (XAI). Such a problem is exacerbated when IS tend to approach safety-critical scenarios. This paper highlights the need for on-time explainability.

We everyday hear about Amazon echo, Google Mini, Smart watches etc. These devices collect confidential data of a person and as most of these systems follow centralized architecture approach, So most of the data on internet is basically managed by some central authority or organization. Though these organizations have strict policy regarding data misuse or changing of data without consent but one can’t overlook the fact that these organizations have the ability to do so. Blockchain helps solve such problem as it is not managed by single party if somebody tries to change data in his Blockchain then the hash of the particular block will no longer match and the particular Blockchain will become invalid and other Blockchain will still be intact and therefore users data won’t be compromised. But due to high resource requirement, it becomes problem to run complete Blockchain node on all IoT devices mainly on low power or memory devices. In this paper, we have developed decentralized architecture leveraged from Blockchain technology coupled with an alternative centralized cloud architecture which is a classic client/server architecture with an underlying Blockchain at back-end support with smart contract application written in Solidity language at Ethereum platform. We implement this framework and show how this architecture prevent data misuse by using functionality of Blockchain without requiring the all IoT devices to actually run a Blockchain node. For an end-user experience, it will appear to be same as a normal web app and from the developers perspective, the smart contract application will have similar software design to current web apps thus allowing an easy transition for both of centralized and decentralized methods while still retaining the trust of decentralization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45989-5_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, IT is growing in importance in the share of energy consumption in the world. As a reaction to this negative effect, the so-called Green IT movement emerged. This field of study is aimed to reduce IT-related energy consumption and overall IT environmental impact including a variety of aspects like power consumption, lower carbon emissions and their environmental impact. One of the leading technologies in the IT arena is Reality technologies including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). These technologies have impacted sectors like Real Estate, Education, Healthcare, Marketing, Travel and Manufacturing, citing just some of the most relevant application areas. Taking into account the importance of these technologies and the expected impact in the future, authors conducted a systematic literature review devoted to investigate their “greenability”. Authors are aware of the importance of the topic and aim to identify, evaluate, and synthesize research published concerning aspects like energy consumption and eco-effectiveness of main reality technologies.

Despite the increasing accuracy achieved so far, it still remains under-explored how the decisions made by such systems may be influenced by the inherent characteristics of the individual under consideration. In this paper, we investigate how state-of-the-art speaker verification models are susceptible to unfairness towards legally-protected classes of individuals, characterized by a common sensitive attribute (i.e., gender, age, language). To this end, we first arranged a voice dataset, with the aim of including and identifying various demographic classes. Then, we conducted a performance analysis at different levels, from equal error rates to verification score distributions. Experiments show that individuals belonging to certain demographic groups systematically experience higher error rates, highlighting the need of fairer speaker recognition models and, by extension, of proper evaluation frameworks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58811-3_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The traditional PTS is in high demand in urban cities and heavily contributes to air pollution, traffic accidents, road congestion, increase of green house gases like oxides of carbon (OC), methane $${({\text {CH}}_4)}$$ , and oxides of nitrogen $${{\text {(NO}}_x)}$$ emissions. PTS also suffers from the limitations of preset routes, privacy, crowd, and less space for passengers. Some PTS are densely crowded in few routes, whereas in other routes they are not crowded at all. Thus, the aforementioned limitations of toxic emissions coupled with load management and balancing in PTS are a critical issue. The paper proposes IIGPTS : IoT-based framework for Intelligent Green Public Transportation System that addresses the mentioned issues by measuring emission sensor readings with respect to varying parameters like passenger density (total carrying load), fuel consumption, and routing paths. The performance of IIGPTS is analyzed at an indicated time slot to measure emissions and load on the system. Then, the simulation is performed based on dynamic routes by increasing passenger load and measuring the service time for user traffic as requests, also considering the request drops. The results obtained by IIGPTS framework indicate a delay of 104 s for 10,000 requests spread across an entire day, which is negligible considering the load. Thus, IIGPTS can intelligently handle varying capacity loads at varying routes, with fewer emissions, making the realization of green eco-friendly PTS systems a reality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3369-3_14,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To define an intelligence to a connected object, one can use a Believe Desire Intention agent (BDI an intelligent agent that adopts human behavior) such as Jason Agentspeak. But Jason AgentSpeak does not guarantee orchestration or choreography between connected objects. There are platforms for service orchestration and choreography in IoT, still the interconnection with artificial intelligence needs to be built.

The architecture that we propose allows to create the link between Artificial Intelligence and Services choreography to reduce human intervention in the service choreography. In order to validate the proposed approach, we have interconnected the Iot BeC 3 platform and the REST agent (Jason-RS). The decision-making faculty offered by Jason-RS is derived from the information sent by the objects according to the different methods of REST (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) that Jason-RS offers.

Critical infrastructure security is a major area of concern for all governments. In the United States, several laboratories such as Sandia National Lab, Idaho National Lab, and National Institutes of Standards have built critical infrastructure cyber-security experimentation test-beds. These test-beds are built with industry-scale equipment from various sectors of critical infrastructures to allow researchers to detect vulnerabilities in multitude of products that are used by utility companies in their systems and to research efficacy of their remediation techniques. These test-beds also allow utilities to bring in hardware and software products for hardware/software-in-the-loop testing for vulnerability detection or cyber-security product validation. In India, there has been no such test-bed for such research and validation activities. In the interdisciplinary center for cyber-security and cyber defense of critical infrastructures (C3i) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, we are building such a facility—a first in India.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using unsupervised domain adaptation to address this scalability issue. Existing methods typically conduct adaptation on the representation space that contains both id-related and id-unrelated factors, thus inevitably undermining the adaptation efficacy of id-related features. In this paper, we seek to improve adaptation by purifying the representation space to be adapted. To this end, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles id-related/unrelated features and enforces adaptation to work on the id-related feature space exclusively. Our model involves a disentangling module that encodes cross-domain images into a shared appearance space and two separate structure spaces, and an adaptation module that performs adversarial alignment and self-training on the shared appearance space. The two modules are co-designed to be mutually beneficial.

However, recent studies have revealed that deep object detectors can be compromised under adversarial attacks, causing a victim detector to detect no object, fake objects, or mislabeled objects. With object detection being used pervasively in many security-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities, we argue that a holistic approach for an in-depth understanding of adversarial attacks and vulnerabilities of deep object detection systems is of utmost importance for the research community to develop robust defense mechanisms. This paper presents a framework for analyzing and evaluating vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art object detectors under an adversarial lens, aiming to analyze and demystify the attack strategies, adverse effects, and costs, as well as the cross-model and cross-resolution transferability of attacks. Using a set of quantitative metrics, extensive experiments are performed on six representative deep object detectors from three popular families (YOLOv3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) with two benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO). We demonstrate that the proposed framework can serve as a methodical benchmark for analyzing adversarial behaviors and risks in real-time object detection systems.

The methodology is developed for the needs of the RESIIST research project. We start from the observation that the security of large cities has become a major issue. To ensure the proper functioning of critical infrastructures, it is essential to make the right decisions at the right time. To do this, managers are informed in their decision-making processes by several indicators such as resilience. As insecurity becomes more and more threatening with technological, natural and terrorist risks, it is essential to have an indicator of resilience of the infrastructures guaranteeing security. We therefore propose an innovative method of assessing resilience. It is innovative in that it combines both the genericity (it applies to all types of infrastructure), it takes into account several dimensions (economic, technical, social, human, regulatory etc.), it integrates massive data (from cameras, sensors, GIS, and social networks), it allows decision-making in an immersive environment in virtual reality.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42517-3_20,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Hence, the opportunistic security game (OSG) model is proposed and applied in crime diffusion in recent years. However, previous OSG models do not consider that a criminal can cooperate with other criminals and this situation is very common in real life. Criminals can agree to attack the selected multiple targets simultaneously and share the utility. The police may be unable to decide which target to protect because multiple targets are attacked at the same time, so criminals can gain more utility through cooperation and interfere with police decisions. To overcome this limitation of previous OSG model, this paper makes the following contributions. Firstly, we propose a new security game framework COSG (Cooperative Opportunistic Security Game) which can capture bounded rationality of the adversaries in the cooperative opportunistic crime.

Discerning three key functions of e-participation—monitoring, agenda-setting and input to decision-making—the authors review a variety of formally institutionalised mechanisms as well as informal expressions of civic engagement, including social media. The examination of digital tool use for monitoring purposes extends from electronic information access and exchange to e-deliberation, while the role for agenda-setting mainly includes uses for e-petitions and e-campaigning, showing a mixed picture of democratic impacts. The review of e-participation providing input for decision-making focusses on e-consultations, e-participative budgeting and e-voting, identifying several persisting problems with the latter instrument. A special section examines e-participation at EU-level, from deliberative citizens’ involvement projects and e-consultation to the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) and e-petitions to the European Parliament. Findings show that digital tools enhance direct and participative democracy in many respects; however, exaggerated expectations of new democratic potentials remain unfulfilled: deliberative participative designs lack any impact on decision-making, and the ECI still is rather an instrument for civil society mobilisation than citizen empowerment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-27184-8_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Personal healthcare device such as ECG senses very sensitive voltage from heart and stream the data in high speed to the IoT platform. Data from ECG can be used for many disease diagnoses, including Arrhythmia and sleep disorder. In order to obtain the optimum diagnosis result, IoT platform for healthcare should be able to handle very rapid data stream from users or devices simultaneously and keep the successful connections at a high rate. In this paper, an IoT architecture for healthcare implementing asynchronous processing is proposed. Asynchronous process allows the system to process the data outside the main loop of process. The proposed system measures HTTP successful connections and analytics accuracy. By implementing asynchronous processing, the system can increase the successful HTTP connection up to 50% for 100 users testing scenario compared to the benchmark system.

Such observations are often queried to optimize the health of the infrastructure. Recently, edge storage systems allow us to retain data on the edge rather than moving them centrally to the cloud. However, such systems do not support flexible querying over the data spread across 10–100’s of devices. There is also a lack of distributed time-series databases that can run on the edge devices. Here, we propose TorqueDB , a distributed query engine over time-series data that operates on edge and fog resources. TorqueDB leverages our prior work on ElfStore, a distributed edge-local file store, and InfluxDB, a time-series database, to enable temporal queries to be decomposed and executed across multiple fog and edge devices. Interestingly, we move data into InfluxDB on-demand while retaining the durable data within ElfStore for use by other applications. We also design a cost model that maximizes parallel movement and execution of the queries across resources, and utilizes caching. Our experiments on a real edge, fog and cloud deployment show that TorqueDB performs comparable to InfluxDB on a cloud VM for a smart city query workload, but without the associated monetary costs.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57675-2_18,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Chapter,doi:10.1007/978-3-030-22070-9_6,"AI, IoT, Big Data, and Technologies in Digital Economy with Blockchain at Sustainable Work Satisfaction to Smart Mankind: Access to 6th Dimension of Human Rights",Smart Governance for Cities: Perspectives and Experiences,10.1007/978-3-030-22070-9_6,Springer,2020-01-01,"The usefulness of this work lies in the need for the world economy to circulate product, service, and wealth in a safe and profitable way. The survival of mankind depends on this. Taxation to smart economy has been the cause of many discussions since 2015. Taxation should provide resources for governments to move the economy and ensure a dignity life for the citizen. It cannot be a cause of economic stagnation like it has been happening in many countries. Thus, this work is a complete legal doctrine that serves as guideline for rulers, attorneys, lawyers, judges, companies, and anyone who is involved in the digital economy. The international scenario calls for laws to ensure security, trust, and an inclusive standard for international taxation. Until January 2019, only a few countries have been doing their regulatory framework but there is still no inclusive standard and for this reason the scenario is chaotic and many companies find it difficult to move in full compliance. The digital economy must be analyzed within the POSITIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. This is the set of laws that govern the life of the citizen in the public and private field, within his/her country or in the international field. Thus, it will not be correct to analyze and discuss the digital economy only in the internal field of a country or consider only commercial conduct because this is part of the life of the citizen and affects all humanity in all fields: social, economic, criminal, civil, tributary, and humanitarian. It isn’t correct to analyze the digital economy only on a bias. The angle should be 360° because the smart economy makes part of the world. For these reasons, this legal doctrine is complete and provides a useful guideline for guiding conducts in the gray areas in smart economy. In the field of law science, commercial or civilian conduct only has three possible commands: ALLOWED, COMPULSORY, AND PROHIBITED. There is no fourth alternative. So, everything that isn’t forbidden will consequently be allowed. The PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY doesn’t authorize criminalization of conduct that hasn’t been described in law like a crime and there is the possibility that companies may claim the postponement of the effects of the new rules based on the PRINCIPLE OF ANTERIORITY. Therefore, knowing the actions prohibited or against compliance, automatically, establishes the conduct that is allowed because they aren’t prohibited. This is important at this time where the digital economy doesn’t have a general and transparent international rule. Establishing technologies like AI, IoT, big data, and smart economy with blockchain and cryptocurrencies as the 6TH DIMENSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS guides governments’ annual budget plans to maximize the application of taxes rather than just creating new forms of taxation that imposes weight unbearable for business and threatens the survival of mankind, and the democratic principles allow it to be brought in a participative way. This legal doctrine results in peace to business and mankind, safe borders, and human security. It means a SUSTAINABLE WORLD and a SUSTAINABLE WORK SATISFACTION.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22070-9_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Things are required to have communication abilities through a wired or wireless communication network such as the Internet to interact with each other to share the information. Communication capability is the key element in turning a smart system into a smart connected system. A smart connected system can enhance the interactions between the units as well as between human and devices. This chapter defines different layers of an IoT network starting from device layers to business decisions. It introduces the components of the system including sensors, actuators, etc. and defines the most important roles of each component. Relationship between the components of an IoT network would be discussed in this chapter. Devices are also different in their qualities and the amount of noise or variance in measurements. Therefore, sensor selection is a critical step in making a successful smart connected system. Currently available technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing, etc. enable these components to communicate and transfer data within acceptable time and cost. However, raw data do not reveal helpful information about the status of a system. Analytics should be performed to reveal the information, patterns, abnormalities, etc. Key performance indicators (KPIs), such as efficiency and availability, are useful to extract beneficial information. Although information at component or machine level can be applied to make low-level decisions, IoT capabilities can be further promoted by analyzing this information to develop knowledge and finally wisdom about the system using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) principles. The concept of IoT is not only limited within a company and the decisions made by that organization, but IoT also governs every step of the value chain starting from suppliers, production, services, and warranty.

Starting without the burden of legacy code, a holistic performance engineering process could be deployed across the traditional software layers to identify efficient implementations and guide sustainable software development. At the basic building blocks level, a flexible MPI+X programming approach was implemented together with a new sparse data structure (SELL- C - σ ) to support heterogeneous architectures by design. Furthermore, ESSEX focused on hardware-efficient kernels for all relevant architectures and efficient data structures for block vector formulations of the eigensolvers. The algorithm layer addressed standard, generalized, and nonlinear eigenvalue problems and provided some widely usable solver implementations including a block Jacobi–Davidson algorithm, contour-based integration schemes, and filter polynomial approaches. Adding to the highly efficient kernel implementations, algorithmic advances such as adaptive precision, optimized filtering coefficients, and preconditioning have further improved time to solution. These developments were guided by quantum physics applications, especially from the field of topological insulator- or graphene-based systems. For these, ScaMaC, a scalable matrix generation framework for a broad set of quantum physics problems, was developed. As the central software core of ESSEX, the PHIST library for sparse systems of linear equations and eigenvalue problems has been established. It abstracts algorithmic developments from low-level optimization. Finally, central ESSEX software components and solvers have demonstrated scalability and hardware efficiency on up to 256 K cores using million-way process/thread-level parallelism.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47956-5_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is a need to implement security over sensor cloud using a technique which involves fine-grained access in virtualized wireless sensor networks. The existing security model to secure the data transmission and stored data at the sensor-cloud environment uses different encryption techniques, but its effectiveness, efficiency, and performance can be further increased. Earlier approaches provided fine-grained access such as Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) which involves some complex computations. In this paper, we proposed a security model based on Elliptic Curve Encryption (ECC) and attributes to ensure the overall security of sensor data that guarantees the confidentiality and integrity.

To address these issues, we propose the BlockVoke scheme, which decentralizes revocations, allowing certificate owners as well as CAs to revoke certificates, and distribute revocation information rapidly. Our approach furthermore allows the revocation of CA root certificates, which is not possible with traditional approaches. The use of a blockchain as an underlying layer ensures the continued availability and immutability of revocation information.

In recent years, to provide a better recognition rate, high-definition (HD) cameras have started to be used. However, most known techniques for standard definition (SD) are not suitable for real-time HD image processing due to the computationally intensive cost of processing several-folds more of image pixels, particularly in the NPL stage. In this paper, algorithms suitable for hardware implementation for NPL and CS stages of an HD ANPR system are presented. Software implementation of the algorithms was carried on as a proof of concept, followed by hardware implementation on a heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) device that contains an ARM processor and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Heterogeneous implementation of these stages has shown that this HD NPL algorithm can localize a number plate in 16.17 ms, with a success rate of 98.0%.

Activity recognition is one of the fundamental tasks in order to provide accurate and timely assistance and service. As daily living scenarios are full of similar activities, missing data, and noise, inferring complex activities using knowledge-driven reasoning algorithms suffers from several drawbacks, e.g., real-time raw sensor data segmentation, poor generalization, higher computational complexity, and scalability. To address these problems, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to complex daily activity recognition by merging the first-order logic and probability graphic modeling. Specifically, we develop a novel “Markov logic network” combining data-driven multi-feature and simplified rule-based modeling and inference, thus enabling and supporting the applicability and robustness of daily activity recognition. To evaluate the approach and associated methods, we design a testing scenario with a number of similar activity groups, missing data, or disturbance test datasets in a multi-modeling sensor scene. Initial results show our approach outperforms the traditional approach with a better accuracy in the situations of similar activities with missing data and noise disturbance. Experiments are also conducted to compare the Gibbs sampling and MC-SAT sampling algorithms for Markov logic network, and the results show that the Gibbs is better in our experimental settings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13638-019-1553-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Sixty relevant papers, published between 2000 and 2016, were reviewed and analyzed. This analysis revealed that home healthcare service was one of the main application areas of IoT in healthcare. Cloud-based architecture, by providing great flexibility and scalability, has been deployed in most of the reviewed studies. Communication technologies including wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, radio-frequency identification (RFID), ZigBee, and Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPAN) were frequently used in different IoT models.

Both researchers and organizations have recognized the value of VGI content, however this content is typically heterogeneous in quality and spatial coverage. As a consequence, in order for applications to benefit from it, its quality and reliability need to be assessed in advance. This may not be easy since, typically, it is unknown how the process of collecting and organizing the VGI content has been conducted and by whom. In the literature, various proposals focus on an indirect process of quality assessment based on reputation scores. Following this perspective, the present paper provides as main contributions: (i) a multi-layer architecture for VGI which supports a process of reputation evaluation; (ii) a new comprehensive model for computing reputation scores for both VGI data and contributors, based on direct and indirect evaluations expressed by users, and including the concept of data aging; (iii) a variety of experiments evaluating the accuracy of the model.

In addition to causing substantial number of casualties and high pollution rates, these congestions are decelerating economic growth by reducing mobility of people and goods as well as increasing the loss of working hours and fuel consumption. In order to deal with this problem, extensive research works have successively focused on predicting road traffic jams and then predicting their propagations. In spite of their relevance, the proposed solutions to traffic jam propagation have been profoundly dependent on historical data. They have not also used their predictions to intelligently allocate traffic control resources accordingly. We, therefore, propose in this paper a new two-stage traffic resource dispatching solution which is ultimately aiming to implement a self-organizing traffic control system based on Internet of Things. Our solution uses in its first phase a Markov Random Field (MRF) to model and predict the spread of traffic congestions over a road network. According to the obtained predictions, the solution uses Markov Decision Process (MDP) to automatically allocate the road traffic resources.

As reactive strategies cause delays in the allocation of resources, proactive approaches that use predictions are necessary. However, due to high variance of cloud host load compared to that of grid computing, providing accurate predictions is still a challenge. Thus, in this paper we have proposed a prediction method based on Long Short-Term Memory Encoder–Decoder (LSTM-ED) to predict both mean load over consecutive intervals and actual load multi-step ahead. Our LSTM-ED-based approach improves the memory capability of LSTM, which is used in the recent previous work, by building an internal representation of time series data. In order to evaluate our approach, we have conducted experiments using a 1-month trace of a Google data centre with more than twelve thousand machines. Our experimental results show that while multi-layer LSTM causes overfitting and decrease in accuracy compared to single-layer LSTM, which was used in the previous work, our LSTM-ED-based approach successfully achieves higher accuracy than other previous models, including the recent LSTM one.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-019-02967-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, conventional systems can hardly be deployed in real-world settings since they typically require objects to either deliberately cooperate or carry a wireless active device or identification tag. To accomplish complicated successive tasks using a single device in real time, we propose the simultaneous use of a smart metasurface imager and recognizer, empowered by a network of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for adaptively controlling data flow. Here, three ANNs are employed in an integrated hierarchy, transforming measured microwave data into images of the whole human body, classifying specifically designated spots (hand and chest) within the whole image, and recognizing human hand signs instantly at a Wi-Fi frequency of 2.4 GHz. Instantaneous in situ full-scene imaging and adaptive recognition of hand signs and vital signs of multiple non-cooperative people were experimentally demonstrated. We also show that the proposed intelligent metasurface system works well even when it is passively excited by stray Wi-Fi signals that ubiquitously exist in our daily lives. The reported strategy could open up a new avenue for future smart cities, smart homes, human-device interaction interfaces, health monitoring, and safety screening free of visual privacy issues. Combining radio-frequency imaging with artificial intelligence could make it easier for computers to interact with individuals using non-verbal cues, such as sign language. Lianlin Li from Peking University in Beijing, China and Tie Jun Cui from Southeast University in Nanjing, China, and co-workers fabricated a meter-scale flat panel containing ‘meta-atoms’, tiny electronic devices that manipulate the phases of light waves, arranged in a grid-like pattern. By emitting microwave signals or manipulating stray Wi-Fi signals and detecting echoes bounced back, the metasurface can collect high-resolution imaging data on multiple non-cooperative subjects, even those behind solid walls. The teams fed the microwave data to a series of artificial intelligence algorithms that first identify human shapes, modify signal distributions to better focus on specific body parts, and recognize people's hand signs and vital signs . Experiments showed this setup could continuously monitor hand signals and breathing, even using stray Wi-Fi signals that ubiquitously exist in the daily lives.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41377-019-0209-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the key elements of smart farming is the farm management information systems (FMISs) that supports the automation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning, decision making, documenting, and managing the farm operations. An increased number of FMISs now adopt internet of things (IoT) technology to further optimize the targeted business goals. Obviously IoT systems in agriculture typically have different functional and quality requirements such as choice of communication protocols, the data processing capacity, the security level, safety level, and time performance. For developing an IoT-based FMIS, it is important to design the proper architecture that meets the corresponding requirements. To guide the architect in designing the IoT based farm management information system that meets the business objectives a systematic approach is provided. To this end a design-driven research approach is adopted in which feature-driven domain analysis is used to model the various smart farming requirements.

Future WSNs systems demand that connected devices could be able to work autonomously, while surfing on-line generated data and process them for self-decision making. Accordingly, we propose a cognitive Information-Centric Sensor Network (ICSN) framework. The fundamentals of cognition in ICSN can be recognized as a promising direction in addressing opportunities and challenges posed by the needs of WSNs. Nevertheless, these fundamental concepts could be difficult to implement due to the wide spectrum of tasks to be covered from the perspective of each device in the WSN. Consequently, we propose the use of Cognitive Nodes (CNs) in typical sensor networks to provide intelligent information processing and knowledge-based services to the end-users. The CNs act on queries from the end-user, containing information about the nature of the request, without the need to modify and/or change any component at the end nodes from where data is collected. We present the detailed architecture and deployment strategy of the cognitive inspired framework that learns and exploits an expanded network information from relays and clustered sensors. Extensive simulation results show that in a network with randomly deployed sensor nodes, CNs can be strategically deployed at pre-determined positions, to ensure that end-user’s Quality of Information (QoI) requirements are met, even under heavy traffic conditions and extensive packets’ payloads.

In this platform have been defined two autonomic cycles, one based on a classification task that determines the current operational state to define the set of tasks to execute in the communication system to guarantee a given QoS. The other one is based on a clustering task that discovers the current operational state and, based on it, determines the set of tasks to be executed in the communication system.

For that, a real scenario has been considered, with simulations that have generated data to test both tasks.

However, this assumption must be challenged because increasingly large amounts of health and well-being data are being gathered and deployed in cross-sectoral contexts such as social media and through the internet of (medical) things and wearable devices. Cross-sectoral sharing of data thus refers to the generation, use and linkage of biomedical data beyond the health sector. This paper considers the challenges that arise from this phenomenon. If we are to benefit fully, it is important to consider which ethical values are at stake and to reflect on ways to resolve emerging ethical issues across ecosystems where values, laws and cultures might be quite distinct. In considering such issues, this paper applies the deliberative balancing approach of the Ethics Framework for Big Data in Health and Research (Xafis et al. 2019 ) to the domain of cross-sectoral big data.

Various kinds of smart devices have been launched and applied in our daily lives to provide services for individuals; however, the existing computing frameworks including local silo-based and cloud-based architectures, are not quite fit for personal computing services. Meanwhile, personal computing applications exhibit special features, they are latency-sensitive, energy efficient, highly reliable, mobile, etc, which further indicates that a new computing architecture is urgently needed to support such services. Thanks to the emerging edge computing paradigm, we were inspired to apply the distributed cooperative computing idea at the data source, which perfectly solves issues occurring among existing computing paradigms while meeting the requirements of personal computing services. Therefore, we explore personal computing services utilizing the edge computing paradigm, discuss the overall edge-based system architecture for personal computing services, and design the conceptual framework for an edge-based personal computing system. We analyze the functionalities in detail. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a fall detection application is simulated in our preliminary evaluation as an example service in which three Support Vector Machine based fall detection algorithms with different kernel functions are implemented. Experimental results show edge computing architecture can improve the performance of the system in terms of total latency, with about 22.75% reduction on average in the case of applying 4G at the second hop even when the data and computing stream of the application is small.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-018-00697-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The lack of available parking places leads to the problem of traffic congestion and consequently to pollution, since drivers will spend a lot of time looking for a vacant parking place. Hence the need to establish a parking management system able to improve the exploitation of the existent parking places at a city level. This paper proposes a new multi agent system for parking vacancies detection based on vision techniques. We explore a network of interconnected video surveillance cameras and parking stations to provide an intelligent service to the drivers in order to facilitate their task and improve the exploitation of the parking resources.

A huge number of tangible applications have been developed in this domain. The main advantages of such networks are their easy deployment, scalability, and robustness. However, the sparseness of these networks is an inherent characteristic that is known to be a bottleneck. The main objective of this work was to provide an alternative solution for the intermittently connected FANET by considering the philosophy of the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) approach. To realize the functionality of the DTN protocols in a three-dimensional (3D) space, a social FANET model is proposed. FANET nodes are supposed to have a sparse node density. Fundamentally, the proposed DTN assisted Flying Ad hoc Network exploits the DTN routing and mobility features. The new mobility modeling for 3D spaces was re-engineered and tested with well-known routing protocols to analyze the performance of the model based on node speed, density, buffer, latency, message overhead, and power consumption. The effectiveness of 3D mobility models has also been compared against the one of classical models.

Some users may be blocked from getting their requested services due to this high load. Using a two-hop relay architecture can help in increasing the system capacity, increasing coverage area, decreasing energy consumption, and reducing the BS load. Clustering techniques can be used to configure the nodes in such two-layer topology. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relay selection based on the Basic Sequential Algorithmic Scheme (BSAS) along with power control protocol. Unlike other capacity improving techniques such as small cells and relay stations this approach does not require additional infrastructure. Instead, users themselves will act as a temporary relay stations. Modifications are implemented to the original BSAS to make it suitable for LTE environment and to improve its performance. The protocol for resource allocation and power control is implemented assuming a multi cell scenario. The algorithm is compared to other relaying and clustering schemes in addition to the conventional LTE.

Currently, two main factors prevent wireless network operators from building such networks: (1) the lack of control of the wireless environment, whose impact on the radio waves cannot be customized, and (2) the current operation of wireless radios, which consume a lot of power because new signals are generated whenever data has to be transmitted. In this paper, we challenge the usual “more data needs more power and emission of radio waves” status quo, and motivate that future wireless networks necessitate a smart radio environment: a transformative wireless concept, where the environmental objects are coated with artificial thin films of electromagnetic and reconfigurable material (that are referred to as reconfigurable intelligent meta-surfaces), which are capable of sensing the environment and of applying customized transformations to the radio waves. Smart radio environments have the potential to provide future wireless networks with uninterrupted wireless connectivity, and with the capability of transmitting data without generating new signals but recycling existing radio waves. We will discuss, in particular, two major types of reconfigurable intelligent meta-surfaces applied to wireless networks. The first type of meta-surfaces will be embedded into, e.g., walls, and will be directly controlled by the wireless network operators via a software controller in order to shape the radio waves for, e.g., improving the network coverage. The second type of meta-surfaces will be embedded into objects, e.g., smart t-shirts with sensors for health monitoring, and will backscatter the radio waves generated by cellular base stations in order to report their sensed data to mobile phones. These functionalities will enable wireless network operators to offer new services without the emission of additional radio waves, but by recycling those already existing for other purposes. This paper overviews the current research efforts on smart radio environments, the enabling technologies to realize them in practice, the need of new communication-theoretic models for their analysis and design, and the long-term and open research issues to be solved towards their massive deployment. In a nutshell, this paper is focused on discussing how the availability of reconfigurable intelligent meta-surfaces will allow wireless network operators to redesign common and well-known network communication paradigms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13638-019-1438-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although indoor localization plays a pivotal role in making the environment smarter, it is still very difficult to compare state-of-the-art localization algorithms due to the scarcity of standard databases. Publicly available databases are neither fine-grained nor contain data for different conditions. Received Signal Strength Indicator ( RSSI ) of Wi-Fi signals vary with indoor environment (open/closed room, presence/absence of user, temperature etc.) and scanning smart hand-held devices. Thus, localization accuracy varies with various environmental conditions and also granularity of location points (cell). Consequently, in this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a comprehensive indoor localization dataset, subject to different domains-spatial, temporal, context and device. RSSI data has been collected with cell sizes as small as $$1\,{\mathrm{m}}\times 1\,{\mathrm{m}}$$ 1 m × 1 m from three floors of a building of our University using an Android application built for this purpose. This multi-floor dataset is available online at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_z1qhoRIcpineP9AHkfVGCfB2Fd_e-fD. Our experimental results show that maximum of $$71.78\%$$ 71.78 % classification accuracy can be achieved for state-of-the-art classifiers when training and testing samples are taken in different environmental conditions and from smartphones having different configurations. Single classifier cannot easily be modified to suit these variations without loosing its generality. So, to overcome these conditional dependencies, our second contribution is to propose a framework for indoor localization, JUIndoorLoc and design an ensemble of condition specific classifiers as part of the framework to take care of context and device heterogeneity. Consequently, this ensemble of condition specific classifiers is implemented and found to predict a location with $$91.74\%$$ 91.74 % accuracy (1.87 m) for our dataset.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-019-06188-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Preventative security mechanisms are often not enough to keep attackers out so a second layer of security in the form of intrusion detection is paramount in order to limit the damage of successful attacks. In this paper several traditional anomaly detection techniques are evaluated in the context of attack detection in water distribution systems. These algorithms were centrally trained on the entire feature space and compared to multi-stage detection techniques that were designed to isolate both local and global anomalies. A novel ensemble technique that combines density-based and parametric algorithms was also developed and tested in the application environment. The traditional techniques had comparable results to the multi-stage systems and when used in conjunction with a local anomaly detector the performances of these algorithms were greatly improved. The developed ensemble technique also had promising results outperforming the density-based techniques and having comparable results to the parametric algorithms.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13673-019-0175-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Privacy would actually demand hiding the sheer fact that communication takes place. This requires to protect meta-data from observation. We motivate the need for strong privacy protection in a smart home use case by highlighting the privacy issues that cannot be solved by confidentiality mechanisms like encryption alone. Our solution is a implementation of DC-net on Re-Mote sensor nodes running Contiki OS. From this, we conclude that the computational and network overheads imposed by these techniques do not make them impractical to use in the IoT. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first implementation of DC-net on sensors. Alongside, we provide a survey of the required strong cryptographic security mechanisms, like encryption of communication, to be in place. We describe how the current existing techniques can be facilitated to achieve unobservable communication for the IoT. This includes mechanisms for encrypted IoT communication like DTLS or message authentication like ECDSA signatures on IoT devices. For readers unfamiliar with the concepts of MIXing and DC-net, we explain and analyse how those techniques, formerly used to provide private communication in the Internet, can be applied to the IoT. We briefly survey what complementary features from the IoT architecture are helpful in providing strong protection in this particular use case.

However, with the arrival of the Internet of Things, huge data are generated from these devices. Thus, there is the need for bringing characteristics of cloud closer to the request generator, so that processing of these huge data takes place at one-hop distance closer to that end user. This led to the emergence of fog computing with the aim to provide storage and computation at the edge of the network that reduces network traffic and overcomes many cloud computing drawbacks.

The design of these objects gives rise to new opportunities but requires taking into account a number of dimensions that contribute to smartness. In our view, supported by considerable literature on this subject, smart behavior is the result of proper combinations of several dimensions of intelligence. In the paper we analyze these dimensions, singling out different alternatives leading to different capabilities of smart objects. The contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to guide a designer in making decisions about smartness in the physical object being designed, starting from its requisites. At the same time the framework provides an effective guide to classify and compare smart physical objects according to the type and level of smartness they exhibit.

However, application of object detection algorithms in real-time systems demand minimal computation time and comprehensive performance analysis needs to be conducted before deployment. This paper aims to conduct performance analysis of deep learning based algorithm i.e. single shot detector (SSD) in IoT based embedded devices for smart home appliances control. We have developed a smart home automation system using object detection algorithm based on model view controller (MVC) architecture deployed on Cloud of Things (CoT) i.e. Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud for users to remotely monitor their homes. Message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol is used for communication with connected IoT devices. For load-balancing, we have proposed the concept of distributed broker to support high number of publishers and subscribers. For experimental analysis, we have connected a camera with Raspberry Pi for object detection based on deep learning algorithm (SSD) using OpenCV library in our proposed system. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of object detection algorithm under varying environmental conditions by changing the light intensity level, distance of object from camera, and frame size of video. Results show that communication delay is very low (i.e. 0.2 s) as compared to processing delay in Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, changing environmental conditions have very low/insignificant impact on the processing delay of object detection algorithm i.e. average delay of 1.7 s (stdev. 0.18) and 1.8 s (stdev. 0.24) in bright and dark lighting levels, respectively. However, accuracy is deteriorated under low lighting intensity level and increased frame sizes i.e. from 95–100 to 80–85%.

Having gained momentum and traction as a promising response to the needed transition towards sustainability and to the challenges of urbanisation, smart and smarter cities as approaches to data-driven urbanism are increasingly adopting the advanced forms of ICT to improve their performance in line with the goals of sustainable development and the requirements of urban growth. One of such forms that has tremendous potential to enhance urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies in this direction is big data analytics and its application. This is due to the kind of well-informed decision-making and enhanced insights enabled by big data computing in the form of applied intelligence. However, topical studies on big data technologies and their applications in the context of smart and smarter cities tend to deal largely with economic growth and the quality of life in terms of service efficiency and betterment while overlooking and barely exploring the untapped potential of such applications for advancing sustainability. In fact, smart and smarter cities raise several issues and involve significant challenges when it comes to their development and implementation in the context of sustainability. With that in regard, this paper provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review and synthesis of the field of smart and smarter cities in relation to sustainability and related big data analytics and its application in terms of the underlying foundations and assumptions, research issues and debates, opportunities and benefits, technological developments, emerging trends, future practices, and challenges and open issues. This study shows that smart and smarter cities are associated with misunderstanding and deficiencies as regards their incorporation of, and contribution to, sustainability. Nevertheless, as also revealed by this study, tremendous opportunities are available for utilising big data analytics and its application in smart cities of the future to improve their contribution to the goals of sustainable development by optimising and enhancing urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies, as well as by finding answers to challenging analytical questions and thereby advancing knowledge forms.

To support these low-latency and interactive use cases, Real-Time Communication (RTC) solutions are generally used. WebRTC is an open-source project for real-time browser-based conferencing, developed with a peer-to-peer architecture in mind. In this peer-to-peer architecture, each sending peer needs to encode a separate, independent stream for each receiving peer participating in the remote session, which makes this approach expensive in terms of encoders and not able to scale well for a large number of users. This paper proposes a WebRTC-compliant framework to solve this scalability issue, without impacting the quality delivered to the remote peers. In the proposed framework, each sending peer is only equipped with a limited number of encoders, much smaller than and independent of the number of receiving peers. Consequently, each encoder transmits to a multitude of receivers at the same time, to improve scalability. A centralized node based on the Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) principle, called conference controller, forwards the best stream to the receiving peers, based on their bandwidth conditions. Moreover, the conference controller dynamically recomputes the encoding bitrates of the sending peers, to maximize the quality delivered to the receiving peers. This approach allows to closely follow the long-term bandwidth variations of the receivers, even with a limited number of encoders at sender-side, and increase the delivered video quality. An integer linear programming formulation for the bitrate recomputation problem is presented, which can be optimally solved when the number of receivers is small. An approximate, scalable method is also proposed using the K-means clustering algorithm. The gains brought by the proposed framework have been confirmed in both simulation and emulation, through a testbed implementation using the Google Chrome browser and the open-source Jitsi-Videobridge software. Particularly, we focus on a remote collaboration scenario where the interaction among the remote participants is dominated by a single peer, as in a remote teaching scenario. When a single sending peer equipped with three encoders transmits to 28 receiving peers, the proposed framework improves the average received video bitrate up to 15%, compared to a static solution where the encoding bitrates do not change over time. Moreover, the dynamic bitrate recomputation is more efficient than a static association in terms of encoders used at sender-side. For the same configuration mentioned above, the same received bitrate is obtained in the static case using four encoders as in the dynamic case using three encoders.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-018-6460-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A major challenge for automated emotion detection is that emotions are subjective concepts with fuzzy boundaries and with variations in expression and perception. To address this issue, a dimensional model of affect is utilized to define emotion classes. Further, a soft classification approach is proposed to measure the probability of assigning a message to each emotion class. We develop and evaluate a supervised learning system to automatically classify emotion in text stream messages. Our approach includes two main tasks: an offline training task and an online classification task. The first task creates models to classify emotion in text messages. For the second task, we develop a two-stage framework called EmotexStream to classify live streams of text messages for the real-time emotion tracking.

To solve this challenge, this paper proposes the multimedia based intelligent network big data optimization model.

Forward when the data flows through the module, the data layer memory modules can be according to the requirements of component control level and store the corresponding service content, and further described the service identification and service information notices to component level control.

We propose Dynamic Pricing with Traffic Engineering (DPTE), a prototype that generates traffic distribution using a market-driven model. In DPTE, users specify required rates, and a price module gives the current value based on observation of the states of servers as well as networks. DPTE periodically runs a heuristic algorithm that selects the path with the appropriate pricing to guarantee the service based on the software-defined content delivery networking (SDCDN) platform. As a result, DPTE not only relies on pricing to reflect the objective properties from the performance perspective but also utilizes pricing rules to influence the choice of users.

IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of ( n  = 3064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22% ( n  = 2/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78% ( n  = 7/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users’ entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37% ( n  = 17/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91% ( n  = 12/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications.

Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher’s interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT.

This is owing to the underlying power of thinking data-analytically about sustainability in terms of finding answers to challenging questions for addressing the wicked problems and disentangling the intractable issues related to the practice of urbanism: operational functioning, planning, design, and development. In the meantime, as widely acknowledged within the field of smart and sustainable urbanism as regards academic and scientific research, ‘small data’ studies are associated with high cost, infrequent periodicity, quick obsolescence, incompleteness, inaccuracy, as well as inherent subjectivity and biases. In addition, such studies capture a relatively limited sample of data that is tightly focused, less representative, restricted in scope and scale, time and space specific, and relatively expensive to generate and analyze. Indeed, much of our knowledge of urbanism has been gleaned from scholarly studies characterized by data scarcity and involving the use of traditional data collection and analysis methods with inherent limitations and constraints. Therefore, this chapter endeavors to develop, illustrate, and discuss a systematic framework for city analytics and ‘big data’ studies in relation to the domain of smart sustainable/sustainable smart urbanism based on cross-industry standard process for data mining. This endeavor is in response to the emerging paradigm of big data computing and the increasing role of underpinning technologies in operating, organizing, planning, and designing smart sustainable cities as a leading paradigm of urbanism. The intention is to utilize and apply well-informed, knowledge-driven decision-making and enhanced insights to improve and optimize urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies in line with the long-term goals of sustainability. I argue that there is tremendous potential for advancing smart sustainable urbanism or transforming the knowledge of smart sustainable cities through creating a data deluge that can, through analytics, provide much more sophisticated, finer-grained, wider-scale, real-time understanding and control of various aspects of urbanity in the undoubtedly upcoming Exabyte/Zettabyte Age.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17312-8_9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

At the heart of this emerging era of data-driven urbanism is a computational understanding of urban systems and processes that reduces urban life to a set of logic, calculative, and algorithmic rules and procedures. Such understanding entails drawing together, interlinking, and analyzing urban big data to provide a more holistic and integrated view and synoptic intelligence of the city. This is being increasingly directed for improving, advancing, and maintaining the contribution of both sustainable cities and smart cities to the goals of sustainable development. Indeed, a new era is presently unfolding wherein smart sustainable urbanism is increasingly becoming data-driven. In light of this, smart sustainable urbanism has become even more complex with the very technologies being used to make sense of and deal with it as involving special conundrums, wicked problems, intractable issues, and complex challenges associated mainly with sustainability and urbanization. Consequently, to tackle smart sustainable cities requires, I contend, innovative solutions and sophisticated approaches as to the way they can be monitored, understood, and analyzed so as to be effectively operated, managed, planned, designed, developed, and governed in line with the long-term goals of sustainability. Therefore, this chapter examines and discusses the approach to data-driven smart sustainable urbanism in terms of computerized decision support and making, intelligence functions, simulation models, and optimization and prediction methods. It also documents and highlights the potential of the integration of these advanced technologies for facilitating the synergy between the operational functioning, planning, design, and development of smart sustainable cities. I argue that data-driven urbanism is the mode of production for smart sustainable cities, which are accordingly becoming knowable, tractable, and controllable in new dynamic ways thanks to urban science and complexity science. I conclude that the upcoming developments and innovations in big data computing and the underpinning technologies, coupled with the evolving deluge of urban data, hold great potential for enhancing and advancing the different practices of smart sustainable urbanism. This work contributes to bringing data-analytic thinking and practice to smart sustainable urbanism, in addition to drawing special attention to the crucial role and enormous benefits of the emerging paradigm of big data computing as to transforming the future form of such urbanism.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17312-8_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Having gained momentum and traction as a promising response to the needed transition toward sustainability and to the challenges of urbanization, smart and smarter cities as urban planning and development strategies (or urbanism approaches) are increasingly adopting the advanced forms of ICT to improve their performance in line with the goals of sustainable development and the requirements of urban growth. One of such forms that has tremendous potential to enhance urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies in this direction is big data computing and its application. It was not until recently that the realization grew about the benefits of exploiting the big data deluge and its extensive sources to better monitor, understand, analyze, and plan smart and smarter cities to improve their contribution to sustainability. However, topical studies on big data applications in the context of smart and smarter cities tend to deal largely with economic growth and the quality of life in terms of service efficiency and betterment, while overlooking and barely exploring the untapped potential of such applications for advancing sustainability. In fact, smart and smarter cities raise several issues and involve significant challenges when it comes to their development and implementation in the context of sustainability. This chapter provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review and synthesis of the field of smart and smarter cities in regard to sustainability and related big data analytics and its application in terms of the underlying foundations and assumptions, research issues and debates, opportunities and benefits, technological developments, emerging trends, future practices, and challenges and open issues. This study shows that smart and smarter cities are associated with misunderstanding and deficiencies as regards their incorporation of, and contribution to, sustainability, respectively. Nevertheless, as also revealed by this study, tremendous opportunities are available for utilizing big data applications in smart cities of the future or smarter cities to improve their contribution to the goals of sustainable development through optimizing and enhancing urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies, as well as finding answers to challenging analytical questions and advancing knowledge forms. However, just as there are immense opportunities ahead to embrace and exploit, there are enormous challenges ahead to address and overcome in order to achieve a successful implementation of big data technology and its novel applications in such cities. These findings will help strategic city stakeholders understand what they can do more to advance sustainability based on big data applications, and also give policymakers an opportunity to identify areas for further improvement while leveraging areas of strength with regard to the future form of sustainable smart urbanism.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17312-8_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In addition, they are required to take into account several scalability, efficiency, safety, real-time responses, and smartness issues. All of this means that building smart city applications is extremely complex. Swarm Intelligence is a very promising paradigm to deal with such complex and dynamic systems. It presents robust, scalable and self-organized behaviors to deal with dynamic and fast changing systems. The intelligence of cities can be modeled as a swarm of digital telecommunication networks (the nerves), ubiquitously embedded intelligence (the brains), sensors and tags (the sensory organs), and software (the knowledge and cognitive competence). In this chapter, swarm intelligence-based algorithms and existing swarm intelligence-based smart city solutions will be analyzed. Moreover, a swarm-based framework for smart cities will be presented. Then, a set of trends on how to use swarm intelligence in smart cities, in order to make them flexible and scalable, will be investigated.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-96550-5_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Of particular relevance, it is instigating a massive change in the way both smart cities and sustainable cities are studied and understood, and in how they are planned, designed, operated, managed, and governed in the face of urbanization. This relates to what has been dubbed data-driven smart sustainable urbanism, an emerging approach which is based on a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logical and algorithmic rules and procedures and that employs new scientific methods and principles, while also harnessing urban big data to provide a more holistic and integrated view or synoptic intelligence of the city. This is underpinned by epistemological realism and instrumental rationality, which sustain and are shaped by urban science. However, all knowledge is socially constructed and historically situated, so too are research methods and applied research as related to S&T and as historically produced social formations and practices that circumscribe and produce culturally specific forms of knowledge and reality. This chapter examines the unprecedented paradigmatic, scientific, scholarly, epistemic, and discursive shifts the field of smart sustainable urbanism is undergoing in light of big data science and analytics and the underlying advanced technologies, as well as discusses how these shifts intertwine with and affect one another, and their sociocultural specificity and historical situatedness. I argue that data-intensive science as a new paradigmatic shift is fundamentally changing the scientific and practical foundations of urban sustainability. In specific terms, the new urban science—as underpinned by sustainability science—is increasingly making cities more sustainable, resilient, efficient, livable, and equitable by rendering them more measurable, knowable, and tractable in terms of their operational functioning, management, planning, design, and development.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17312-8_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To ensure safety and comfort while driving its passengers, the vehicle has to rely on the newest traffic and map updates at any time. Furthermore the passengers want to enjoy infotainment services like video and music streaming during the travel. All these kinds of services require a reliable and fast cellular internet connection. However due to the high speed of the vehicle and the varying deployed cellular infrastructure, the experienced network throughput is constantly changing. To predict those throughput changes and to maintain the overall experienced network quality at a high level, machine learning techniques can be leveraged. In our previous work [ 1 ], we first investigated the idea to train machine learning techniques based on specifically localized training data provided by modern day smartphone APIs in a so-called connectivity map to improve their overall performance. From the first promising results obtained in this work, we now further improved the quality of our input feature set in this current work by introducing more precise lower level protocol information to the prediction process. The measurements were obtained from the same real highway driving scenario over a period of three days, in which over 540.000 precise lower layer throughput estimations could be collected.

Further, an example of electric vehicle routing problem is provided to identify various effective networks in the broader context of sustainable interdependent networks. In the second volume of Sustainable Interdependent Networks book, we focus on the interdependencies of power and transportation networks, optimization methods to deal with the computational complexity of them, and their role in future smart cities. In a related context, we further investigate other influential networks, such as communication networks. The considerable scale of such networks, due to the large number of buses in smart power grids and the increasing number of electric vehicles in transportation networks, brings a wide variety of computational complexity and optimization challenges.

Traditional approaches largely use GPS data to assess drivers. However, it is difficult to fine-grained assess the time-varying driving behaviors. In this paper, we employ the increasingly popular On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) equipment, which measures semantic-rich vehicle information, to extract detailed trajectory and behavior data for analysis. We propose PBE system, which consists of Trajectory Profiling Model ( P M), Driver Behavior Model ( B M) and Risk Evaluation Model ( E M). PM profiles trajectories for reminding drivers of danger in real-time. The labeled trajectories can be utilized to boost the training of BM and EM for driver risk assessment when data is incomplete. BM evaluates the driving risk using fine-grained driving behaviors on a trajectory level. Its output incorporated with the time-varying pattern, is combined with the driver-level demographic information for the final driver risk assessment in EM. Meanwhile, the whole PBE system also considers the real-world cost-sensitive application scenarios. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the performance of PBE in risk assessment outperforms the traditional systems by at least 21%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10997-4_31,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, it is both challenging and impractical for organizations to migrate from traditional network architecture to full SDN architecture overnight. Therefore, the migration plan is performed in stages, resulting in a new type of network termed hybrid SDN (H-SDN). Effective migration and traffic scheduling in H-SDN environment are the two areas of challenges organizations face. Various solutions have been proposed in the literatures to address these two challenges. Differing from the approaches taken in the literatures, this work utilizes visual analytic and machine learning to address the two challenges. In both full SDN and H-SDN environment, literatures showed that data analytics applications have been successfully developed for various purposes as network security, traffic monitoring and traffic engineering. The success of data analytic applications is highly dependent on prior data analysis from both automated processing and human analysis. However, with the increasing volume of traffic data and the complex networking environment in both SDN and H-SDN networks, the need for both visual analytic and machine learning in inevitable for effective data analysis of network problems. Hence, the objectives of this article are three-folds: Firstly, to identify the limitations of the existing migration plan and traffic scheduling in H-SDN, followed by highlighting the challenges of the existing research works on SDN analytics in various network applications, and lastly, to propose the future research directions of SDN migration and H-SDN traffic scheduling through visual analytics and machine learning.

Automated and accurate IoT device fingerprinting is a prerequisite step for realizing secure, reliable, and high-quality IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach for passive fingerprinting of IoT device types through automatic classification of encrypted IoT network flows.

The proliferation of social media and domotics urges a new kind of ubiquity where different kinds of features are deployed everywhere atop of the everyday life small devices and even embedded in our surroundings. While we measure the opportunities offered by such advancements in improving people lifestyles and obtaining immediate and useful services, it is necessary to consider the real impact on our privacy. Recently, a newly adopted European standard, the General Data Protection Regulation aims at codifying the rules of personal data use. We strongly believe in the necessity for a Smart City of adopting such privacy regulation while benefiting at the same time from new services, in a generic and easy way. In that sense, we build an approach that is at the frontier of the cryptoscience domain for a better privacy and the Micro Service-Oriented Architectures for an increased use by tiers. Indeed, our service is accessible in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) manner and uses encryption to ensure data privacy. The particularity of our system lies in the fact that the server performs a classification algorithm without any information about the sensitive data and without the capability to decrypt it. The underlying cryptographic technology used is homomorphic encryption, allowing to perform calculations directly on encrypted data. Our service is generic by design and could be applied over several metrics. We adopt an energy efficiency use case and propose a service for buildings energy diagnosis and classification towards renovations and/or reductions of the electric consumption. We showcase our prototype of crypto-classification service by involving different actors of a Smart City community.

In particular, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly approaching critical areas such as medicine, autonomous vehicles, criminal justice, and financial markets. Such a trend is producing a growing AI-Human society entanglement. Thus, several concerns are raised around user acceptance of AI agents. Trust issues, mainly due to their lack of explainability, are the most relevant. In recent decades, the priority has been pursuing the optimal performance at the expenses of the interpretability. It led to remarkable achievements in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. However, the crucial questions driven by the social reluctance to accept AI-based decisions may lead to entirely new dynamics and technologies fostering explainability, authenticity, and user-centricity. This paper proposes a joint approach employing both blockchain technology (BCT) and explainability in the decision-making process of MAS. By doing so, current opaque decision-making processes can be made more transparent and secure and thereby trustworthy from the human user standpoint. Moreover, several case studies involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are discussed.

To take full benefit of smart metering intelligence, numbers of technical issues are required to be addressed. The major concern is to work with very large volume of data. There is a need to develop efficient data fusion and integration techniques. Numerous big data integration and analytics engines are required, which can perform tasks such as outage management, asset management and fault detection especially in case of DR system, customer segmenting, load forecasting and targeting.

In this chapter, we discuss the use of visible light communications Visible Light Communication (VLC) ( VLC Visible Light Communication (VLC) ) within the IIoT paradigm. VLC considers the use of light sources and photodetectors operating in the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., light-emitting diodes) for communication purposes. Since VLC works in the visible band, it does not further congest the already over-crowded radio frequency Radio frequency (RF) bands. VLC is also secure, RF interference-free, low-cost, and energy efficient. Thus, it has been considered for utilization in many application areas such as intelligent transport Intelligent transport systems, indoor localization, and communication in RF-sensitive zones. In this chapter, while discussing the advantages and limitations of using VLC in IIoT systems, we further explore the possible utilization of bi-directional LED Light Emitting Diodes (LED) to LED communication within this scope for very low-cost communication devices. Finally, we discuss current and possible future applications of VLC in the IIoT context, identifying the following as potential future applications: LED-Based IIoT sensor data transmissions, LED beaconing LED beaconing for localization and signaling, wearable VLC devices for safety, VLC for ubiquitous computing Ubiquitous computing , VLC-supported augmented reality Augmented reality , VLC for smart farming Smart farming , VLC-assisted energy load scheduling, VLC-supported industrial Internet of Underwater Things, VLC-offloaded telecom services, and VLC usage in the transportation industry Transportation industry .",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24892-5_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Accordingly, populations of speaking objects will define dense and massive multiagent systems, devoted to monitor and control our environments, let them be homes, industries or, in the large-scale, whole cities. In this context, the necessary coordination among speaking objects will be likely to become associated with the capability of argumenting about situations and about the current state of the affairs, triggering and directing proper distributed conversations, and eventually collectively reach future desirable state of the affairs.

We define an unexpected change in the traffic counts as an anomalous local event . Reliable discovery of such events is very important in real-world applications such as real-time crash detection or traffic congestion detection. One of the main challenges to detecting anomalous local events is to distinguish them from legitimate global traffic changes, which happen due to seasonal effects, weather and holidays. Existing anomaly detection techniques often raise many false alarms for these legitimate traffic changes, making such techniques less reliable. To address this issue, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection system that represents relationships between different locations in a city. Our method uses training data to estimate the traffic count at each sensor location given the traffic counts at the other locations. The estimation error is then used to calculate the anomaly score at any given time and location in the network. We test our method on two real traffic datasets collected in the city of Melbourne, Australia, for detecting anomalous local events. Empirical results show the greater robustness of our method to legitimate global changes in traffic count than four benchmark anomaly detection methods examined in this paper.

WSN as a new category of computer-based computing platforms and network structures is showing new applications in different areas such as environmental monitoring, health care and military applications. Although there are a lot of secure data transmission schemes designed for data aggregation and transmission over a network, the limited resources and the complex environment make it invisible to be used with WSNs. Furthermore, secure data transmission is a big challenging issue in WSNs especially for the application that uses image as its main data such as military applications. This problem is mainly related to the limited resources and data processing capabilities. This chapter introduces a secure data processing and transmission schema in WSN. The chapter reviewed and critically discussed the most prominent secure clustering routing algorithms that have been developed for WSNs. Then, we explained the guidelines and the steps towards building a simple solution for securing the dynamic cluster network while consuming as little energy as possible and is adapted to a low computing power. Moreover, four phased towards building a secure clustering algorithm for WSN are proposed. These phases are secure cluster head selection, secure cluster formation, secure data aggregation by the cluster head from its cluster nodes, and secure data routing to the base station.

Despite the significance of energy, theoretical studies focusing primarily on the issue of energy within big data analytics in relation to computational intelligent algorithms are scarce. The purpose of this study is to explore the theoretical aspects of energy issues in big data analytics in relation to computational intelligent algorithms since this is critical in exploring the emperica aspects of big data. In this chapter, we present a theoretical study of energy issues related to applications of computational intelligent algorithms in big data analytics. This work highlights that big data analytics using computational intelligent algorithms generates a very high amount of energy, especially during the training phase. The transmission of big data between service providers, users and data centres emits carbon dioxide as a result of high power consumption. This chapter proposes a theoretical framework for big data analytics using computational intelligent algorithms that has the potential to reduce energy consumption and enhance performance. We suggest that researchers should focus more attention on the issue of energy within big data analytics in relation to computational intelligent algorithms, before this becomes a widespread and urgent problem.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69889-2_1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, due to environmental influence (i.e., equipment faults, noises, or security attacks) and technology limitation a wireless sensor/sensors module can neither store/process all raw data locally nor reliably forward the data to a destination in heterogeneous IoT environment. As a result, the sensing data collected by IoT/Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is inherently noisy, unreliable, and may trigger many false alarms. These false or misleading data can lead to wrong decisions once the data reaches end entities/cloud. Therefore, it is highly recommended and desirable to identify trustworthy data before data transmission, aggregation, and data storing at the end entities/cloud. In this paper, we propose an In-network Generalized Trustworthy Data Collection (IGTDC) framework for collaborative IoT environment. The key idea of IGTDC is to allow a sensor’s module to check whether or not the raw/sense data is reliable before routing to the sink/edge node. It also identifies whether the received data is trustworthy or not before aggregation at sink/edge node. Besides, IGTDC facilitates to identify a faulty sensor. For a reliable event detection in real-time without waiting for a trust report from the end entities/cloud, we use collaborative IoT, and gate-level modeling with Verilog User Defined Primitive (UDP) to make sure that the collected data/event information is reliable before sending to end entities/cloud. We use BCD 8421 (Binary Coded Decimal) in gate-level modeling as a flag which assists in identifying a faulty or compromise sensor. Through simulations with Verilog Icarus, we demonstrate that the collected data in IGTDC is trustworthy that can make trustworthy data aggregation for event detection and help to identify a faulty sensor.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-1304-6_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, in real-world scenarios, road managers need to clearly understand the type of damage and its extent in order to take effective action in advance or to allocate the necessary resources. Moreover, currently there are few uniform and openly available road damage datasets, leading to a lack of a common benchmark for road damage detection. Such dataset could be used in a great variety of applications; herein, it is intended to serve as the acquisition component of a physical asset management tool which can aid governments agencies for planning purposes, or by infrastructure maintenance companies. In this paper, we make two contributions to address these issues. First, we present a large-scale road damage dataset, which includes a more balanced and representative set of damages. This dataset is composed of 18,034 road damage images captured with a smartphone, with 45,435 instances road surface damages.

IoT allows any device with an on-and-off switch to connect to the internet—a concept that has the ability to greatly change our lives and work. These modern systems collect inherently complex data streams due to the volume, velocity, value, variety, variability, and veracity of data, which leads to incremental growth in data traffic on networks and in the cloud. To fulfill the requirements of IoT, including geodistribution, low latency, location awareness, and mobility support, a new paradigm is proposed: edge computing. In edge computing, substantial computing and storage resources are placed at the edge of the network in mobile devices or sensors. The term “edge” is taken from network diagrams; normally, the edge of a network diagram represents the point at which data traffic enters or leaves the workable network. Using the concept of edge computing, an organization can shift huge amounts of data into processed data near the data origin, which helps to reduce data traffic in the network’s central repository (called the “cloud”). Edge computing uses a variety of data reduction techniques close to the data source at the network edge, including data pre-processing, local storage, and filtering. This approach can prevent some critical issues, such as I/O bottlenecks, storage and bandwidth limitations, data traffic increments, and high energy costs. A major advantage of edge computing is improvement of the request-response delay to milliseconds. Edge computing also supports security and network challenges. However, two major obstacles exist toward achieving the benefit of network-edge computing. First, the most efficient algorithms for data reduction in time series (one of the most common types of data in IoT) were developed to work posteriori upon big datasets, but they cannot make decisions for each incoming data item. Secondly, the state of the art lacks systems that can apply any of the possible data reduction methods without adding significant delays or major reconfigurations. Edge computing has also inherited some of the challenges of cloud computing, including data abstraction, naming, and programmability. This chapter presents a detailed taxonomic discussion of edge computing, along with its challenges, opportunities, and data reduction methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-99061-3_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In scenarios such as smart cities , multiple applications are simultaneously deployed and distributed across the Cloud and fog nodes, offering various IoT-based services. Moreover, each application has its own quality of service (QoS) and resource requirements that must be met. Appropriate resource allocation mechanisms are needed to determine which fog node or group of nodes can host the services of a given application. A critical challenge is how to select fog nodes for resource allocation in order to maximize fog resources utilization and minimize service latency, while satisfying QoS requirements of the application. This paper is aimed to address this challenge through a two-phase QoS-aware resource allocation scheme. Firstly, in the layering phase, we assume a hierarchical architecture for fog nodes—organizing heterogeneous nodes into a multi-layered hierarchy based on node resources capacity and network characteristics. Layering facilitates finding fog node(s) based on application requirements, and improves resource management. In the second phase, the fog nodes are grouped to facilitate resource pooling and reducing delay in service provisioning. We use the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm for classifying fog nodes. This helps selecting those fog node(s) in a fog layer with which the latency will be minimized. We evaluate the proposed approach through simulation. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach promises high application acceptance rate (80% on average), and reduces considerably the application placement time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30143-9_17,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Even if safety is the main goal, many opportunities for technological developers are possible. Among them, Smart Cities is a major player in future communication networks. In a smart city context, hundreds or thousands of sensors will be deployed in many strategic parts of the city, including sensors in mobile devices, that can provide critical information for the city management and improve the resident’s livelihood. However, this scenario entails extremely high volumes of information to be sent to different geographical locations. Because of this, the use of cellular base stations may be a highly expensive alternative. In this work. We propose to take advantage of the use of autonomous cars as data mules for the efficient recollection of data in smart cities environments. Specifically, we consider interest points in Luxembourg City, where relevant data may be generated by sensors in mobile devices or fixed sensors in the city’s infrastructure. Assuming that, autonomous vehicles know in advance the route that they are going to follow to reach their destination, sensors can profit the passage of these vehicles to transmit their data, making short-range, low-cost transmissions and reducing the implementation cost of these applications. Later, the vehicles can relay the data on the destination point. To this end, we evaluate the potential use of this system by obtaining the main statistics variables of the passage of the vehicles though these interest points in the city.

The need for this classification arises from the wide usage of ER to indicate a diverse range of activities using robots and from the lack of clarity when describing how ER impacts students’ curricula.

However, obtaining patterns from the crowd to make a working model is difficult, as it requires an enormous quantity of data from observation and analysis and is impractical in many scenarios due to logistic and legal issues. Machine learning techniques are a good tool to overcome these difficulties, using a relatively small training data set to identify patterns, allowing crowd agents to react to similar situations accordingly. We implemented a behavioral agent model that uses such techniques into a large-scale crowd simulator, and apply inverse reinforcement learning to adjust agents’ behaviors by examples. The goal of the system is to provide to the agents a realistic behavior model and a method to orient themselves without knowing the scenario’s layout, based in learnt patterns around environment features.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20937-7_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In fact, producing accurate traffic flow predictions would be extremely useful not only for drivers but also for those more vulnerable in the road, such as pedestrians or cyclists. With a citizen-first approach in mind, forecasting models can be used to help advise citizens based on the perception of outdoor risks, dangerous behaviors and time delays, among others. Hence, this work develops and evaluates the accuracy of different ARIMA and LSTM based-models for traffic flow forecasting on data-scarce and non-data-scarce environments.

By integrating clouds with WSAN, some tasks initially assigned to smart sensors can be off-loaded to the cloud, thus benefiting from the huge computational capacity of these platforms. However, for time-critical applications, the high and unstable latency between the sensors and the cloud is not desirable. Besides low latency, WSAN applications usually require mobility and location-awareness properties, not often supported by current cloud platforms. Moreover, the indiscriminate off-loading of data/tasks from sensors to the cloud may lead to an overutilization of the network bandwidth while, in some cases, sensor-generated data could be locally processed and immediately discarded. To overcome these drawbacks of the integration between WSANs and the cloud, the edge paradigm emerges as a promising solution. Edge computing refers to enabling the computing directly at the edge of the network (for instance, through smart gateways and micro-data centers). Combining the paradigms of cloud/edge computing and WSANs in a three-tier architecture potentially leverages mutual advantages while posing novel research challenges. One of such challenges regards the development of solutions for performing resource allocation and task scheduling for CoS. Both edge and cloud paradigms strongly rely on the virtualization of physical resources. Therefore, resource allocation in CoS refers to the process of allocating instances of virtual nodes to perform the application requests (workload) submitted to the CoS, trying to meet as best as possible the requirements of applications, while respecting the constraints of the underlying physical infrastructure. Task scheduling denotes the process of selecting a group of physical nodes that are suitable for the execution, in a given order, of the various tasks necessary to meet an application request. The goal of this chapter is to overview the state of the art in the development of solutions for these two essential activities for the construction and efficient execution of CoS infrastructures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-91146-5_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In light of this, it is clear that defenders need to look beyond the first lines of defense and invest not only into prevention, but also into limiting the impact of cyber-breaches. Thus, an effective cyber-defense must combine proactive defense , which aims to block anticipated attacks, with reactive defense , which responds to and mitigates perceived attacks (e.g., isolating and shutting down compromised components). However, planning defensive actions in anticipation of and in response to strategic attacks is a challenging problem. Prior work has introduced a number of game-theoretic security models for planning defensive actions, such as Stackelberg security games, but these models do not address the overarching problem of proactive and reactive defenses in sufficient detail. To bridge this gap, we introduce a modeling approach for building high-resolution multi-stage security games. We describe several approaches for modeling proactive and reactive defenses, consider key modeling choices and challenges, and discuss finding optimal defense policies.

The rapid growth of connected devices to the Internet as well as adoption of IoT technology across business sectors have led to a careful study and development of technical standards. IoT success is highly dependent on the elaboration of inter-operable global standards within and across application domains. For example, common language (vocabulary) and standard reference architecture are a prerequisite to develop cost-effective business solutions and enable cooperation between various applications, to cover a wide range of disciplines. This paper intends to summarize the major efforts of Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and alliances towards IoT technical standardization. In particular, it identifies the implementation challenges in IoT ecosystem mainly from the perspective of technical, business, and societal. Then, it provides the level of focus of major SDOs and alliances in IoT related technical standardization on identified areas of challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31831-4_36,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The move to mobile has been nothing but positive for the accessibility of people with a visual disability. Similarly in the next 10 years as the Web becomes a utility, imbedded—embedded and invisible—and as wearables, sensors and the Internet of Things (and the Web, IoW) become more prevalent accessibility will be even more crucial. As the Web becomes more seamless, we will need to look for new ways to convey information in many different environments, and here lessons from accessibility will contribute. We have seen over the last 10 years the expansion from physical and sensory disability through cognitive and ageing to inclusion, and situational impairments. Over the next 10 years, our understanding of assistive technology will change because we cannot build for the many combinations of interactions, technologies, environments and users then assistive technology will just become ubiquitous. More attention will be paid to previously under-represented areas such as cognitive and autism spectrum conditions as well as those surrounding comprehension and people with learning difficulties. These groups have often been overlooked in the past; this is changing and will change significantly in the next 10 years.

Despite the proliferation of research works in this area, a well-founded software engineering approach specifically addressing the distribution of intelligence sources between the Edge and the Cloud is still missing. In this paper we propose some general criteria along with a coherent set of guidelines to follow in the design of distributed intelligence within CPCS, suitably exploiting Edge and Cloud paradigms to effectively enable data intelligence and accounting for both symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches to reasoning.

Defense has traditionally been one of the key drivers of S&T advancements due to large amount of funding it received particularly by national governments. A number of technologies have been developed for defense, found their civilian applications, and vice versa. Wherever the boost for change comes from, the nature of warfare has changed radically both due to S&T advancements and changing socioeconomic and geopolitical contexts. Despite of the barriers due to strict organizational culture, armies have adapted themselves into changing characteristics of warfare through new concepts and instruments. Among S&T developments, recent advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) bring enormous opportunities as well as challenges for defense. One of the recent phenomena emerged with the rapid development of ICTs is the Internet of Things (IoTs), which affects every aspect of life with a growing number of devices communicating with each other.

The heterogeneity of hardware sensors, communication protocols and data formats constitutes one of the main challenge toward the large-scale adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm on industrial environments. To this purpose, the W3C Web of Things (WoT) group is working on the definition of some reference standards intended to describe in a uniform way the software interfaces of IoT devices and services, and hence to achieve the full interoperability among different IoT components regardless of their implementation. At the same time, due also to the recent appearance of the WoT W3C draft, few testbed and real-world deployments of the W3C WoT architecture has been proposed so far in the literature. In this paper, we attempt to fill such gap by describing the realization of a WoT monitoring application of a generic indoor production site: the system is able to orchestrate the sensing operations from three heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We describe how the components of the W3C WoT architecture have been instantiated in our scenario.

To satisfy both the scalability and ultra-low delay requirements of computing capability on terminal devices, the new rising mobile edge computing (MEC) technology emerges as a promising paradigm in 5G communications. The basic thought of MEC is to offload cloud computing platform to the edge of mobile access network to enable the user equipment to offload computation tasks to the nodes at the edge of network, which is beneficial for 5G services to fulfill technical indicators such as ultra-low delay, ultra-high energy efficiency, and ultra-high reliability.

However, training simulation instructors currently rely on direct observation and radio-based audio communication methods to observe behaviors and evaluate interactions of trainees to provide feedback to trainees during debriefing sessions. Such human-driven evaluative methods, while valuable, lose fidelity of information for learning due to working memory limitations and the mind’s inability to capture all relevant behavioral information in realtime and to provide relevant detailed information that is easily interpretable to instructors. Thus, there is a need and the potential to explore alternative data collection and processing methods leveraging advanced wireless technologies to attempt to enhance the effectiveness of simulation training process for emergency response, to ultimately help save lives and better prepare our communities building emergency and disaster resilience.

Numerous insurance companies are clustered together to provide a standardized health status monitoring of clients. Since there is a large amount data generated by the system, we adopt Hadoop in the background to map the data effectively and to reduce it into a simpler format. We assimilate Sqoop tool to enable data transfer between Hadoop and RDBMS, in consort with Apache Hive for providing a database query interface to the Hadoop. By consuming the output from Hadoop MapReduce, a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier predicts the policyholder’s chances of developing some health problems. Ultimately, the resultant outcomes are presented on the user’s smartphones. The Apache Ranger framework interweaved with the Hadoop ecosystem aims to ensure data confidentiality.

Security and privacy are considered key issues in any real-world smart environment based on the IoT model. The security vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems create security threats that affect smart environment applications. Thus, there is a crucial need for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) designed for IoT environments to mitigate IoT-related security attacks that exploit some of these security vulnerabilities. Due to the limited computing and storage capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional IDSs may not be an option for IoT environments. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the latest IDSs designed for the IoT model, with a focus on the corresponding methods, features, and mechanisms. This article also provides deep insight into the IoT architecture, emerging security vulnerabilities, and their relation to the layers of the IoT architecture. This work demonstrates that despite previous studies regarding the design and implementation of IDSs for the IoT paradigm, developing efficient, reliable and robust IDSs for IoT-based smart environments is still a crucial task. Key considerations for the development of such IDSs are introduced as a future outlook at the end of this survey.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13677-018-0123-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

From a formal point of view, the employed intelligent sensor actuator systems (ISAS) constituting such intelligent systems combine three different technologies: control systems, distributed systems, and learning and reasoning. While each of the parent domains features tested and proven verification methods, simply combining the tasks unfortunately leads to a combinatorial explosion of complexity. This paper presents an overview and classification of currently employed techniques for handling ISAS in terms of: cyber-physical systems, intelligent autonomous robots, or intelligent agents. The article argues that each of the three classical perspectives misses one important characteristic of ISAS and proposes to combine the three for a full solution. The paper argues that in particular two mechanisms are promising: an intelligent environments perspective that verifies local safety and techniques for context-aware monitoring that allow a mobile system to leverage context-awareness to reduce complexity for self-monitoring tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40860-018-0070-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Within energy grids, Smart Home scenarios can be characterized by a unique combination of appliances and user preferences. To increase their impact, a scenario-specific selection of the best performing DR methods is necessary. As the user faces a multitude of heterogeneous DR methods to choose from, a complex decision problem is present. The primary goal of this study is to develop a decision support framework that can determine the best-performing DR methods. Building on literature analyses, expert workshops and expert interviews, we identify seven requirements, derive solution concepts addressing these requirements, and develop the framework by combining the concepts using a benchmarking process as a template. To demonstrate the framework’s applicability, we conduct a simulation study that uses artificial (simulated) data for seven types of households. Within this study, we employ four DR methods, assume changing appliances over time and cost minimization as primary objective. The study indicates, that by using the framework and thus by identifying and using the best DR method for each scenario, the users can achieve further cost benefits. The application of the framework allows practitioners to increase the efficiency of the DR method selection process and to further enhance DR-related benefits, such as cost minimization, load profile flattening, and peak load reduction.

These metrics select effective features from a traffic flow. However, in order to select robust features from the selected features, we proposed robust features selection algorithm.

Therefore, legacy systems that were previously operated as standalone now have contact points with the external networks. In this trend, security vulnerabilities from legacy ICT have been inherited by power control systems. Therefore, various security technologies are being researched and developed to cope with cyber vulnerabilities and threats. However, it is risky to apply novel security technologies that are not verified as secure, to power control systems, the availability of which must be guaranteed to provide electricity consistently. Thus, verifying the effectiveness and stability of new security technologies is necessary to apply the technologies to power control systems.

First, we propose PINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side channel attack revealing user PINs on an Android mobile phone. In this attack, once the user visits a website controlled by an attacker, the JavaScript code embedded in the web page starts listening to the motion and orientation sensor streams without needing any permission from the user. By analysing these streams, it infers the user’s PIN using an artificial neural network. Based on a test set of fifty 4-digit PINs, PINlogger.js is able to correctly identify PINs in the first attempt with a success rate of 74% which increases to 86 and 94% in the second and third attempts, respectively. The high success rates of stealing user PINs on mobile devices via JavaScript indicate a serious threat to user security. With the technical understanding of the information leakage caused by mobile phone sensors, we then study users’ perception of the risks associated with these sensors. We design user studies to measure the general familiarity with different sensors and their functionality, and to investigate how concerned users are about their PIN being discovered by an app that has access to all these sensors. Our studies show that there is significant disparity between the actual and perceived levels of threat with regard to the compromise of the user PIN. We confirm our results by interviewing our participants using two different approaches, within-subject and between-subject, and compare the results.

Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node’s bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city’s adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies . Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines.

Specifically, the approach proposes a number of network metrics for provenance data and applies established machine learning techniques over such metrics to build predictive models for some key properties of data. Applying this method to the provenance of real-world data from three different applications, we show that it can successfully identify the owners of provenance documents, assess the quality of crowdsourced data, and identify instructions from chat messages in an alternate-reality game with high levels of accuracy.

The combination of CIoT and CPS can greatly enhance the quality of people’s life. To this end, this article proposes CIoT-CPS that comprises of two main models: user activity cognitive model and image authentication model.The user activity cognitive model (UACM) is a machine-learning model to have the meaningful data. The image authentication model is to verify the authenticity of images captured by various devices, such as smart phones, digital cameras, and other camera-embedded portable devices. The authenticity of an image is breached when parts of images are assembled to produce a new image (known as a splicing forgery), or a part of an image is copied or pasted into another part of the same image (known as a copy-move forgery). In the proposed verification method, an opposite color local binary pattern (OC-LBP) texture descriptor is applied to a questioned image. The image is first decomposed into an RGB (red, green, blue) and a luminance and chroma color spaces. The OC-LBP measures the interrelation between pixels of different color components. The intensive computation involving six color components and a gray version is performed in the cloud, where a server can be dedicated to doing this job. The histograms of the OC-LBP are concatenated with weights to produce a final feature vector of the image. A support vector machine is applied as a classifier, which classifies the image as authentic or forged. Several experiments were performed to verify the suitability of those models or approaches. The proposed approaches show a good accuracy compared to other competing approaches.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-017-0928-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To this end, an extensive search was conducted to find articles dealing with (a) telemedicine, (b) triage, (c) priority and (d) sensor; (e) comprehensively review related applications and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were checked for articles on triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the type of telemedicine technology explored. A total of 150 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category includes reviews and surveys of triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine. The second category includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. Tier 1 represents the users. Sensors acquire the vital signs of the users and send them to Tier 2, which is the personal gateway that uses local area network protocols or wireless body area network. Medical data are sent from Tier 2 to Tier 3, which is the healthcare provider in medical institutes. Then, the motivation for using triage and priority-based sensor technology in telemedicine, the issues related to the obstruction of its application and the development and utilisation of telemedicine are examined on the basis of the findings presented in the literature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10916-018-0943-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The presented work has the aim to address this need by proposing an innovative crowdsourcing-based game that engages citizens in validating disagreements between land cover datasets.

As water heating mostly relies on oil, gas, and electricity, hot water use has been identified as an important target of many carbon reduction programs. We propose and describe a system that—comparable to non-intrusive load monitoring for electricity—disaggregates water extractions from a central metering device. The system can be used to provide consumption feedback, feed information into energy management systems, and can help to identify excessive water and energy use. The system relies on event-detection techniques and adapted Random Forest classifiers. We have tested and validated the system in two households over four months. The system was able to detect 85% of the extraction events which we then classify (“Dishwasher”, “Shower”, “Tap”, “Toilet”, and “Washing machine”).

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. In addition, since the area of smart sustainable cities is not a specific direction of research, it does not have a unitary framework in terms of a uniform set of concepts and theories. Indeed, it represents multiple, diverse research directions and thus various inquiry approaches, including theoretical, applied theoretical, exploratory, empirical, and futuristic. These may be analytically quite diverse. The approach to this scholarly endeavor is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to assess, advance, and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities of the future.” This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant concepts, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this chapter endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental concepts and theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. This chapter provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high integration, fusion, and applicability potential in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of them is to consider it as leveraging the wireless and wired Internet to streamline the operation of city-wide infrastructures to maximize their operational efficiencies and offer new services to the citizens. Many existing or ongoing smart city realizations follow this interpretation. Another more futuristic interpretation is to consider it as a large-scale context-sensitive computing infrastructure that hosts heterogeneous programs and enables the programs to interact with each other in a variety of different ways. In this chapter, we pursue such a futuristic interpretation. We are proposing a computing model for smart cities that brings together cloud computing, fogs, and mobiles to support intelligent context-sensitive computing. Our computing model has two components. The first component is a hierarchical abstract machine that spans the cloud, fogs, and devices, which can scale from a single device to many thousands of machines. The second component is an implicit learning module that observes selected data within the abstract machine to learn their characteristics. Because the implicit learning module can provide predictions based on the data in a context-sensitive manner, in certain scenarios applications can get by without explicitly incorporating machine learning into their design. In this chapter, we motivate the need for such an intelligent context-sensitive model, describe the components of the model, and present some early results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-97271-8_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This has been boosted by the new digital transition in ICT. Driving such transition predominantly are big data analytics and context-aware computing and their increasing amalgamation within a number of urban domains, especially as their functionality involve more or less the same core enabling technologies, namely sensing devices, cloud computing infrastructures, data processing platforms, middleware architectures, and wireless networks. Topical studies tend to only pass reference to such technologies or to largely focus on one particular technology as part of big data and context-aware ecosystems in the realm of smart cities. Moreover, empirical research on the topic, with some exceptions, is generally limited to case studies without the use of any common conceptual frameworks. In addition, relatively little attention has been given to the integration of big data analytics and context-aware computing as advanced forms of ICT in the context of smart sustainable cities. This endeavor is a first attempt to address these two major strands of ICT of the new wave of computing in relation to the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and distilling the core enabling technologies of big data analytics and context-aware computing as ecosystems in relevance to smart sustainable cities, as well as to illustrate the key computational and analytical techniques and processes associated with the functioning of such ecosystems. In doing so, we develop, elucidate, and evaluate the most relevant frameworks pertaining to big data analytics and context-aware computing in the context of smart sustainable cities, bringing together research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level to stimulate new ways of investigating their role in advancing urban sustainability. In terms of originality, a review and synthesis of the technical literature have not been undertaken to date in the urban literature, and in doing so, we provide a basis for urban researchers to draw on a set of conceptual frameworks in future research. The proposed frameworks, which can be replicated and tested in empirical research, will add additional depth and rigor to studies in the field. We argue that big data analytics and context-aware computing are prerequisite technologies for the functioning of smart sustainable cities of the future, as their effects reinforce one another as to their efforts for bringing a whole new dimension to the operating and organizing processes of urban life in terms of employing a wide variety of big data and context-aware applications for advancing sustainability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The chapter also gives a number of examples of how big data and IoT is presently being used in various cities. Since the impact on sustainability in smart cities is presently minimal, we also look at the more advanced use of big data in other sectors.

Indeed, there has recently been much enthusiasm about the immense possibilities created by the data deluge and its new sources to better operate, manage, and plan cities to improve their contribution to the goals of sustainable development as a result of thinking about and understanding sustainability problems in a data-analytic fashion. This data deluge is increasingly enriching and reshaping our experiences of how such cities can be advanced. Big data analytics is indeed offering many new opportunities for well-informed decision-making and enhanced insights with respect to our knowledge of how fast and best to improve urban sustainability. This unprecedented shift has been brought up by data science, an interdisciplinary field which involves scientific systems, processes, and methods used to extract useful knowledge from data in structured or unstructured forms. Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases as processes are by far the most widely used techniques for extracting useful knowledge from colossal datasets for enhanced decision-making and insights in relation predominantly to business intelligence. However, in city-related academic and scientific research, it is argued that “small data” studies—questionnaire surveys, focus groups, case studies, participatory observations, audits, interviews, content analyses, and ethnographies—are associated with high cost, infrequent periodicity, quick obsolescence, reflexivity, incompleteness, and inaccuracy, i.e., capture a relatively limited sample of data that are tightly focused, time and space specific, restricted in scope and scale, and relatively expensive to generate and analyze, to provide additional depth and insight with respect to urban phenomena. Accordingly, much of our knowledge of urban sustainability has been gleaned from studies that are characterized by data scarcity. The potential of big data lies in transforming the knowledge of smart sustainable cities through the creation of a data deluge that seeks to provide much more sophisticated, wider scale, finer grained, real-time understanding, and control of various aspects of urbanity. Therefore, this chapter aims to synthesize, illustrate, and discuss a systematic framework for urban (sustainability) analytics based on Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) in response to the emerging wave of city analytics in the context of smart sustainable cities. This framework, which can be tested and used in empirical applications in the city domain, has an innovative potential to advance urban analytics by providing a novel way of thinking data-analytically about urban sustainability problems. It provides fertile insights into how to conduct “big data” studies in the field of urban sustainability. The intent is to enable well-informed or knowledge-driven decision-making and enhanced insights in relation to diverse urban domains with regard to operations, functions, strategies, designs, practices, and policies for increasing the contribution of smart sustainable cities to the goals of sustainable development. This chapter can serve to bring together city analysts, data scientists, urban planners and scholars, and ICT experts on common ground in their endeavor to transform and advance the knowledge of smart sustainable cities in terms of sustainability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The globally rapid urbanization is proposing various inevitable issues, one of which is smart and efficient surveillance in urban areas. With ubiquitously deployed smart sensors, city mobility can be recorded all the time resulting in tons of urban data in every second. For smart city surveillance Smart city surveillance , identifying anomaly changes is always of high priority since changes in normal urban patterns may lead to remarkable events or even disasters. However, just like finding a needle in the sea, it is difficult for the surveillance operators to obtain meaningful information from the collected big urban data. Moreover, changes especially in emergent situations require quick decision-making with rather low latency tolerance to prevent a big loss. Therefore, all the issues are propelling researchers to seek new computing paradigms other than cloud computing Cloud Computing which is powerful but suffers relatively high latency and bandwidth overconsumption.

An important means to such adaptability is through the use of simulation models which can be leveraged for dynamic decision support. To provide high quality decision support, one can use simulations in an optimization loop to derive the best values of system parameters for a given system state particularly when the system has too many parameters and traditional means to optimize the outcomes are intractable. To that end, simulation-based optimization methods have emerged to enable optimization in the context of complex, black-box simulations thereby obviating the need for specific and accurate model information, such as gradient computation. An important challenge in using simulation-based optimization is optimizing the decision parameters. However, to ensure scalability and real-time decision support, one must be able to rapidly deploy simulation-based optimization in a way that makes the best use of available computing resources given the time and budget constraints. To address these needs, we propose a cloud-based framework for simulation-based optimization as a service (SBOaaS) to enable a flexible and highly parallelizable dynamic decision support for such environments. We illustrate the framework by using it to design a dynamic traffic light control system through simulation-based optimizations using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulation model that adjusts to the observed vehicle flow.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-95504-9_26,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The IoT is an internetworking of connecting and integrating several types of devices and technologies that comprising sensors, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), cloud computing, the Internet, smart grids, and vehicle networks, and many other devices and new technologies. The IoT becomes a subject for illegal and criminals activities. Cyber criminals and terrorists are highly qualified persons in the computer, network, digital systems and new technologies. An enormous amount of data is gathered about criminals and their behavior from different data sources over the Internet can be processed using data science methods to monitor and trace them in real-time and online. The massive amount of data needs new fast and efficient processing tools and techniques for data extracting and analyzing in less period of time. Data science methods can be used for this purpose to investigate and detect a different type of severe attacks and intrusions.

Disaster management plays a key role in reducing the human and economic losses. In our earlier work, we have developed a disaster management system that uses VANET, cloud computing, and simulations to devise city evacuation strategies. In this paper, we extend our earlier work by using deep learning to predict urban traffic behavior. Moreover, we use GPUs to deal with compute intensive nature of deep learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply deep learning approach in disaster management. We use real-world open road traffic within a city available through the UK Department for Transport.

Marking and fueling this change predominately is the increasing use and application of big data and data-driven decision-making in urban analytics and planning to advance the contribution of cities to sustainability. This unprecedented shift has been instigated by the recent advances in data science and its becoming a more accessible tool to advocacy groups, more extensive data and their new sources being able to potentially allow key stakeholders to see and respond to various urban factors (mobility, transport, energy, environment, public health care, education, etc.) in real time, coupled with citizens emitting rich spatiotemporal data to an increasing extent through the use of various technologies. We refer to big data with respect to their humongous size and wide variety but pay particular attention to urban data, i.e., data invariably tagged with spatial and temporal labels; largely streamed from diverse sensory sources and stored in databases; generated routinely, automatically, and sporadically; and merged and coalesced in data warehouses for use at the citywide scale. This epitomizes a sea change in the data that we generate about urban systems as to what happens and where, when, how, and why in the urban environment. This is opening entirely new windows of opportunity for the application of analytical solutions and data-driven decision-making approaches into urban planning in terms of improving the performance of, and contribution to, the goals of sustainable development under what is termed smart sustainable cities. This chapter explores the real potential of big data and data-driven decision-making for revolutionizing or transforming the process of planning for the purpose of achieving the goals of sustainable development in the context of smart sustainable cities, focusing on different dimensions and functions of planning as well as their synergy and integration. We argue that the increasing proliferation and availability of urban data, coupled with the continuous integration of new and more extensive sources of such data as well as the evolving development of big data technologies, are increasingly enabling novel analytical solutions for, or sophisticated engineering approaches into, advancing the process of sustainable urban development, in addition to seamlessly integrating long-term strategic planning with short-term thinking about how cities can function and be managed in the context of sustainability. In addition, we believe that big data innovations entail how new data-driven transformations are facilitated and applied as well as diffused throughout urban systems, rather than simply denoting a significant growth in volume and variety of urban data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this chapter, we have reasoned why IoT needs Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) (AI). The intelligent IoT that we discuss here, is termed as the Cognitive IoT (CIoT) Cognitive IoT (CIoT) . Cognitive IoT uses a new computing paradigm called Cognitive Computing Cognitive computing , often popularly dubbed as the third era of computing. Cognitive Computing will make IoT more sophisticated, more intelligent, and more interactive Interactive . This chapter essentially focuses on the convergence of IoT with Cognitive AI Cognitive AI . In addition to introducing a preliminary idea of Cognitive Computing, the chapter discusses several aspects of CIoT. It explains how Cognitive Computing has been used in IoT through different forms such as Cognitive Network Cognitive network , Cognitive Devices Cognitive devices , and Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics . The desirable properties of the CIoT are mentioned. A special discussion is presented on how CIoT has taken automation to a new level. Realizing CIoT is not straightforward for the reason that it is a complex system and is quite different from other computing systems we have been familiar with. The implementation challenges along with the societal and ethical apprehensions of CIoT have been identified and discussed in detail. The business world is showing great interest in IoT and subsequently in CIoT. Considering that, we have highlighted the business values of CIoT and some prospective application areas along with a few prominent use cases.

The complete discovery of these environments aiming to take full control over them is a “mission-impossible”, however, still in our common agenda. People intend to make their living spaces smarter utilizing innovations from the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as very dynamic, autonomous and intelligent things capable to discover and control large areas are becoming important “inhabitants” within existing and future smart cities. Our concern in this paper is to challenge the potential of UAVs in situations, which are evolving fast in a way unseen before, e.g., emergency situations. To address such challenges, UAVs have to be “intelligent” enough to be capable to autonomously and in near real-time evaluate the situation and its dynamics. Then, they have to discover their own missions and set-up suitable own configurations to perform it. This configuration is the result of flexible plans which are created in mutual collaboration. Finally, the UAVs execute the plans and learn from the new experiences for future reuse. However, if to take into account also the Big Data challenge, which is naturally associated with the smart cities, UAVs must be also “wise” in a sense that the process of making autonomous and responsible real-time decisions must include continuous search for a compromise between efficiency (acceptable time frame to get the decision and reasonable resources spent for that) and effectiveness (processing as much of important input information as possible and to improve the quality of the decisions). To address such a “skill” we propose to perform the required computations using Cloud Computing enhanced with Semantic Web technologies and potential tools (“agile” deep learning) for compromising, such as, e.g., focusing, filtering, forgetting, contextualizing, compressing and connecting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-54490-8_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By 2030 cities will account for 60% of the world’s population. Cities with populations of ten million or more are called megacities. The problems found in megacities and other urban environments – explosive growth rates, vast and growing income disparity, and a security environment that is increasingly attractive to the politically dispossessed – present great challenges to national and international security. Therefore, monitoring these cities will become increasingly important to provide decision makers with effective predictors of looming instability. The urban environment is becoming increasingly more connected and complex. In the coming decades, we will be surrounded by billions of sensors, devices and machines, the Internet of Things (IoT). Cities and urban areas that benefit from the IoT are commonly referred to as Smart Cities. Based on the rise of IoT adoption around the world, future intelligence techniques for megacities will rely, in part, on Smart City technologies. To this end, there is a need for a common framework that captures military operations, urban operations, emergency response operations, and city behavior. By creating such a framework, the sharing of information and common understanding of instabilities in megacities can be recognized and communicated across different operational needs. With a common intelligence framework, a variety of technologies - data analytics, sensor fusion, augmented reality, cyber security, 3D tracking, and predictive modeling - can be developed to provide situational awareness on the many dimensions of megacities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75232-7_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such systems employ low-power embedded computers to provide local computation close to clients or cloud. The discussed architectures cover applications in medical, healthcare, wellness and fitness monitoring, geo-information processing, mineral resource management, etc. Cloud computing can get assistance by transferring some of the processing and decision making to the edge either close to client layer or cloud backend. Fog of Things refers to an amalgamation of multiple fog nodes that could communicate with each other with the Internet of Things. The clouds act as the final destination for heavy-weight processing, long-term storage and analysis. We propose application-specific architectures GeoFog and Fog2Fog that are flexible and user-orientated. The fog devices act as intermediate intelligent nodes in such systems where these could decide if further processing is required or not. The preliminary data analysis, signal filtering, data cleaning, feature extraction could be implemented on edge computer leading to a reduction of computational load in the cloud. In several practical cases, such as tele healthcare of patients with Parkinson’s disease, edge computing may decide not to proceed for data transmission to cloud (Barik et al., in 5th IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing 2017, IEEE, 2017) [ 4 ].

This is manifested in a variety of ways to think of and define the underlying many subsystems as connected and joined together by a web of relationships that interact to produce collective behavior that cannot easily be explained in terms of interactions between the individual constituent elements. As such, they involve special conundrums, intractable problems, and complex challenges pertaining to sustainability and urbanization. It follows that to deal with such systems requires newfangled ways founded on more innovative solutions and sophisticated methods with respect to how cities can be monitored, understood, managed, planned, and developed. This necessitates leveraging the advance and prevalence of ICT in the transition toward the needed sustainable urban development in an increasingly urbanized and computerized world. Importantly, smart sustainable cities require advanced thinking approaches to be well understood and illuminated so as to enable more effective actions necessary for enhancing their functioning and adaptation in ways that guide their development toward sustainability. The aim of this chapter is twofold. Grounded in systems thinking and complexity science as theoretic approaches, this chapter endeavors to systematically explore the key underlying structures, behavioral patterns, conditions, relationships, and interactions pertaining to smart sustainable cities as complex systems, and to elucidate the related principles in terms of methods, mechanisms, and goals. The intent of offering the knowledge to describe and analyze such systems accordingly is to surface noteworthy relationships as well as their implications for sustainability so as to provoke thought, foster deeper understanding, and create fertile insights, with the primary purpose of making visible possible places for actions that improve the contribution of smart sustainable cities to the goals of sustainable development. This can be accomplished by means of devising powerful urban intelligence functions and robust urban simulation models for strategic decision-making based on big data analytics in conjunction with urban design concepts and planning principles of sustainability. Accordingly, this chapter also discusses the potential of big data analytics and related urban intelligence functions and urban simulation models for, and the role of urban design in, catalyzing and advancing the strategic process of sustainable development by proposing innovative approaches and solutions for monitoring, managing, planning, and designing smart sustainable cities of the future. The main argument is that the systems thinking and complexity science are integral to the understanding of smart sustainable cities, which is a moving target in that they are becoming more complex through the very technologies being used to understand them. Moreover, advanced ICT is founded on the application of complexity theory to urban problems in terms of tracking the changing dynamics, disentangling the intractable problems, and tackling the challenges pertaining to urban systems, which are in and of themselves becoming ever more complex. As high-performance computers have become an indispensable source of information, complex systems cannot be understood and studied without the use of computers and big data analytics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The population of independently living senior citizens has also become significant. This has led to an active research focus in geriatric wellness. Apart from the usual physical and cognitive decline that proceeds with age, there are much softer aspects like dignity and ability to live independently (age-in-place). If we monitor the subject all the time by instrumenting them heavily, technology can possibly predict and prevent many abnormal situations. However, this curbs the idea of independent living. Hence, while instrumenting and monitoring is an important paradigm in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), the need for the underlying technology to be non-intrusive or as natural as possible is also pressing. For example, passive infrared (PIR) sensors are quite effective and ubiquitous in detecting presence and movement. In this paper we investigate the opportunities in this sliding balance of intrusiveness versus wellness. We explore ubiquitous and pervasive monitoring to make useful inferences in the subject’s activities of daily living (ADL). To this end, we evaluate different type of commercially available sensors such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect $$^\mathrm{TM}$$ TM , video cameras and smart watches, which will augment the PIR sensors at home. Each sensor will allow the elderly to be monitored for specific wellness parameters. We propose a generic framework with algorithms developed in-house, highlighting the use of the Kinect for computing fall-risk through single limb stand (SLS) and postural stability, smart watches to detect multiple activities in an energy efficient manner using in-built sensors, and, finally, computer-vision based methods using video cameras to detect the liveliness of human beings by computing the micro motions of the body during sleep. These findings can be used for both early risk assessment and cognitive training of an individual.

However, the electricity market is complex with highly volatile spot prices, and high price events might happen during peak time periods when energy demand significantly increases, leading to the decision of the retail price a challenging task. Understanding consumer price index, a price indicator that is associated with electricity consumption of customers helps energy retailers make critical decisions on pricing strategy. In this work, we apply dynamic gradient boosting model, namely CatBoost, to classify customers into different groups according to their price indices. To benchmark our results, we compare the performance of CatBoost with other baselines, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our experimental results proved that CatBoost outperformed other algorithms due to its effective overfitting detector and categorical encoding techniques. Besides, the area under the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), often known as AUC, is used as a standard measure metric to evaluate and compare between classifiers. Hence, CatBoost gained the lowest difference score of 0.02 between train AUC and test AUC scores that successfully competed other models.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02925-8_33,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recent years have seen a new wave of “Data Science”, “big data” and “smart cities” sweeping though the Transport sector.

In the first section, it is shown that applications introduce a variety of practical constraints which elicit new research topics in the field: clarifying the definition of sound events, thus suggesting interest for the explicit modeling of temporal patterns and interruption; running and evaluating AER in 24/7 sound detection setups, which suggests to recast the problem as open-set recognition; and running AER applications on consumer devices with limited audio quality and computational power, thus triggering interest for scalability and robustness. The second section explores the definition of user experience for AER. After reporting field observations about the ways in which system errors affect user experience, it is proposed to introduce opinion scoring into AER evaluation methodology. Then, the link between standard AER performance metrics and subjective user experience metrics is being explored, and attention is being drawn to the fact that F-score metrics actually mash up the objective evaluation of acoustic discrimination with the subjective choice of an application-dependent operation point. Solutions to the separation of discrimination and calibration in system evaluation are introduced, thus allowing the more explicit separation of acoustic modeling optimization from that of application-dependent user experience. Finally, the last section analyses the ethical and legal issues involved in deploying AER systems which are “listening” at all times into the users’ private space. A review of the key notions underpinning European data and privacy protection laws, questioning if and when these apply to audio data, suggests a set of guidelines which summarize into empowering users to consent by fully informing them about the use of their data, as well as taking reasonable information security measures to protect users’ personal data.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63450-0_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The literature studies showed that 30% of the traffic congestion, unnecessary fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are caused by searching for the parking spaces.

It extracts the multiple correlation among VMs based on its past workload trace and predicts their future workload with high accuracy. The VM workload prediction helps the decision makers for capacity planning and to apply the suitable VM placement and migration technique with a more robust scaling decision.

The delegation of sensing tasks to a wide public offers multiple opportunities from the perspectives of applications, end users, and participants. However, the introduction of volunteers in the sensing loop also introduces some risks for these stakeholders. In this chapter, we hence provide an overview of existing applications and detail both the opportunities and risks raised by the contributions of volunteers to the sensing process.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98161-1_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, digit ratios are measured manually. This study proposes an automatic digit ratio measurement approach that can be used in the context of smart city healthcare and business applications. Smart city healthcare needs to be founded on the principles of self-service and independence. The proposed approach assumes that an image of the hands of a user is acquired using some imaging device. First, the hands are separated from the background. Next, the hand outline is traced. The hand outlines are used to identify points of interest that are used to measure the finger lengths and digit ratios. Experimental results are promising, but further research is needed before the approach can be deployed in real-world settings.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-1741-4_5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This focus provides an opportunity to compare technologies where privacy seals have purchase against those that do not, further refining the model of an effective privacy seal. It examines the privacy and data protection issues surrounding smart homes, smart cars, wearables and drones, and evaluates the potential for deploying privacy and data protection seals in these contexts by deploying design fictions. From these thought experiments, it becomes apparent that in addition to the general requirements of a privacy seal, there also needs to be strong alignment between the technology, (including its physical design, logical design, and level of generativity) and its social context of use. By its interconnected nature, IoT fundamentally disrupts our expectations around objects (things) and information flows. Seals might act as part of the mechanisms of re-transcribing such expectations. Designing a workable seal therefore means understanding information norms, and expectations, but also desired states of information flow in particular contexts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-6265-228-6_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This implies that the processes need to be managed more explicitly in an increasingly real-time fashion, with ample attention to individual process cases. To support this kind of processes, no single existing technology class suffices. Therefore, we propose to integrate technologies from the areas of business process management (BPM - to manage the processes), internet of things (IoT - to sense and actuate the physical objects) and distributed analytics (DA - to take the right decisions at the right place in real-time) into a trinity.

This paper more specifically concentrates on urban participatory mobile distributed systems where people get involved in producing new knowledge about the urban environment. Service-oriented and cloud computing are evident baseline technologies for the target mobile distributed systems. Service orientation provides the abstraction to deal with the assembly of the relevant heterogeneous component systems. The cloud provides the infrastructure to deal with the gathering and analyses of the observations coming from the sensing infrastructure, including from people. However, cloud-based centralized solutions come at a price, regarding both resource consumption and privacy risk. Further, the high heterogeneity of the participating nodes results in diverse levels of sensing accuracy.

The same practice also enables the compressed code to carry semantic information of the image during its storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose a Deep Semantic Image Compression (DeepSIC) model to achieve this goal and put forward two novel architectures that aim to reconstruct the compressed image and generate corresponding semantic representations at the same time by a single end-to-end optimized network. The first architecture performs semantic analysis in the encoding process by reserving a portion of the bits from the compressed code to store the semantic representations. The second performs semantic analysis in the decoding step with the feature maps that are embedded in the compressed code. In both architectures, the feature maps are shared by the compression and the semantic analytics modules. Experiments over benchmarking datasets show promising performance of the proposed compression model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-04167-0_9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents the design and implementation of a multipurpose, multidiscipline digital platform that manages, preserves and disseminates tangible and intangible cultural heritage information, in a trustworthy manner, appropriate for the everyday use in smart city digital environments. Platform’s trustworthiness is mainly ensured by applying specific authorization mechanisms based on an extended role-based access control scheme. The platform integrates a mobile services module that can host and support smartphone applications for the direct collection, digitization and dissemination of cultural heritage content. Moreover, we make an attempt to address various stakeholders who benefit from such a platform. In this direction we have designed and implemented a series of real life usage scenarios. The proposed platform is evaluated against other online digital platforms that host cultural heritage content. Evaluation results suggest that the presented platform could become a participatory system that targets not only experts and artists, but also amateurs and enthusiasts of cultural heritage.

This has been boosted by the new digital transition in ICT. Driving such transition predominantly are big data analytics and context-aware computing and their increasing amalgamation within a number of urban domains, especially as their functionality involve more or less the same core enabling technologies, namely sensing devices, cloud computing infrastructures, data processing platforms, middleware architectures, and wireless networks. Topical studies tend to only pass reference to such technologies or to largely focus on one particular technology as part of big data and context-aware ecosystems in the realm of smart cities. Moreover, empirical research on the topic, with some exceptions, is generally limited to case studies without the use of any common conceptual frameworks. In addition, relatively little attention has been given to the integration of big data analytics and context-aware computing as advanced forms of ICT in the context of smart sustainable cities. This endeavor is a first attempt to address these two major strands of ICT of the new wave of computing in relation to the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and distilling the core enabling technologies of big data analytics and context-aware computing as ecosystems in relevance to smart sustainable cities, as well as to illustrate the key computational and analytical techniques and processes associated with the functioning of such ecosystems. In doing so, we develop, elucidate, and evaluate the most relevant frameworks pertaining to big data analytics and context-aware computing in the context of smart sustainable cities, bringing together research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level to stimulate new ways of investigating their role in advancing urban sustainability. In terms of originality, a review and synthesis of the technical literature has not been undertaken to date in the urban literature, and in doing so, we provide a basis for urban researchers to draw on a set of conceptual frameworks in future research. The proposed frameworks, which can be replicated and tested in empirical research, will add additional depth and rigor to studies in the field. In addition to reviewing the important works, we highlight important applications as well as challenges and open issues. We argue that big data analytics and context-aware computing are prerequisite technologies for the functioning of smart sustainable cities of the future, as their effects reinforce one another as to their efforts for bringing a whole new dimension to the operating and organizing processes of urban life in terms of employing a wide variety of big data and context-aware applications for advancing sustainability.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-017-0091-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Migration contributes to an increase in consumption of network resources which leads to longer migration times and ultimately has a detrimental effect on the performance of a cloud computing system.

In this paper, we propose an autonomous network aware live migration strategy that observes the current demand level of a network and performs appropriate actions based on what it is experiencing. The Artificial Intelligence technique known as Reinforcement Learning acts as a decision support system, enabling an agent to learn optimal scheduling times for live migration while analysing current network traffic demand.

One of the most important Internet of Things enabled scenarios is the smart city, this application having a direct impact on multiple social areas: smart lighting, smart roads, noise urban maps and many others. Smart city objects will interact with both humans and machines, implementing multiple communication protocols. Taking this into consideration, integrating smart city objects with social networks is a logical step, even though this idea implies multiple security issues and innovative big data processing systems. Social networks represent a platform where both machines and humans can exchange messages, being an information source and sink for the smart city objects. This paper presents a security architecture where social networks enable an adaptive sensing-as-a-service system. Smart city objects, which need additional information beside the one obtained from the sensors, collect it from the most trusted nodes on the social network.

Protocols for dynamic location referencing like e.g. OpenLR or AGORA-C tackle the problem of accurately matching locations between dissimilar digital maps. They are map-agnostic and aim at limiting the amount of descriptive data to reduce bandwidth. However, there are applications for which the weaker requirement of map-independence is completely adequate, and for some there are even no restrictions in bandwidth (e.g. in the EC-funded project ROSATTE, and in the DLR projects MobiLind and KeepMoving), and with relaxed constraints it is possible to learn from methods in similar areas like road network matching and map conflation, in order to achieve a more accurate solution. Following this path, this paper presents a map-independent approach developed in the ongoing DLR project I.MoVe, which can be combined with a bandwidth-efficient dynamic location referencing method like e.g. OpenLR to target applications with bandwidth restrictions. Methods The proposed new approach works line-oriented and is guided by a measure of geometric dissimilarity. It is a top-down approach, recursively splitting up the source route into parts, thereby following a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the problem until it can be solved trivially. Results It is currently capable of mapping closed line locations (i.e. circular routes, representing either the boundaries of areas or the tours of e.g. delivery trucks) from a TeleAtlas map to a NAVTEQ map on-the-fly with a success rate of 97.5% (OpenLR: only 82.5%), and also capable of mapping short line locations (i.e. linear routes) on-the-fly between the same maps, with a success rate of 99.7% (OpenLR: 91.9% Conclusion In conclusion, the new approach to match linear or circular routes between two dissimilar maps is highly accurate and map-independent, but access to both involved maps is required. The approach can also be combined with a bandwidth-efficient dynamic location referencing method like e.g. OpenLR to obtain a compact format before the descriptive data is transmitted.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12544-017-0254-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The tasks of tracking human over camera networks are not only inherently challenging due to changing human appearance, but also have enormous potentials for a wide range of practical applications, ranging from security surveillance to retail and health care. This review paper surveys the most widely used techniques and recent advances for human tracking over camera networks. Two important functional modules for the human tracking over camera networks are addressed, including human tracking within a camera and human tracking across non-overlapping cameras.

This renders mobility inside cities problematic, since it is often associated with large waste of time in traffic congestions, environmental pollution and accidents. Cities struggle to invent and deploy continuously evolving, “smart” solutions in the domain of urban mobility, so as to improve the overall quality of life therein. In this context, the paper discusses on the fundamental challenges that cities face when trying to become smarter, focusing on the particular area of mobility-as-a-service. Moreover, the paper describes a specific framework that leverages on 5G mobile communication infrastructures, in order to increase the effectiveness of vehicular communications and the relevant mobility services and applications offered in urban environments.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12530-016-9166-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, there is a high demand for the development of technology-based personalized solutions to guide and encourage patients towards performing online rehabilitation program that can help them live independently at home. This paper introduces an innovative e-health framework that develops adaptive serious games for people with hand disabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a patient-adaptive environment for the gamification of hand therapies in order to facilitate and encourage rehabilitation issues. Theoretical foundations (i.e., therapy and patient models) and algorithms to match therapy-based hand gestures to navigational movements in 3D space within the serious game environment have been developed. A novel game generation module is introduced, which translates those movements into a 3D therapy-driven route on a real-world map and with different levels of difficulty based on the patient profile and capabilities. In order to enrich the user navigation experience, a 3D spatio-temporal validation region is also generated, which tracks and adjusts the patient movements throughout the session. The gaming environment also creates and adds semantics to different types of attractive and repellent objects in space depending on the difficulty level of the game. Relevant benchmarks to assess the patient interaction with the environment along with a usability and performance testing of our framework are introduced to ensure quantitative as well as qualitative improvements. Trial tests in one disability center were conducted with a total number of five subjects, having hand motor controls problems, who used our gamified physiotherapy solution to help us in measuring the usability and users’ satisfaction levels. The obtained results and feedback from therapists and patients are very encouraging.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-017-9191-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

From this point, this paper proposes a content-based deep communication control approach to guarantee its security. Based on the layer architecture, this approach analyzes the interactive content in depth according to different industrial communication protocols, and implements the access control between two distinct enclaves. For OPC Classic, we acquire the dynamic port provided by OPC server, and open a new connection belonging to this port; for Modbus/TCP, we not only analyze the ordinary function codes and addresses, but also check the register or coil values by using the multi-bit Trie-tree matching algorithm. Besides, the white-listing strategy is introduced to satisfy the special requirements of industrial communication. Our experiment results show that, on the one hand the proposed approach provides OPC and Modbus/TCP defenses in depth; on the other hand it has less than 1 ms forwarding latency and 0 packet loss rate when the rule number reaches 200, and all these meet the availability requirements in the networked control system. In particular, this approach has been successfully applied in several real-world petrochemical control systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11235-016-0223-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

More flexible and dynamic use of the 3.5 GHz spectrum aims to increase the efficiency of spectrum use in delivering fast growing and converging mobile broadband and media services while paving the way to innovations in technology and business models. In this paper, we focus on key stakeholders’ capability to deal with combined internal and external resources and capabilities in doing business, referred to as dynamic capability. Spectrum sharing, introducing a rapid change in the technology and business environments, requires dynamic capabilities from spectrum offering, spectrum utilization, and spectrum management perspectives. We focus on defining key CBRS functional domains and identifying their key antecedents, elements, and outcomes. The analysis highlights the key role of the regulator in creating a sharing framework with incentives for all the key stakeholders, with different operational and business requirements, and enabling scaling ecosystem. Increased system dynamics in spectrum sharing will introduce a need for big data analytics, near real time network management capabilities and low cost third tier general authorized access radios, leveraging dominant technology ecosystems. This study provides viewpoints for stakeholders about additional ingredients and actions, which may be relevant to promote spectrum sharing in the form of the CBRS.

There has been development of a variety of health-related smartphone applications. Currently, however, there are few to none applications based on nurses’ historical or behavioral preferences. Mobile application development for the health care sector requires extensive attention to security, reliability, and accuracy. In nursing applications, the users are often required to navigate in hospital environments, select patients to support, read the patient history and set action points to assist the patient during their shift. Finally, they have to report their performance on patient related activities and other relevant information before they leave for the day. In a working day, a nurse often visits different locations such as the patient’s room, different laboratories, and offices for filling reports. There is still a limited capability to access context relevant information on a smartphone with minimal recourse such as Wi-Fi triangulation. The Wi-Fi triangulation signals fluctuate significantly for indoor location positioning. Therefore, providing relevant location based services to a mobile subscriber has become challenging. This paper addresses this gap by applying machine learning and behavior analysis to anticipate the potential location of the nurse and provide the required services. The application concept was already presented at the IMCOM 2015 conference. This paper focuses on the process to ascertain a user’s context, the process of analyzing and predicting user behavior, and finally, the process of displaying the information through a dynamically generated UI.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-016-0384-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We instantiate the proposed system using multi-model data collected from two social networks, namely Twitter and Instagram, which can provide instant geo-tagged data. Data analysis is performed to detect human affections from user uploaded content. The information revealed from the collected social data can be visualized at multiple dimensions through a well-designed Web application. This allows users to easily sense changes in human affective status and identify the underlying reasons. This offers priceless opportunities to improve the decision making in many critical tasks using the detected attitudes in the social messages, such as promotion strategy for companies or new policy making for the government.

In the area of experimentation, two trends can be observed. First, there is a shift from lab-based, controlled experiments to experimenting “in the wild”: researchers tend to augment the users’ natural environments and observe how people integrate a new solution into their everyday lives. Second, when a substantial investment in setting up an experimentation infrastructure has been made, it makes sense to open it to a wide community of researchers; the concept of Experimentation-as-a-Service (EaaS) is emerging along these lines. SmartCampus, an IoT testbed developed at the University of Surrey, fits the both trends very well. It involves real users in a natural setting, as IoT devices are deployed in the users’ offices. Further, several user-centric experiments conducted in the SmartCampus were driven by external researchers, i.e., people who do not belong to the team that developed the testbed. In this paper we report on lessons learned from such IoT experiments. After a brief overview of SmartCampus and the experiments themselves, we offer a simple experiment stakeholder model, which identifies key actors and interfaces between them. We then focus on issues related to the external experimenters who take advantage of the experimentation “service.” That focus is motivated by our realization that EaaS, while attractive in principle, gives rise to a number of non-trivial challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-014-2223-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, these two goals are often conflicting because convenient abstraction usually needs more computing resources. Thus, the cloud OS has its own characteristics of resource management and task scheduling for supporting various kinds of cloud applications. The evolution of cloud OS is in fact driven by these two often conflicting goals and finding the right tradeoff between them makes each phase of the evolution happen. In this paper, we have investigated the ways of cloud OS evolution from three different aspects: enabling technology evolution, OS architecture evolution and cloud ecosystem evolution. We show that finding the appropriate APIs (application programming interfaces) is critical for the next phase of cloud OS evolution. Convenient interfaces need to be provided without scarifying efficiency when APIs are chosen. We present an API-driven cloud OS practice, showing the great capability of APIs for developing a better cloud OS and helping build and run the cloud ecosystem healthily.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11390-017-1717-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To achieve this, we propose the Responsive City, in which citizens, enabled by technology, take on an active role in urban planning processes. Adequate planning of Responsive Cities requires a change and evolvement of the role of policy-makers, government experts, urban planners, and architects. A key factor is hereby the understanding of urban dynamics. In this paper we present a method to model the dynamics of the city from the viewpoint of the urban metabolism as a system of stocks and flows. Understanding these flows helps to identify the main characteristics of the city and advances the knowledge of relationships between different stocks and flows in the system. Big Data can inform and support this process with evidence by taking advantage of behavioural data from infrastructure sensors and crowdsourcing initiatives. They can be overlaid with spatial information in order to respond to events in decreasing time spans by automating the response process partially, which is a necessity for any resilient city management.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00287-016-1005-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Understanding the spatio-temporal bike trip patterns in a bike sharing system, such as the popular trip origins and destinations during rush hours, is important for researchers to design models for bike scheduling and station management. However, due to privacy and operational concerns, bike trip data are usually not publicly available in many cities. Instead, the station feeds about real-time bike and dock number in stations are usually public, which we refer to as bike sharing system open data. In this paper, we propose an approach to infer the spatio-temporal bike trip patterns from the public station feeds. Since the number of possible trips (i.e., origin-destination station pairs) is much larger than the number of stations, we define the trip inference as an ill-posed inverse problem. To solve this problem, we identify the sparsity and locality properties of bike trip patterns, and propose a sparse and weighted regularization model to impose both properties in the solution. We evaluate our method using real-world data fromWashington, D.C. and New York City. Results show that our method can effectively infer the spatio-temporal bike trip patterns and outperform the baselines in both cities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-016-6006-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, in many applications such as advertisement, recommendation systems, social networks, customer relationship management, and clinical prediction, the users need not only accurate prediction, but also suggestions on actions to achieve a desirable goal (e.g., high ads hit rates) or avert an undesirable predicted result (e.g., clinical deterioration). Existing works for extracting such actionability are few and limited to simple models such as a decision tree. The dilemma is that those models with high accuracy are often more complex and harder to extract actionability from. In this paper, we propose an effective method to extract actionable knowledge from additive tree models (ATMs), one of the most widely used and best off-the-shelf classifiers. We rigorously formulate the optimal actionable planning (OAP) problem for a given ATM, which is to extract an actionable plan for a given input so that it can achieve a desirable output while maximizing the net profit. Based on a state space graph formulation, we first propose an optimal heuristic search method which intends to find an optimal solution. Then, we also present a sub-optimal heuristic search with an admissible and consistent heuristic function which can remarkably improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

Control of power grid nodes may consist of an important tool in cyberattackers’ hands to bring chaos in the electric power system. An intelligent system is proposed for analyzing loads at the nodal level in order to detect whether a cyberattack has occurred in the node. The proposed system integrates computational intelligence with kernel modeled Gaussian processes and fuzzy logic.

CAVE systems have been widely used in many applications, such as architectural and industrial design, medical training and surgery plan, museums and education. However, one limitation for most of the current CAVE systems is that they are separated from the real world. The user in the CAVE is not able to sense the real world around him or her. In this paper, we propose a vConnect architecture, which aims to establish real-time bidirectional information exchange between the virtual world and the real world by utilizing the advanced technologies in cloud computing, mobile communications, wireless sensor networks, and computer vision. Specifically, we address three technical challenges in the proposed vConnect architecture. First, we propose an optimal allocation scheme for the wireless sensor networks to ensure that the data streams captured by the sensors can be delivered to the cloud servers in a reliable and prompt way. Second, we optimize the allocation of the cloud resources to ensure that the data streams sent from the clients can be processed promptly by the cloud servers at a minimal resource cost. Third, we propose to use marker-based finger interactions such that the user in the CAVE can manipulate the information in a natural and intuitive way. Fourth, we implemented a vHealth prototype, a CAVE-based real-time health monitoring system, to validate the proposed vConnect architecture. We demonstrated in the vHealth prototype that the user in the CAVE can visualize and manipulate the real-time physiological data of the patient who is being monitored, and interact with the patient.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-015-3121-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We investigated attention related modalities of P300 ERP component and engagement index (EI), which is extracted from signal power ratios of α, β and θ frequency bands. Simultaneously, we quantified the task unrelated movements, which are previously reported to be related to attention level, in an automated way employing kinect TM sensor. Reaction times were also recorded and investigated. We found that during the monotonous task, both the P300 amplitude and EI decreased as the time of the task progressed. On the other hand, the increase of the task unrelated movement quantity was observed, together with the increase in RTs. These findings lead to conclusion that the monotonous assembly work induces the decrease of attention and engagement of the workers as the task progresses, which is observable in both neural (EEG) and behavioral (RT and unrelated movements) signal modalities. Apart from observing how the attention-related modalities are changing over time, we investigated the functional relationship between the neural and behavioral modalities by using Pearson’s correlation. Since the Person’s correlation coefficients showed the functional relationship between the attention-related modalities, we proposed the creation of the multimodal implicit Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system, which could acquire and process neural and behavioral data in real-time, with the aim of creating the system that could be aware of the operator’s mental states during the industrial work, consequently improving the operator’s well-being.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58628-1_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To manage this, SmartCities are deploying truly distributed and highly scalable information and communication (ICT) infrastructure, connecting a conglomerate of smart devices and ‘smart things’. In recent years, the term Internet-of-Things (IoT) was coined to describe constrained systems that react via sensors to physical changes in its environment and may be able to influence that environment via actuators. While ICT generally helps to ‘mine’ collected information, the IoT complements this with direct access to a sensor’s data or even taking immediate corrective action. Using the capabilities of the IoT to monitor and control the SmartCity implies numerous devices communicate data about the city its citizens. The communicated data is used to make decisions that will affect many citizens, and if not secured correctly, attackers (or other ‘errors’) could disrupt operation of the SmartCity. Moreover, collected data possibly impinges on basic privacy rights if not gathered, communicated and processed correctly. This chapter provides a primer on general information security, its main goals, and the basic IoT security challenges in the SmartCity. Built upon the basic IT security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, this chapter addresses security and privacy problems faced in the communication aspects of the SmartCity. We highlight that security is a crucial enabler for the ICT-dependent SmartCity to base the decisions on reliable data and to execute commands securely. We specifically point out that security starts at the very beginning of the data collection and communication process.

One problem of using the same device for multiple tasks is that each task requires a different security model. To address this problem, we introduce Droid Mood Swing (DMS), an operating system component that applies different security policies to detected security modes automatically. DMS uses a context manager that tracks the context of the phone from the available sensors. DMS then determines the security mode from the contexts and can impose a number of security measures, namely fine-grained permissions, an intent firewall, a context-aware SD card filesystem, and a permission verification system. The permission verification system uses machine learning techniques to detect suspicious apps and anomalous permission requests. DMS also provides an API that enables third-party developers to make their apps behave differently in different modes. DMS is designed especially for end users and does not compromise the usability of the phone. Device vendors will be able to control configurations (a switching logic and security policies) of the modes through DMS. We implement DMS using the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and evaluate it in terms of portability, functionality, security, and operational overheads. The evaluation results show that DMS offers a more secure smartphone operating system without incurring any noticeable overhead.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69659-1_18,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To collect these data, a smartphone application is provided. One feature is a driving recorder that collects not only sensor data but also videos recorded from the driver’s point of view. To extract specific roadside phenomena, the collected data are integrated and analyzed using the service platform. The proposed smartphone application offers the following advantages over appliances: (1) ordinary appliances are stand-alone, which means that storage is limited, whereas the application is connected to the cloud; (2) appliances are not cheap, whereas the application is free; and (3) appliances only store driving records, whereas the application can obtain feedback from the service platform. The authors expect that these advantages will provide citizens with the necessary incentive to use the application.

However, IoT-driven healthcare would have to overcome many barriers, such as: (1) There is an increasing demand for data storage on cloud servers where the analysis of the medical big data becomes increasingly complex; (2) The data, when communicated, are vulnerable to security and privacy issues; (3) The communication of the continuously collected data is not only costly but also energy hungry; (4) Operating and maintaining the sensors directly from the cloud servers are non-trial tasks. This book chapter defined Fog Computing in the context of medical IoT. Conceptually, Fog Computing is a service-oriented intermediate layer in IoT, providing the interfaces between the sensors and cloud servers for facilitating connectivity, data transfer, and queryable local database. The centerpiece of Fog computing is a low-power, intelligent, wireless, embedded computing node that carries out signal conditioning and data analytics on raw data collected from wearables or other medical sensors and offers efficient means to serve telehealth interventions. We implemented and tested an fog computing system using the Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that allows acquisition, computing, storage and communication of the various medical data such as pathological speech data of individuals with speech disorders, Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal for heart rate estimation, and Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based Q, R, S detection.

Although huge sensing data are collected in cloud, generally cloud systems are facing poor scalability and difficulty of real-time feedback. In this paper, we focus on geospatial sensing data welled out continuously everywhere and consider how we can treat such huge sensing data. Here, first we introduce the notion of “Edge Computing,” and explain its history, features, and research challenge. Then, we discuss about how we can apply this notion for designing scalable IoT-based social systems. As an example, we introduce our recent research work about the development of IoT-based cyber physical systems (CPS). Especially, we focus on safety management in urban districts by estimating up-to-date (real-time) population distribution and creating pedestrian mobility in urban districts from inaccurate sensing information. In urban areas, we might only be able to use heterogeneous sensors with different accuracy for crowd sensing. Thus, we propose a method for creating realistic human mobility using such heterogeneous sensors, and explain techniques to reproduce passages, add normal/emergency pedestrian flows, and check efficiency of evacuation plans on 3D map so that local governments can make efficient evacuation plans.

Further on, all kinds of physical, mechanical, electrical, and electronics systems are adequately empowered to be instrumented and interconnected to exhibit intelligent behavior. Further on, all kinds of connected devices and digitized objects in our everyday environments are systematically integrated with remotely held and cloud-hosted applications, services, and data sources in order to be adaptive in their deeds, decisions, and deliveries. The faster maturity and stability of edge technologies such as bar codes, application-specific chips, microcontrollers, stickers, labels, tags, smart dust, specks, sensors, actuators, LED lights, etc. speeds up the production of digitized objects, alternatively termed as smart or sentient materials. Every common, casual, and cheap item can be transitioned into digitized entities and elements in order to join in the mainstream computing.

Both are generally seen as spatial models, but they can as easily capture network aspects of social complexity. Processes of urbanization and opinion dynamics are often simulated through the use of cellular automata. Spatial or organizational agent-based models are used to simulate social complexity in an increasing variety of domains, ranging from cultural dynamics to financial crises; from regional transportation systems to public health management; from humanitarian crises to global processes, such as climate change and the rise and fall of polities and civilizations. Agent-based simulations do this by using the versatility of multi-agent systems as computational frameworks within which modelers and programmers integrate social, natural, and artificial entities and dynamics.

For the above reason, intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and location-based services (LBSs) have become an interesting research area over the last years. Due to the rapid increase of data volume within the transportation domain, cloud environment is of paramount importance for storing, accessing, handling, and processing such huge amounts of data. A large part of data within the transportation domain is produced in the form of Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Such a kind of data is usually infrequent and noisy and achieving the quality of real-time transport applications based on GPS is a difficult task. The map-matching process, which is responsible for the accurate alignment of observed GPS positions onto a road network, plays a pivotal role in many ITS applications. Regarding accuracy, the performance of a map-matching strategy is based on the shortest path between two consecutive observed GPS positions. On the other extreme, processing shortest path queries (SPQs) incurs high computational cost. Current map-matching techniques are approached with a fixed number of parameters, i.e., the number of candidate points ( N CP ) and error circle radius (ECR), which may lead to uncertainty when identifying road segments and either low-accurate results or a large number of SPQs. Moreover, due to the sampling error, GPS data with a high-sampling period (i.e., less than 10 s) typically contains extraneous datum, which also incurs an extra number of SPQs. Due to the high computation cost incurred by SPQs, current map-matching strategies are not suitable for real-time processing. In this paper, we propose real-time map-matching (called RT-MM), which is a fully adaptive map-matching strategy based on cloud to address the key challenge of SPQs in a map-matching process for real-time GPS trajectories. The evaluation of our approach against state-of-the-art approaches is performed through simulations based on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/FITEE.1600027,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For this reason, it would be desirable to create integrated smart traffic management systems capable of providing real-time information to drivers about the location of available vacant parking spots. A scalable solution would consist in exploiting the existing and widely-deployed video surveillance camera networks, which requires the development of computer vision algorithms for detecting vacant parking spots. Following this idea, this work introduces QuickSpot, a car-driven video analytics solution for on-street vacant parking spot detection designed as a motion detection, object tracking and visual recognition pipeline. One of the main features of QuickSpot is its simplified setup, as it can be trained on external databases to learn the appearances of the objects it is capable of recognizing (pedestrians and vehicles). To test its performance under different daytime lighting conditions, we have recorded, edited, annotated and made available to the research community the QuickSpotDB video database for the vacant parking spot detection problem. In the conducted experiments, we have evaluated the trade-off between the accuracy and the computational complexity of QuickSpot with an eye to its practical applicability. The results show that QuickSpot detects parking spot status with an average accuracy close to 99 % at a 1-second rate regardless of the illumination conditions, outperforming in an indirect comparison the other car-driven approaches reported in the literature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-016-3773-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

WSNs tend to rely on ad-hoc infrastructures that are prone to a wide range of different defects, e.g., communication failures, faulty sensors or nodes that have been tampered with. Additionally, dealing with defects is challenging, as defects might occur only occasionally. In this paper, we introduce SEDEL, our approach for Sensor nEtwork DEfect Localization. SEDEL helps the WSN operator to pinpoint defective nodes in the routing topology of a WSN. In particular, we let the operator store graph representations of the routing topology, together with information if the WSN has produced errors. Based on this information, SEDEL assigns each WSN node a suspiciousness score that is correlated with the defect probability. Thus, our approach can be used with any kind of defect, and the kind does not have to be known, as long as the operator can decide if a certain processing is correct or not.

Big data has become a popular term which is used to describe the exponential growth and availability of data. In practice, the growing demand for large-scale data processing and data analysis applications spurred the development of novel solutions from both the industry and academia.

However, in recent years, academia and industry have started to recognize the limitations of the Hadoop framework in several application domains and big data processing scenarios such as large scale processing of structured data, graph data and streaming data.

However, detecting abnormal crowd behaviors is challenging in that movements of individuals are usually random and unpredictable, and the occlusions caused by over-crowding make the task more difficult. In this paper, we introduce thermodynamic micro-statistics theory to detect and localize abnormal behaviors in crowded scenes based on Boltzmann Entropy. For this purpose, the scene of interest is modeled as moving particles turned out from a general optical flow algorithm. The particles are grouped into a set of prototypes according to their speeds and directions of moving, and a histogram is established to figure out how the particles distribute over the prototypes. Here, Boltzmann Entropy is computed from the histogram for each video clip to characterize the chaos degree of crowd motion. By means of such feature extraction, the crowd motion patterns can be represented as a time series. We find that when most people behave anomaly in an area under surveillance, the corresponding entropy value will increase remarkably in comparison with those of normal cases. This motives us to make use of Boltzmann Entropy to distinguish the collective behaviors of people under emergent circumstances from their normal behaviors by evaluating how significantly the current feature value fits into the Gaussian model of normal cases. We validate our method extensively for anomaly detection and localization. The experimental results show promising performance compared with the state of the art methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-015-3101-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Personalized recommendation has attracted researchers’ special attention because it is more targeted to individual tasks with the characteristics of diversification and novelty. However, the data sets that personalized recommendation process usually possess the characteristics of data sparseness and information loss, which is more likely to have problems such as cognitive deviation and interest drift. To solve these issues, in recent years people gradually notice the important role in which trust factor plays in promoting the development of personalized recommendation. Given the difference between online social trust and traditional offline social trust in facilitating personalized recommendation, this paper proposes a novel technique of online social trust reinforced personal recommendation to improve the recommendation performance. Compared with traditional offline social trust-based personal recommendation, our work synthesizes both factors of online social trust and offline social trust to identify private and public trusted user communities. The trusted degree or the accredited degree can be deduced by Bayesian network probabilistic inferences. In this way, the performance of personalized recommendation can be improved by avoiding excessive interest deviation. Moreover, we also get time sequence into personal recommendation model to effectively track how user’s interest changes over time. Accordingly, the recommendation accuracy can be improved by eliminating the unfavorable effect of interest drift caused by temporal variation. Empirical experiments on typical Yelp testing data set illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation technique.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-016-0923-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The extended use of Smart Meters for measuring residential electricity consumption facilitates the creation of such intelligent environments. In this context, this article proposes a system which extracts value from the collected consumer information to identify the appliances belonging to that smart environment by means of machine learning techniques.

Using such models it is possible to define strategies for optimizing the day-to-day energy consumption of buildings.

Large-scale access to citizens’ data allow surveillance and discriminatory actions that may result in segregation phenomena in society. On the contrary are the benefits of accurate computing analytics required for more informed decision-making, more effective policies and regulation of techno-socio-economic systems supported by ‘Internet-of Things’ technologies. In contrast to earlier work that either focuses on privacy protection or Big Data analytics, this paper proposes a self-regulatory information sharing system that bridges this gap. This is achieved by modeling information sharing as a supply-demand system run by computational markets. On the supply side lie the citizens that make incentivized but self-determined decisions about the level of information they share. On the demand side stand data aggregators that provide rewards to citizens to receive the required data for accurate analytics. The system is empirically evaluated with two real-world datasets from two application domains: (i) Smart Grids and (ii) mobile phone sensing. Experimental results quantify trade-offs between privacy-preservation, accuracy of analytics and costs from the provided rewards under different experimental settings. Findings show a higher privacy-preservation that depends on the number of participating citizens and the type of data summarized. Moreover, analytics with summarization data tolerate high local errors without a significant influence on the global accuracy. In other words, local errors cancel out. Rewards can be optimized to be fair so that citizens with more significant sharing of information receive higher rewards. All these findings motivate a new paradigm of truly decentralized and ethical data analytics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0074-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To enjoy the power of them, the human society needs solutions to transform the energies mentioned above into electric energy, at specific reliability, efficiency and sustainability parameters. Maintaining this kind of parameters implies, among other things, the careful and permanent monitoring of equipment. The monitoring process implies remote monitoring, as we are talking about preserving natural resources. The equipment is mostly situated in the middle of nature, covering large areas mostly outside of populated locations. In their great majority installations for wind and solar energy have been designed and manufactured relatively recently, which makes them contain systems of tele-monitoring that are designed and included by default, as a part of great importance to the entire investment. The situation is different in the case of hydroelectric plants, which have a tradition of over 130 years and have been and are still built to this day. Renewable energy sources are being increasingly used and need to be constantly monitored for optimizing the power grid. Unfortunately, such micro power plants are located in difficult to access remote locations where often only satellite or sparse GSM radio signals are available. In this paper we study the way how to process big data gathered by a decentralized cloud system, based on general systems and remote telemetry units (RTUs), for tele-monitoring of renewable energy objectives. Also, we analyze a proposed cloud M2M system, where each RTU communicates by radio with a telemetry data gateway connected to a cloud computing infrastructure equipped with appropriate software that delivers processed data. Furthermore, we present how we use a search based application built on Exalead CloudView to search for weak signals in big data. In particular, given the telemetry application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from other online environmental wireless sensor networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between renewable energies and environmental related issues faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data. As a consequence, the software has a significant potential for matching environmental applications and challenges that are related in non-obvious ways. Finally, we present the measurement results for a hydro-energy case study and discuss the applicability for other renewable sources such as solar or wind energy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-015-2527-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This chapter revisits a previously proposed architecture to extract, load, transform, mine and forecast Big Data within a Smart City context, in order to discuss the adequacy of NoSQL databases to deliver a Smart City service that reinvents the traditional energy bill, using web and mobile applications. Citizens will benefit from a new form of self-monitoring their electricity and gas consumption, by comparing themselves to others within their cluster or region and by forecasting future energy consumptions. Moreover, the service also delivers to energy providers and cities a smarter overview of the energy landscape. The technological architecture was previously validated using simulated data from the United States of America (USA), due to its open availability, and revealed very satisfactory results concerning the performance of clustering and time series forecasting models. This chapter extends the previously proposed technological architecture, by providing real-time concurrent web and mobile access to citizens, while presenting a broad review of several NoSQL benchmarks available in the scientific community, knowledge that is essential in the adoption of a specific database to support these web and mobile applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-1088-0_29,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The coming together of these new developments in these synergetic fields has allowed sensor designers and manufacturers to take a completely novel approach, such as introducing intelligence for self-monitoring and self-calibration, thereby increasing the performance of their technical products. Similarly, the advances in sensor manufacturing technologies facilitate the production of systems and components with a low cost-to-performance ratio. This includes advances in microsystem technologies, where manufacturers are increasingly adopting techniques such as surface and bulk micromachining. Furthermore, initiatives exploring the potential in the field of digital signal processing involve novel approaches for the improvement of sensor properties. These improvements in sensor performance and quality mean that multi-sensor systems, which are the foundation of the Industrial Internet, can significantly contribute to the enhancement of the quality and availability of information. Due to these initiatives and an innovative approach by designers, this has led to new sensor structures, manufacturing technologies, and signal processing methods in individual and multi-sensor systems.

This applies to any of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications where number of sensors and other smart devices are deployed. These sensors and smart devices embedded in IoT networks continually produce huge amounts of data. These data streams from heterogeneous sources arrive at high rates and need to be processed in real time in order to detect more complex situations from the low-level information embedded in the data. Complex event processing (CEP) has emerged as an appropriate approach to tackle such scenarios. Complex event processing is the technology used to process one or more streams of data/events and identify patterns of interest from multiple streams of events to derive a meaningful conclusion. This chapter proposes CEP-based solution to continuously collect and analyze the data generated from multiple sources in real time.

Journey prices can change dynamically in almost real time and also vary geographically from one area to another in a city, a strategy known as surge pricing. In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open datasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies that emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more transparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price comparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover that Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher fares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in occurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone application, OpenStreetCab , that offers a personalized consultation to mobile users on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months after its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a single city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the potential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a highlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per taxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive experiments to show how Uber’s surge pricing is the driving factor of higher journey prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application’s users. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber’s surge pricing is occurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction task where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area’s tendency to surge. Using exogenous to Uber data, in particular Yellow Cab and Foursquare data, we show how it is possible to estimate customer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0060-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It focuses on the three main concepts of uncertain evidence , namely likelihood evidence and fixed and not-fixed probabilistic evidence , using a review of previous literature. A probabilistic finding on a variable is specified by a local probability distribution and replaces any former belief in that variable. It is said to be fixed or not fixed regarding whether it has to be kept unchanged or not after the arrival of observation on other variables. Fixed probabilistic evidence is defined by Valtorta et al. (J Approx Reason 29(1):71–106 2002 ) under the name soft evidence , whereas the concept of not-fixed probabilistic evidence has been discussed by Chan and Darwiche (Artif Intell 163(1):67–90 2005 ). Both concepts have to be clearly distinguished from likelihood evidence defined by Pearl ( 1988 ), also called virtual evidence , for which evidence is specified as a likelihood ratio, that often represents the unreliability of the evidence. Since these three concepts of uncertain evidence are not widely understood, and the terms used to describe these concepts are not well established, most Bayesian networks engines do not offer well defined propagation functions to handle them. Firstly, we present a review of uncertain evidence and the proposed terminology, definitions and concepts related to the use of uncertain evidence in Bayesian networks. Then we describe updating algorithms for the propagation of uncertain evidence. Finally, we propose several results where the use of fixed or not-fixed probabilistic evidence is required.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-015-0678-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One example is the smart electricity infrastructure, which generates huge volumes of such data from sources such as smart electricity meters. Although today these data are used for visualization and billing in mostly 15-min resolution, its original temporal resolution frequently is more fine-grained, e.g., seconds. This is useful for various analytical applications such as short-term forecasting, disaggregation and visualization. However, transmitting and storing huge amounts of such fine-grained data are prohibitively expensive in terms of storage space in many cases. In this article, we present a compression technique based on piecewise regression and two methods which describe the performance of the compression. Although our technique is a general approach for time-series compression, smart grids serve as our running example and as our evaluation scenario. Depending on the data and the use-case scenario, the technique compresses data by ratios of up to factor 5,000 while maintaining its usefulness for analytics.

The contributions of this chapter are threefold: (1) we provide an overview of Big Data and Internet of Things technologies including a summary of their relationships, (2) we present a case study in the smart grid domain that illustrates the high-level requirements towards such an analytical Big Data framework, and (3) we present an initial version of such a framework mainly addressing the volume and velocity challenge.

Meanwhile, Open Data has arisen as a way to freely share contents to be consumed without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. Nowadays, Open Data is an achievable concept thanks to the World Wide Web, and has been re-defined for its application in different domains. Regarding public administrations, the concept of Open Government has found an ally in Open Data concepts, defending citizens’ right to access data, documentation and proceedings of the governments. We propose the use of Linked Open Data , a set of best practices to publish data on the Web recommended by the W3C, in a new data life cycle management model, allowing governments and individuals to handle better their data, easing its consumption by anybody, including both companies and third parties interested in the exploitation of the data, and citizens as end users receiving relevant curated information and reports about their city. In summary, Linked Open Data uses the previous Openness concepts to evolve from an infrastructure thought for humans, to an architecture for the automatic consumption of big amounts of data, providing relevant and high-quality data to end users with low maintenance costs. Consequently, smart data can now be achievable in smart cities.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09177-8_18,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, for achieving user-centric aware IoT that brings together people and their devices into a sustainable ecosystem, first, it is necessary to deal with the integration of disparate technologies, ensuring trusted communications, managing the huge amount of data and services, and bringing users to an active involvement. In this chapter, we describe such challenges and present the interesting user-centric perspective of IoT. Furthermore, a management platform for smart environments is presented as a proposal to cover these needs, based on a layered architecture using artificial intelligent capabilities to transform raw data into semantically meaningful information used by services. Two real use cases framed in the smart buildings field exemplify the usefulness of this proposal through a real-system implementation called City Explorer .

Information is difficult to assimilate both from structured and unstructured data that may be collected in real-time. Unreliability of mostly unstructured data from social media and mobile devices, though extremely helpful, can make it difficult to deploy needed help/assistance in time. Ad hoc planning specifically targeted at saving lives may be severely hampered when part of the infrastructure is destroyed that is normally relied on for data collection. Also when part of the infrastructure is destroyed that normally is relied on for collecting structured data, the situation can even make it harder for ad hoc planning specifically targeted at saving lives first. In such situations, a combination of unstructured data that carries uncertainties and limited structured data from infrastructure that might still be working after/during a disaster event can be used to the best of advantages and still enhance the control process to better achieve desired outcomes: i.e. real-time event monitoring through real-time limited and high uncertainty data; filtering unstructured data through crowd sourcing, not only for reliability but sometimes for language translation as well; short-term predictions of anticipated changes from already existing interoperable simulation models, using the limited structured data from infrastructure that might be still standing following a disaster; and all this with the aim of appropriate, timely responses to saving lives in a rapidly evolving environment. A generic management framework designed to be used during a “phase transition” between pre- and post events, and characterised by the interoperability of distributed simulation models, and the collection and sharing of structured and unstructured data via cloud services and “connected devices”, is essential for the consistent provision of highly effective responses. We explore this framework from a science and innovations perspective, advocating “antifragility” for emergency response system designs. For antifragility systems, failures do not stand for a breakdown or malfunctioning of normal system functions, but rather represent the adaptations necessary to cope with the real world complexity through the management of “robustness trade-offs” as it occurs in dynamic and real-world contexts.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-08819-8_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper proposes a novel approach, namely the periodicity detection map (PDM), to quickly identify BG traffic based on periodicity analysis as BG traffic is commonly periodically generated by applications. However, it is not necessary that every BG traffic flow is periodic, hence the periodicity analysis based approaches cannot detect non-periodic BG flows. This paper also discusses the capability of applying a machine learning based classification method whose training dataset is collected from the results of the PDM method to solve this issue.

Moreover, as research subjects, they are positioned in a field of tension between social, political, and cultural practices and the performance aspects of technological systems. While such visions emanate from the transformational effects of computing, where concepts of paradigm and paradigm shift do actually hold, they still entail a lot of aspects of discursive nature in the sense of a set of concepts, ideas, claims, assumptions, and premises that are socio-culturally specific and historically contingent. The aim of this chapter is twofold: (1) to examine and classify multiple aspects of the paradigmatic dimension and key aspects of the discursive dimension of AmI and the IoT and related key issues, and (2) to investigate from a discursive analytical perspective knowledge/power relations, subject positioning, and legitimation pertaining to AmI and the IoT as discourses. I argue that there is a paradigm profile relating to (ubiquitous) computing, but there is no paradigm in society—nor should there be. In view of that, AmI and the IoT as computing paradigms are affected by knowledge/power relations in the sense of possessing the particularity of having a scientific-objective foundation, and I contend that this allows their promoters, creators, and producers to link AmI and the IoT with the scientific knowledge (and discourse), which is one of today’s main sources of legitimacy in European society in relation to knowledge-making, decision-making, and policy-making. As societal discourses, they are, as results suggest, constructed in correspondence with the subjects—favorably positioned within such discourses—that support them with regard to their institutional belonging, scholarly affiliation, social location, cultural inclination, ideological commitment, and/or socio-political status. This involves biases in the strategic actions of these subjects as well as their mode of calculation about their ‘objective ideal and material interests’.

One major challenge is how to take advantage of the unprecedented scale of data—typically of heterogeneous nature—in order to acquire further insights and knowledge for improving the quality of the offered services. To exploit this new resource, we need to scale up and scale out both our infrastructures and standard techniques.

However, in a subway environment, such positioning systems are not available for the positioning tasks, such as the detection of the train arrivals for the passengers in the train. An alternative approach is to exploit the contextual information available in the mobile devices of subway riders to detect train arrivals. To this end, we propose to exploit multiple contextual features extracted from the mobile devices of subway riders to precisely detecting train arrivals. Following this line, we first investigate potential contextual features which may be effective to detect train arrivals according to the observations from 3D accelerometers and GSM radio. Furthermore, we propose to explore the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model for training a train arrival detector by learning the correlation between contextual features and train arrivals. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on several real-world data sets collected from two major subway lines in the Beijing subway system.

Eventually, a mix of different technologies can even be present in a given building. IoT principles are now appearing in buildings as a way to simplify and standardise application development. Nevertheless, many issues remain due to this heterogeneity between existing installations and native IP devices that induces complexity and maintenance efforts of building management systems. A key success factor for the IoT adoption in Smart Buildings is to provide a loosely-coupled Web protocol stack allowing interoperation between all devices present in a building. We review in this chapter different strategies that are going in this direction.

Organisations, governments and individuals are creating increasingly large data sources, and in many cases making them publicly available. This offers massive potential for interaction and mutual collaboration. But using this data often creates problems. Those creating the data will use their own terminology, structure and formats for the data, meaning that data from one source will be incompatible with data from another source. When presented with a large, unknown data source, it is very difficult to ascribe meaning to the terms of that data source, and to understand what is being conveyed. Much effort has been invested in data interpretation prior to run-time, with large data sources being matched against each other off-line. But data is often used dynamically, and so to maximise the value of the data it is necessary to extract meaning from it dynamically. We therefore postulate that an essential competent of utilising the world of data in which we increasingly live is the development of the ability to discover meaning on the go in large, heterogenous data.This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art, reviewing the aims and achievements in different fields which can be applied to this problem.

This chapter focuses on the interdependencies between information technology and nanotechnology, especially in electronics, visualization and simulation of data, and computational tools; it notes connections of information technology to biotechnology as well, and also gives attention to the connections between information technology and cognitive and social sciences. Examples of societal impacts are “creative disruption” in economy and society, the gradual democratization of the Internet via open-source software and the expansion of “citizen science”; the broadening of the global information infrastructure built of participatory communities of users of shared content; evolution of “consumer robotics,” and conceptualization of computing as services and thus dependent upon the co-evolution of information technology with “rules”—with impacts on future policymaking and governance. The focus is on improving human quality of life through convergence of information technology with other technologies. Equity of access between communities and nations is an ongoing area of concern.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-02204-8_2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1140/epjst/e2012-01690-3,Towards a global participatory platform,The European Physical Journal Special Topics,10.1140/epjst/e2012-01690-3,Springer,2012-11-01,"Abstract The FuturICT project seeks to use the power of big data, analytic models grounded in complexity science, and the collective intelligence they yield for societal benefit. Accordingly, this paper argues that these new tools should not remain the preserve of restricted government, scientific or corporate élites, but be opened up for societal engagement and critique. To democratise such assets as a public good, requires a sustainable ecosystem enabling different kinds of stakeholder in society, including but not limited to, citizens and advocacy groups, school and university students, policy analysts, scientists, software developers, journalists and politicians. Our working name for envisioning a sociotechnical infrastructure capable of engaging such a wide constituency is the Global Participatory Platform (GPP). We consider what it means to develop a GPP at the different levels of data, models and deliberation, motivating a framework for different stakeholders to find their ecological niches at different levels within the system, serving the functions of (i) sensing the environment in order to pool data, (ii) mining the resulting data for patterns in order to model the past/present/future, and (iii) sharing and contesting possible interpretations of what those models might mean, and in a policy context, possible decisions. A research objective is also to apply the concepts and tools of complexity science and social science to the project’s own work. We therefore conceive the global participatory platform as a resilient, epistemic ecosystem, whose design will make it capable of self-organization and adaptation to a dynamic environment, and whose structure and contributions are themselves networks of stakeholders, challenges, issues, ideas and arguments whose structure and dynamics can be modelled and analysed.

We all make frequent attempts to reason causation relationships of everyday events (e.g., what was the cause of my headache, or what has upset Alice?). We attempt to manage causality all the time through planning and scheduling. The greatest scientific discoveries are usually about causality (e.g., Newton found the cause for an apple to fall, and Darwin discovered natural selection). Meanwhile, we continue to seek a comprehensive understanding about the causes of numerous complex phenomena, such as social divisions, economic crisis, global warming, home-grown terrorism, etc. Humans analyse and reason causality based on observation, experimentation and acquired a priori knowledge. Today’s technologies enable us to make observations and carry out experiments in an unprecedented scale that has created data mountains everywhere. Whereas there are exciting opportunities to discover new causation relationships, there are also unparalleled challenges to benefit from such data mountains. In this article, we present a case for developing a new piece of ICT, called Causality Discovery Technology . We reason about the necessity, feasibility and potential impact of such a technology.

The rationale resides on the political and economic will towards a sustainable environment as well as advances in information and communication technologies that are rapidly being introduced into modern passenger vehicles. From a user perspective, safety and convenience are always a major concern. Further, new vehicles should enable people to drive that presently can not as well as to facilitate the continued mobility of the aging population. Advances are led by endeavors from vehicle manufacturers, the military and academia and development of sensors applicable to ground vehicles. Initially, the motivators are detailed on the reasons that vehicles are being built with intelligent capabilities. An outline of the navigation problem is presented to provide an understanding of the functions needed for a vehicle to navigate autonomously. In order to provide an overall perspective on how technology is converging towards vehicles with autonomous capabilities, advances have been classified into driver centric, network centric and vehicle centric. Vehicle manufacturers are introducing at a rapid pace Advanced Driving Assistance Systems; these are considered as Driver Centric with all functions facilitating driver awareness. This has resulted on the introduction of perception sensors utilizable in traffic situations and technologies that are advancing from simple (targeted to inform drivers) towards the control of the vehicle. The introduction of wireless links onboard vehicles should enable the sharing of information and thus enlarge the situational awareness of drivers as the perceived area is enlarged. Network Centric vehicles provide the means to perceive areas that vehicle onboard sensors alone can not observe and thus grant functions that allow for the deployment of vehicles with autonomous capabilities. Finally, vehicle centric functions are examined; these apply directly to the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Efforts in this realm are not new and thus fundamental work in this area is included. Sensors capable to detect objects in the road network are identified as dictating the pace of developments. The availability of intelligent sensors, advanced digital maps, and wireless communications technologies together with the availability of electric vehicles should allow for deployment on public streets without any environment modification. Likely, there will first be self-driving cars followed by environment modifications to facilitate their deployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-85729-085-4_50,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, the extremely large volume of document collections makes it unfeasible to manually handle such documents. In addition, most of the documents exist in an unstructured form and do not follow any schemas. Therefore, research efforts in this direction are being dedicated to automatically infer structure and schemas. This is essential in order to properly organize huge collections as well as to effectively and efficiently retrieve documents in in . This chapter presents a survey of the state-of-the-art methods for inferring structure from documents and schemas in networked environments.

In particular, an ontology-based architecture is described that allows system designers to specify non trivial situations the system must be able to detect on the basis of available sensory data. Relevant situations may include activities and events that could be prolonged over long periods of time. Therefore, the ontology encodes temporal operators that, once applied to sensory information, allow to efficiently recognize and correlate different human activities and other events whose temporal relationships are contextually important. Special emphasis is devoted to actual representation and recognition of temporally distributed situations. The proof of concept is validated through a thoroughly described example of system usage.",http://dx.doi.org/10.2991/978-94-91216-05-3_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
