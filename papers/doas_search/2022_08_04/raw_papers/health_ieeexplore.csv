A steadily increasing trend of obesity is not only limited to developed countries, but to developing nations as well. As smartphones have rapidly gained mainstream popularity, mobile applications (apps) are used in public health as intervention to keep track of diets, activity as well as weight, which is deemed more accurate than relying on user's self-report measure, for the sake of weight management. A solution called “Smart Wireless Interactive Healthcare System” (SWITCHes) is developed to facilitate objective data reception and transmission in a real-time manner. Based on the user data acquired from SWITCHes app and the auxiliary data from medical instruments, not only SWITCHes app can engage user with tailored feedback in an interactive way, in terms of artificial intelligence-powered health chatbot, but the healthcare professional can provide the more accurate medical advice to user also. This paper presents an overview of development and implementation of SWITCHes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8607399/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM),16-19 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Automation and digitalization of marine vessels involve smart digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect ships' health data and send it over to a central processing location where this data is analyzed. However, it is difficult to apply this to the shipping industry due to offshore data transmission bandwidth challenges.

10.1109/TSP.2019.8768883,Edge-AI in LoRa-based Health Monitoring: Fall Detection System with Fog Computing and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Remote healthcare monitoring has exponentially grown over the past decade together with the increasing penetration of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network. We propose a system architecture with integrated artificial intelligence that combines Edge and Fog computing, LPWAN technology, IoT and deep learning algorithms to perform health monitoring tasks. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this architecture via a use case of fall detection using recurrent neural networks. We have implemented a fall detection system from the sensor node and Edge gateway to cloud services and end-user applications.

Hence, building resilient CPSs is a prime need and continuous monitoring of the CPS operational health is essential for improving resilience. This paper presents a framework for calculating and monitoring of health in CPSs using data driven techniques. The main advantages of this data driven methodology is that the ability of leveraging heterogeneous data streams that are available from the CPSs and the ability of performing the monitoring with minimal a priori domain knowledge. The main objective of the framework is to warn the operators of any degradation in cyber, physical or overall health of the CPS.

Further, this paper presents an initial implementation of the first three phases of the framework on a CPS testbed involving a Microgrid simulation and a cyber-network which connects the grid with its controller.

However, these findings fail utilization in real-world clinical settings. The intention of this work is to demonstrate the ability to provide widespread access to medical imaging through computer-assisted technology across various community care providers, thus allowing meaningful use outcomes to population and public health. We have created an end-to-end fully automated approach to mental health screening leveraged by artificial intelligence. This workflow involves four core solutions: a voice-activated user interaction, rapid 3D T1weighted contrast and a resting-state functional acquisition, deep learning-based image analysis, and 3D interactive visualization. Intelligent protocolling is used to obtain optimal pulse sequence parameters to satisfy any time constraint. Rigid registration, k-means tissue classification, and an augmented artificial neural network trained on a public database and Talairach atlas segments out over 60 brain structures with corresponding quantitative measures. Functional MR images are processed via seed-based connectivity to produce functional connectivity maps. Finally, a simplistic user experience implementing text-to-speech, speech-to-text technology coupled with a medical image viewer gives interactive passage to medical imaging results. While various tools have emerged to examine both structural and functional MRI within the research space, a simple straightforward, voice-activated interface to perform the scan, automatically process and retrieve meaningful results, that can be accomplished in less than 20 minutes, enables non-specialists to comprehend all relevant information.

10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531143,Health Risk Prediction Using Big Medical Data - a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The massive amount of medical data accumulated from patients and healthcare providers has become a vast reservoir of knowledge source that may enable promising applications such as risk predictive modeling, clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance. However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system.

Personal activity is an important part of a user's context, and automatically recognizing it is vital for health and fitness monitoring applications. Recording a stream of activity data enables monitoring patients with chronic conditions affecting ambulation and motion, as well as those undergoing rehabilitation treatments. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to perform activity classification in real time, but they typically use a static classifier that is trained in advance or require the user to manually add training data after the application is on his/her device. This paper investigates ways of automatically augmenting activity classifiers after they are deployed in an application. It compares active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods, self-learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning, to determine which show promise for this purpose. The results show that active learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning perform well when the initial classifier's accuracy is low (75-80%). When the initial accuracy is already high (90%), these methods are no longer effective, but they do not hurt the accuracy either. Overall, active learning gave the highest improvement, but democratic co-learning was almost as good and does not require user interaction.

Machine Learning (ML) based health prediction of the patients is the key concept of this research. IBM Cloud, IBM Watson studio is the platform for this research to store and maintain our data and ml models. For our ml models, we have chosen the following Base Predictors: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and MLP Classifier. For improving the accuracy of the model, the bagging method of ensemble learning has been used. The following algorithms are used for ensemble learning: Bagging Random Forest, Bagging Extra Trees, Bagging KNeighbors, Bagging SVC, and Bagging Ridge. We have developed a mobile application named “Critical Patient Management System - CPMS” for real-time data and information view. The system architecture is designed in such a way that the ml models can train and deploy in a real-time interval by retrieving the data from IBM Cloud and the cloud information can also be accessed through CPMS in a requested time interval. To help the doctors, the ml models will predict the condition of a patient. If the prediction based on the condition gets worse, the CPMS will send an SMS to the duty doctor and nurse for getting immediate attention to the patient. Combining with the ml models and mobile application, the project may serve as a smart healthcare solution for the hospitals.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862754/,2019 3rd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI),23-25 April 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

At present health kiosks are deployed in remote villages and basic health data like blood pressure, pulse rate, height-weight, BMI, Oxygen saturation level(SpO2), body temperature are collected by the health workers. Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients. The paper proposes a learning method to managing uncertainty in health data using rough set theory and other relevant attributes like location, time, age etc., which improves primary care to the patients of rural India. The patients belong to the positive region or lower approximation set of rough set are interpreted with certain symptoms while outcome about the patients in the boundary region is uncertain. The proposed method identifies the patients in the boundary region which could be interpreted positively based on specific criteria, defined using different attribute values.

Acceptable performance of such infrastructures, and hence the availability of online services, rely on a very large number of parameters such as per-process resources and configurable system/application parameters. These parameters are available for collection as performance counters distributed across various machines, but services have had a hard time determining which performance counters to monitor and what thresholds to use for performance alarms in a production environment. In this paper, we present a novel framework called PerfAnalyzer, a storage-efficient and pro-active performance monitoring framework for correlating service health with performance counters. PerfAnalyzer automatically infers and builds health models for any service by running the standard suite of predeployment tests for the service and data mining the resulting performance counter data-set. A filtered set of performance counters and thresholds of alarms are produced by our framework. The health model inferred by our framework can then be used to detect performance degradation and collect detailed data for root-cause analysis in a production environment.

Power distribution involves delivering electric power from multiple generation sources to a dynamic set of load devices. Advanced power electronics, intelligent controllers, and a communications infrastructure form a shipboard power distribution network, much like the domestic electric utility power grid. Multiple electric generation and storage devices distributed throughout the ship will eliminate dependence on any single power source through dynamic load management and power grid connectivity. Although new technologies are under development, gas turbine and diesel generators remain as the likely near-term power sources for the future all-electric ship integrated power system (IPS). Health monitoring of these critical IPS power sources are essential to achieving reliability and survivability goals. System complexity, timing constraints, and manning constraints will shift both control and equipment health monitoring functions from human operators to intelligent machines. Drastic manning reductions coupled with a large increase in the number of sensor monitoring points makes automated condition-based maintenance (CBM) a stringent requirement. CBM has traditionally been labor intensive and expensive to implement, relying on human experiential knowledge, interactive data processing, information management, and cognitive processing. The diagnostic robustness and accuracy of these embedded software agents are essential, as false or missed diagnostic calls have severe ramifications within the intelligent, automated control environment. This paper presents some of the first reported results of intelligent diagnostic software agents operating in real-time onboard naval ships with gas turbine and diesel machinery plants. The agents are shown to perform a substantial amount of CBM-related data processing and analysis that would not otherwise be performed by the crew, including real-time, neural network diagnostic inferencing.

Although many studies addressed this challenge, most of them use the same dataset for training and testing. There is no cross-check with other datasets or implementation in real-time to check performance on new data. This is problematic, as evidenced in this paper, because the classifiers overtrain on dataset-specific features. This limits realtime, real-world usage.

The common particularity of all these application domains is that a great part of this data is mostly unlabeled. Thus, designing a learning model with a minimum of labeled data represents a major challenge in the coming years. A particular emphasis has recently been put on unsupervised learning methods based on the idea of autoencoding. The objective of these methods is twofold: to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and to reconstruct the original observation from this lower dimensional representation space. The variational form of these autoencoders, called the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), is particularly successful in almost all application areas. This enthusiasm comes from the fact that VAEs allow to take advantage of the theoretical foundations of the Variational Bayesian methods and the learning capabilities of artificial neural networks.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy.

These provide objective measures of behavioral components like sleep and physical activity. Smartphones are being used increasingly contributing to users&#x2019; screen viewing and hence are capable of providing precise measures of users&#x2019; screen time. Disruption in the key lifestyle patterns like sleep, physical activity and screen viewing may result in health impairments as these correspond to the utmost engaged times during the day. This study presents a novel dataset containing attributes of physical activity, sleep, and smartphone-based screen viewing collected from users&#x2019; smartphones and smartwatches. The dataset contains real time objective measures of activities of 24 undergraduate students. A sleep quality indicator and a behavioral health indicator namely SleepQual and B.Health respectively are evaluated using the extracted features. The instances are labelled based on the scores of SleepQual and B.Health. We have made the dataset publicly available which opens avenues for researchers to employ various intelligent data analysis techniques in order to develop systems capable of automatically assessing sleep quality and behavioral health using digital data without the need of any self-reporting questionnaires and tools.

Many tobacco users discuss their opinions, habits and preferences on social media. This work conceptualizes a framework for targeted health interventions to inform tobacco users about the consequences of tobacco use. We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting protobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets. Algorithmic matching, leveraging the power of peer influence, allows for the systematic delivery of personalized interventions based on real anti-tobacco tweets from former smokers.

Clinical data are the basic staple that feeds intelligent healthcare applications, but due to its sensitive character, its sharing and usage by third parties require compliance with both confidentiality agreements and security measures. Data Anonymization emerges as a solution to both increasing the data privacy and reducing the risk against unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through data modifications. Although the anonymization improves privacy, the diverse modifications also harm the data functional suitability. These data modifications can affect applications that employ the anonymized data, especially those that are data-centric such as the AI tools. To obtain a trade-off between both qualities (privacy and functional suitability), we use the Test-Driven Anonymization (TDA) approach, which anonymizes incrementally the data to train the AI tools and validates with the real data until maximizing its quality. The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset from the Spanish Institute for the Study of the Biology of Human Reproduction (INEBIR). The anonymized datasets are used to train AI tools and select the dataset that gets the best trade-off between privacy and functional quality requirements.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593,Unmanned Systems Health Analysis through Evidential Reasoning Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

10.1109/TASE.2021.3069800,A Decision-Tree-Based Bayesian Approach for Chance-Constrained Health Prevention Budget Rationing,IEEE,Journals,"Medical test selection is a recurring problem in health prevention and consists of proposing a set of tests to each subject for diagnosis and treatment of pathologies. The problem is characterized by the unknown risk probability distribution across the population and two contradictory objectives: minimizing the number of tests and giving the medical test to all at-risk populations. This article sets this problem in a general framework of chance-constrained medical test rationing with unknown subject distribution over an attribute space and unknown risk probability but with a given sample population. A new approach combining decision-tree and Bayesian inference is proposed to allocate relevant medical tests according to the subjects&#x2019; profile. Case studies on screening of hypertension and diabetes are conducted, and the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated. Significant savings on unnecessary tests are achieved with limited numbers of subjects needing but not receiving necessary tests. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;Whether a medical test is needed for all subjects in health prevention? Is it possible to reduce unnecessary tests without jeopardizing the goal of screening at-risk populations? This article attempts to answer these questions by proposing a data-driven approach combining decision trees for subject profiling, Bayesian inference for unknown probability distribution estimation, and combinatorial optimization for test allocation. The application of this approach to a real-case study reduces the number of electrocardiogram (ECG) tests by 90&#x0025; while keeping the number of hypertensive subjects needing but not receiving ECG tests small (five out of 230). A significant cut of unnecessary tests is also achieved in a second case study of diabetes screening. This approach allows decision-makers to better balance the cost-saving and the level of public health objective. Furthermore, the combination with decision trees makes the practical implementation quite straightforward.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9406177/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,July 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data.

However, most existing solutions not only require substantial expertise to conduct feature engineering, but also seldom consider the temporal correlation of sensor sequences, ultimately leading to complex modeling processes. Therefore, we present a novel model, named Attention-based Equitable Segmentation Gated Recurrent Unit Networks (AESGRU), to improve diagnostic accuracy and model-building efficiency. Specifically, our proposed AESGRU consists of two modules, an equitable segmentation approach and an improved deep model. We first transform the original dataset into time-series segments with temporal correlation, so that the model enables end-to-end learning from the strongly correlated data. Then, we deploy a single-layer bidirectional GRU network, which is enhanced by attention mechanism, to capture the long-term dependency of sensor segments and focus limited attention resources on those informative sampling points. Finally, our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous approaches in terms of the accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8847332/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data &#x0026; AI Innovation Awards.

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results.

Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into CPS, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several NCDs.

Most of these studies have focused on predicting failures of hard drives, i.e., labeling the status of a hard drive as “good” or not. However, in real-world storage systems, hard drives often deteriorate gradually rather than suddenly. Correspondingly, their SMART attributes change continuously towards failure. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to assess the health statuses of hard drives based on the gradually changing sequential SMART attributes. Compared to a simple failure prediction method, a health status assessment is more valuable in practice because it enables technicians to schedule the recovery of different hard drives according to the level of urgency. Experiments on real-world datasets for disks of different brands and scales demonstrate that our proposed method can not only achieve a reasonable accurate health status assessment, but also achieve better failure prediction performance than previous work.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7426410/,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1 Nov. 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This revolution delivers a promising solution for the health monitoring problem of the heat pump (HP) system, a vital device widely deployed in modern buildings for heating use, to timely evaluate its operation status to avoid unexpected downtime. Many HPs were practically manufactured and installed many years ago, resulting in fewer sensors available due to technology limitations and cost control at that time. It raises a dilemma to safeguard HPs at an affordable cost. In this article, we propose a hybrid scheme by integrating industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and intelligent health monitoring algorithms to handle this challenge. To start with, an IIoT network is constructed to sense and store measurements. Specifically, temperature sensors are properly chosen and deployed at the inlet and outlet of the water tank to measure water temperature.

Characterized by frequent operation switches of different HPs due to the variable demand for hot water, various heating patterns with different heating speeds are observed. Slowness, a kind of dynamics to measure the varying speed of steady distribution, is properly considered in MSFA for both heating pattern division and health evaluation.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882824,Parsimonious Kernel Recursive Least Squares Algorithm for Aero-Engine Health Diagnosis,IEEE,Journals,"Kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) has gained widespread popularity among the machine learning community for online applications due to its convexity, simplicity, and universal approximation ability. However, the network generated by KAF keeps growing with the accumulation of the training samples, which leads to the increasing memory requirement and computational burden. To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary. The importance of a center is quantified by its contribution to minimizing the cost function. The calculation of the importance measure is formulated in an efficient manner, which facilitates its implementation in online settings. Experimental results on the benchmark tasks show that PKRLS obtains a parsimonious network structure with the satisfactory prediction accuracy. Finally, a multi-sensor health diagnosis approach based on PKRLS is developed for identifying the health state of a degraded aero-engine in realtime. A case study in a turbofan engine degradation data set demonstrates that PKRLS provides an effective and efficient candidate for modeling the performance deterioration of real complex systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8543207/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Despite the significant increase in adoption of EHR systems, these data remain largely unexplored, but present a rich data source for knowledge discovery from patient health histories in tasks, such as understanding disease correlations and predicting health outcomes. However, the heterogeneity, sparsity, noise, and bias in these data present many complex challenges. This complexity makes it difficult to translate potentially relevant information into machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a computational framework, Patient2Vec, to learn an interpretable deep representation of longitudinal EHR data, which is personalized for each patient. To evaluate this approach, we apply it to the prediction of future hospitalizations using real EHR data and compare its predictive performance with baseline methods.

Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld.

It consists of three major stages: the PPG signal quality assessment (PPG-SQA) using autocorrelation function (ACF) and number of threshold-crossings (NTC) features, the zero-frequency resonator (ZFR) based pulse onset and peak determination, and the pulse parameter extraction. The method is implemented on the Arduino Due with a 32-bit Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU, 512-kB flash memory, 96-kB SRAM, and 84-MHz clock speed. The method is evaluated on the recorded PPG signals and three standard PPG databases. The PPG-SQA algorithm achieves an average sensitivity (Se) = 98.62%, specificity (Sp) = 97.37%, and overall accuracy (OA) = 98.09%. The algorithm achieves an average Se = 99.88%, positive predictivity (Pp) = 99.89, Se = 99.82%, and Pp = 99.95%, respectively with the delineation errors (mean ± standard deviation) of 8.45 ± 9.39 ms and 0.23 ± 1.33 ms for finding onsets and peaks, respectively. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the parameter measurement errors are minimum for most of the pulse cycles. Results show that our quality-aware PPG analysis scheme can achieve a false alarm rate reduction (FARR) of 97.36% which outperforms the other existing SQA algorithms.

In this regard, the first part of this paper presents comprehensive maintenance for power transformers aiming to diagnose transformer faults more accurately. Specifically, it aims to identify incipient faults in power transformers using what is known as dissolved gas analysis (DGA) with a new proposed integrated method. This proposed method for DGA is implemented based on the integration among the results of five different DGA techniques; 1) conditional probability, 2) clustering, 3) Duval triangle, 4) Roger’s four ratios refined, and 5) artificial neural network. Accordingly, this proposed integrated DGA method could improve the overall accuracy by 93.6% compared to the existing DGA techniques. In addition, the second part used for predictive maintenance is based on determining the health index for five new transformers and an aged power transformer (66/11 kV, 40 MVA) filled with NYTRO 10XN oil by evaluating the breakdown voltage, DGA, moisture content, and acidity for the oil. In the breakdown voltage test, two practical types of transformer oil; NYTRO 10XN and HyVolt III alongside their mixtures are estimated and compared. In addition, aged oil samples extracted from a real case study in-service transformer during operation with different aged durations; 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 years, are tested for breakdown voltage, and then compared with fresh oil samples. For DGA, a temperature rise test is performed on the five new transformers with a comparison between dissolved gases before and after the temperature rise. In addition, winding resistance is measured after the temperature rise. Also, acidity and moisture are measured for oils extracted from the new five transformers and from the 13-year in-service transformer for studying their health index. The health index of the transformer insulation system is examined using only DGA and DGA plus breakdown voltage (BDV), moisture, and acidity. The results show that by using DGA plus BDV, moisture, and acidity, the health index provides reliable estimation results compared to using only DGA.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9726145/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth.

While existing machine learning models can provide better performance than the previous univariate time-series model, it is still an open challenge of fully mining the spatial and temporal characteristics of the structural response to increase their accuracy. In addition, the heterogeneous correlation is always missed in traditional models. This article proposes a heterogeneous structural response prediction (HSRP) framework based on the deep learning model to improve the performance. The HSRP framework cannot only make full use of spatial and temporal correlations but also mine the correlation between heterogeneous responses. Motivated by recent studies in machine learning, an attention module is introduced to learn the correlation between different responses and initial the weights of sensors and past response. The convolutional neural network is also implemented to extract the spatial features and the long short-term memory network is used to extract the weekly, daily, and hourly patterns of structural response. A real-world data set collected from a bridge is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model on single-step prediction and multistep prediction.

10.1109/JBHI.2018.2836138,Toward a Model for Personal Health Record Interoperability,IEEE,Journals,"Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers.

In general, fault detection and diagnosis techniques for induction motors can be supervised by measuring quantities such as noise, vibration, and temperature. The installation of mechanical sensors in order to assess the health conditions of a machine is typically only done for expensive or load-critical machines, where the high cost of a continuous monitoring system can be justified. Nevertheless, induced current monitoring can be implemented inexpensively on machines with arbitrary sizes by using current transformers. In this regard, effective and low-cost fault detection techniques can be implemented, hence reducing the maintenance and downtime costs of motors. In this work, machine learning techniques have been combined with traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to proposes a simple but yet efficient method for fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors. Raw signals are converted from time domain to frequency domain using FFT. The FFT spectrum are then divided into frequency segments and energy coefficients of each segment are calculated as the sum over the FFT amplitudes. These energy coefficients are used as features for machine learning in our platform. The proposed method is validated on real-world data and achieves a precision of 99.7% for fault detection and 100% for fault classification with minimal expert knowledge requirement.

The non-invasive nature of peripheral physiological signal measurement via wearables enables ecologically valid long-term monitoring. These peripheral signal measurements can be used in real-time in many ways including health and emotion classification. This paper investigates the utility of peripheral physiological signals for emotion recognition using the publicly available DEAP database. Using this database (which contains electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and peripheral signals), this paper compares eight machine learning models in the classification of valence and arousal emotion dimensions. These were applied to the peripheral physiological signals only. These models operate on three groupings of the peripheral data: (i) the raw peripheral physiological signals; (ii) individual feature sets extracted from each peripheral signal; and (iii) a fusion data set made of the combined features from the individual peripheral signals. The results indicate that support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression give the best recognition results on all three data groups considered. The feature fusion data set, which is made up by fusing all the features from the peripheral signals, gives the best recognition accuracy on both valence and arousal dimensions.

Currently, there are three vestibular disorder diagnostic methods including hearing tests, eye movement tests, and balance tests. The first two methods are sensitive and accurate. However, they require complicated and costly equipment. Among balance test methods, observing the body sway in several postures is a good choice when the testing time needs to be shortened; nonetheless, diagnostic results strongly depend on subjective evaluations of doctors. This paper contributes a solution by introducing a computer-aided method for quantitatively measure the degree of swaying. The proposed algorithm can process real time video captured by a camera, detect two colored stickers attached on the shirt, and calculate the inclination of the patient body. Many sub-processes have been utilized to enhance the measurement accuracy and method applicability. Experiments were performed with a mannequin and human bodies. Results show that angles measured by the proposed method and the reference data are almost equal. The plotted results show remarkably differences between healthy volunteers and patients. This means that the proposed system could provide a useful basis for screening and contribute an important step towards applying machine learning in vestibular disorders diagnosis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9352088/,2020 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE),13-15 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, much of this computation for these applications happens in the cloud, but there are several good reasons to perform the processing on local edge platforms such as smartphones: improved accessibility to different parts of the world, low latency, and data privacy. In this paper, we present a general hardware and software co-design framework for energy-efficient edge AI for both simple classification and structured output prediction tasks (e.g., 3D shapes from images). This framework relies on two key ideas. First, we design a space of DNNs of increasing complexity (coarse to fine) and perform input-specific adaptive inference by selecting a DNN of appropriate complexity depending on the hardness of input examples. Second, we execute the selected DNN on the target edge platform using a resource management policy to save energy. We also provide instantiations of our co-design framework for three qualitatively different problem settings: convolutional neural networks for image classification, graph convolutional networks for predicting 3D shapes from images, and generative adversarial networks on photo-realistic unconditional image generation.

It allows to continuously monitor patients without restricting their movements and to inform the health specialist of the evolution of their states. However, the deployment of new technologies in health applications without taking into account data security makes the privacy of patients vulnerable. Thus, these systems have insufficient performance for large and varied data sets, because they do not process information sufficiently diverse to cover all scenarios. Moreover, the interpretation of physiological signals is a tedious process in which human errors can be caused.To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an effective health system that ensures the secure collection and transfer of patient data to the physician, to facilitate the diagnosis and the detection of life threatening diseases.

Fault diagnosis of induction motor is therefore a necessary and crucial task to ensure the machinery health and prevent vital damages. Conventional diagnosis methods are mainly based on intrusive sensors to measure certain physical parameters. However, intrusive sensors are costly and hard to apply to update traditional machines.

The key challenge in early detection of the corona virus is early detection. And the main obstacle was the similarity of COVID-19 symptoms to flu symptoms. With the goal of saving human lives and stemming the spread of a worldwide pandemic, an accurate and speedy analysis of COVID-19-induced pneumonia has now taken centre stage. Responding this urgent concern and to reduce the burden as well as chances of faulty manual diagnosis, several deep learning approaches are developed to conduct early diagnosis. Based on the availability of reliable patient's records, an accepted technique is pre-trained deep learning prediction approach through patient's chest X-Rays. Convenience of this approach led development of a number of novel deep learning-based lung screening technologies. However, little emphasis is placed on ensuring the quality of their output. Pre-trained deep learning systems will be used in this project to evaluate their ability to recognise and diagnose disorders. To categorise COVID and normal pictures, a neural network-based ResNet50 architecture is presented. The implementation is based on the normal, COVID, and lung opacity datasets. For data pre-processing, ImageDataGenerator is used, which rescales, flips, and modifies the range to meet the model. To categorise the x- ray images, the suggested method ResNet50 architecture is used. Performance matrices like precision, accuracy, recall, as well as F1-score are examined to verify the algorithm's usefulness.

Currently, rapidly, accurately and non-destructively diagnostic devices or systems for this disease have not been disclosed. In this study, the infected ears with different severities were picked up in key growth stages. The diseased area of wheat ear was extracted using hypergreen characteristic, and a total of 30 features of infected ears were chosen including color (Lab, HSI, HSV, YCbCr color space), texture (LBP and LLE dimension reduction), and shape (squareness, shape complexity, and eccentricity). Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed. It consists of three parts - Clients, Service-Terminal and Database. The Client was designed by Android Studio and its functions mainly include image acquisition, image storage, GPS positioning, image uploading and diagnostic results display.

The effects of poor or deprived sleep can have a major impact on the daily, healthy functioning of the human body and can lead to serious health issues. Current, prevalent tests can be expensive, cumbersome and not conducive to long-term monitoring of sleep. However, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm offers an inexpensive alternative and can enable long-term, continuous monitoring of sleep. In this work, we tackle the problem of continuous sleep state segmentation in streaming data to temporally localize and recognize the sleep state. We show that predictive learning-based self-supervised representation learning can be used to learn robust features for both supervised and unsupervised sleep state segmentation. We obtain best accuracy of 96.2%(1 patient), an average accuracy of 81.8%(10 patients) on the wake vs sleep classification and best accuracy of 78.9%(1 patient), an average accuracy of 67.3%(10 patients) on the much harder multi-stage sleep classification task.

The MANETs are composed of several ad-hoc nodes that are randomly or deterministically distributed for communication and acquisition and to forward the data to the gateway for enhanced communication securely. MANETs are used in many applications such as in health care for communication; in utilities such as industries to monitor equipment and detect any malfunction during regular production activity. In general, MANETs take measurements of the desired application and send this information to a gateway, whereby the user can interpret the information to achieve the desired purpose. The main importance of MANETs in intrusion detection is that they can be trained to detect intrusion and real-time attacks in the CIC-IDS 2019 dataset. MANETs routing protocols are designed to establish routes between the source and destination nodes. What these routing protocols do is that they decompose the network into more manageable pieces and provide ways of sharing information among its neighbors first and then throughout the whole network.

For pig surveillance applications, separating touching-pigs in real-time is an important issue for a final goal of 24-hour tracking of individual pigs. Although convolutional neural network (CNN)-based instance segmentation techniques can be applied to this separation problem, their collective performance of accuracy-time may not satisfy the required performance. In this study, we improve the collective performance of accuracy-time by combining the fastest CNN-based object detection technique (i.e., You Only Look Once, YOLO) with image processing techniques. We first apply image processing techniques to detect touching-pigs by using both infrared and depth information acquired from an Intel RealSense camera, then apply YOLO to separate the touching-pigs. Especially, in using YOLO as an object detector, we consider the target object as the boundary region of the touching-pigs, rather than the individual pigs of the touching-pigs. Finally, we apply image processing techniques to determine the final boundary line from the YOLO output.

The fail safe operation of a safety critical system like battery operated car or any other lifesaving systems are heavily depend upon earlier prediction of battery life. SOC or State-of-Charge estimation is one of the well-known method to predict the runtime of a battery. Various approaches are adapted by automotive society to correctly predict the runtime or the SOC of a battery like Kalman filter, UKF and many others. This paper proposes a new approach, the method of regression to predict the future power demand of a car while running on the road. The aim is to identify that, the battery will support the run of the car in next 10 seconds or not. The runtime prediction of a battery, not only depends upon the starting SOC but also depends upon other factors like battery health and road profile imposed. To overcome this type of difficulties the self-corrective regression model is proposed and implemented. Experiments performed on different road profiles, validate demanded power by the car in up-coming 10 seconds of its run. The major problem of SoC estimation is to determine initial SoC of a battery. Extensive experiments needed to calculate the initial SoC and which may also vary with the life of the battery. The novelty of this work shows, the method to predict the future power demand by updating its model parameters and without any initial SoC calculation.

Quantifying concentrations of aerosols, particularly near the surface, is foundational to the understanding of the sources, evolution, and transport of PM2.5 and will help to support environmental justice for communities across America and the world. Moreover, developing improved algorithms to accurately invert or retrieve surface-level PM2.5 from satellite remote sensing is critical to improve neighborhood-scale estimates of air quality [3]. In particular, past and future satellite polarimeter and lidar measurements will be key to understanding surface-level PM2.5 conditions in real-time across the globe. A current solution to the retrieval of accurate aerosol properties from satellite polarimeter measurements has been developed by NASA for the Plankton, Aerosols, Clouds and Ecosystems mission (PACE) mission in the form of the Micro-physical Aerosol Properties from Polarimetry (PACE-MAPP) algorithm [4]. However, because solving the vector radiative transfer is numerically intensive, and solving the non-linear inverse problem requires an iterative approach that for multiple channels involves hundreds of vector radiative transfer calls, this approach delivers products at a rate that has latencies too large for and is prohibitively inefficient for the large-scale datasets that will be needed to resolve PM2.5 at neighborhood-scale resolutions of less than 1 km by 1 km. PACE-MAPP solves this problem by developing a neural network framework to replace the complex and time-consuming vector radiative transfer calculations at each iteration. In this study, we apply the PACE-MAPP framework to polarimetry data gathered from the POLDER instrument (PO-Larization and Directionality of the Earth&#x0027;s Reflectances) [5] onboard PARASOL, a satellite that flew from 2006 to 2013 as a part of efforts to understand the effects of clouds and aerosols on the Earth&#x0027;s climate [6] [7], and demonstrate for the first time ever that a neural-network-based approach using coupled atmosphere-ocean vector radiative transfer can be applied to retrieve aerosol properties from satellite polarimeter data, and to take the first step toward evaluating the algorithm&#x0027;s performance at producing air quality products such as PM2.5.

Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to discover features and specific patterns that can differentiate between partial discharges and noise. On-line PD monitoring systems have been recently deployed for continuously assessing the equipment health, so that its maintenance requires minimal cost and shorter disruption to operational services. However, labelled data is required in order to build predictive models for on-line PD monitoring. Labelled data is expensive to obtain since it requires expert input. In addition, in real scenarios the ratio of noise pulses to real PDs can be high, making the learning task harder. This paper investigates an active learning (AL) approach for streaming data that aims to maintain an on-line model that is robust to class imbalances. The empirical evaluation, using real HFCT sensor data, shows that the proposed AL approach is able to achieve over 80% accuracy in noisy scenarios with minimal expert dependence (only 2% of the labelled instances).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7551566/,2016 17th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),13-16 June 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The use of Clinical Pathways is an emerging solution for that problem. However, current Clinical Pathways are big manuals written in natural language and highly affected by human subjectivity. These problems make the deployment and dissemination of them extremely difficult in real practice environments. In this work, a complete computer based architecture to help the representation and execution of Clinical Pathways is suggested. Furthermore, the difficulties inherent to the design of formal Clinical Pathways in this way requires new specific design tools to help making the system useful. Process Mining techniques can help to automatically infer processes definition from execution samples. Yet, the classical Process Mining paradigm is not totally compatible with the Clinical Pathways paradigm.

10.1109/ICCAD45719.2019.8942124,Adar: Adversarial Activity Recognition in Wearables,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent advances in machine learning and deep neural networks have led to the realization of many important applications in the area of personalized medicine. Whether it is detecting activities of daily living or analyzing images for cancerous cells, machine learning algorithms have become the dominant choice for such emerging applications. In particular, the state-of-the-art algorithms used for human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable inertial sensors utilize machine learning algorithms to detect health events and to make predictions from sensor data. Currently, however, there remains a gap in research on whether or not and how activity recognition algorithms may become the subject of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first strides on (1) investigating methods of generating adversarial example in the context of HAR systems; (2) studying the vulnerability of activity recognition models to adversarial examples in feature and signal domain; and (3) investigating the effects of adversarial training on HAR systems. We introduce Adar11Software code and experimental data for Adar are available online at https://github.com/rameshKrSah/Adar., a novel computational framework for optimization-driven creation of adversarial examples in sensor-based activity recognition systems. Through extensive analysis based on real sensor data collected with human subjects, we found that simple evasion attacks are able to decrease the accuracy of a deep neural network from 95.1% to 3.4% and from 93.1% to 16.8% in the case of a convolutional neural network. With adversarial training, the robustness of the deep neural network increased on the adversarial examples by 49.1% in the worst case while the accuracy on clean samples decreased by 13.2%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8942124/,2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD),4-7 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICTer51097.2020.9325474,Adjusting The Hard Level on Game by a Prediction for Improving Attraction and Business Value,IEEE,Conferences,"The computer gaming industry has become more popular among the young generation over the years. It became a sport and According to past studies, people choose computer games over physical games (outdoor games) due to their busy lifestyles which crack social relationships and fear of injuries. There are around 2.2 billion gamers around the world. Out of the assessed 7.6 billion individuals living on earth, as of July 2018, that implies nearly 33% of individuals on this planet are gamers. Out of those 2.2 billion gamers, 1.2 billion of the players play PC game. An online survey was conducted to collect information from random game players and non-game players scattered throughout Sri Lanka to identify the problems faced by them when playing the games and why others do not play the game or are discouraged to play games. 354 participants participated in this survey. In which 127 of the participants were Female and 227 Male. The participation age range was identified as 15 to 49 Years. The research team was able to summarize that 80.04% of the participants play games while 19.06% don't play games. Out of the participants who play games, 9.08% are pro players while the rest of the 78% of players are intermediate players. We identified that the main problems faced by most of the players are as follows: Some missions are too easy and boring or players getting stuck in the middle of the level because the level is too hard or because the mission is too hard to complete. The Popularity of games can be varied according to the players' skill level. Tasks of a game can be boring if it's too easy for a skilled player. On the other hand, if it's too hard for a beginner level player, it may tend to give up the game. The other problem identified was the inability of game character customization as per the preference of 92.07% of gamers who participated in the survey. According to their responses, we were able to understand the problems that they faced while playing the game and what they expect in a game. Therefore, the research team proposes a game that changes the level of hardness/complexity of the level according to the players' mood automatically. In simple terms, the game will `adjust and adopt' based on the user's emotions. The next level will be automatically designed based on the player record of the previous level using an algorithm that takes the emotions as inputs. To achieve this, the gamer's heart pulse rate, facial expression, and speed of using the controls are captured and analysed to obtain the most accurate emotion level of the player using machine learning. The level of emotions is taken along with the parameters such as age, gender, and haptic feedback to adjust the hardness level of the level.It is important to identify the player skill level to understand the user's experience as a gamer. To determine a player's skill level in the background, a keylogger captures the pressed key and the time it takes to press the key. It is also necessary to identify the emotional state of the player to provide a unique user experience to the player and it can be done in two ways which are facial expression and heart-pulse. Facial expression detection results in identifying and predicting the basic emotions of an individual such as happiness, anger, and neutral which will be necessary for the adaptive game, and also the emotional range of a player is predicted. Additionally, age, gender, and face-shape are determined. The dataset is trained using machine learning to detect the facial expression and identify the emotion, age, gender, and face-shape of the individual. The Facial Expression of the player will be captured in real-time from the web camera of the computer and the emotion will be identified automatically as well as the age gender and face-shape. The other method is through Heart pulse, Heart pulse also can be used to detect the emotions of the player. There are 3 types of emotion levels Happy, Fear, Neutral. To do this, the heart rate sensor is used to capture the player's heart rate. According to the output received after training the dataset using machine learning algorithms and the skill level output is used to adjust the level of the game while the gamer is playing the game. To obtain a much more accurate emotional level, the heartbeat level, and the facial emotional level are analysed together. We have created a new model for analysing the above data using linear regression. Using the said model, the gender, age, the skill level of the player as well as the difficulty in the level of the game can be identified. The next level of the game will be designed using the data from the previous level and this process will continue until the player quits the game. A model is trained by using machine learning technology to predict character characteristics (moving speed, health regenerating) of the game character. The difficulty level of the player is taken as input for the training process. The output characteristics are given by an in-game module and adjust the characteristics of the game character until the player quits playing. The AI algorithm performs the process of reflecting the characteristics of the player to the in-game character. Age, gender, and face-shape are used as input data. The algorithm process input data to generate a unique set of variables. The variables manipulate the appearance of the in-game character until the player quits playing. Our game is developed within three months; therefore, it is difficult to predict the emotions or obtain a skill level like in an existing commercialized game because the demo game doesn't evoke any emotions or measure the skill level of the player. So, we have tested our application with the other similar existing games and we were able to obtain an accurate emotion and skill level. Even though the game is designed in a way to change the levels and character abilities based on the inputs obtained, we can't do so in other existing games. Therefore, the player records obtained from the games we tested were taken into a text record and analysed separately. Based on the analysed data we were able to obtain an accuracy level of 68%.In the future, the demo game will be further developed and tested with our system to obtain an emotion. The option of changing the game character based on the player's appearance is 75% successful, in which face-shape and gender were used. In the future, we will be using age as well. In the future a profile can be designed based on skill level, therefore making it possible to adjust the game based on a player's past record.This system provides a solution to problems faced by the game players such as the game being too easy and boring or hard and stressful. This can also prevent health issues that can be caused when a person gets too angry or violent and stress.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325474/,2020 20th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer),4-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As time went by, the farmers started using herbicides to kill the weeds. The excessive usage of weedicides can cause severe health problems to the agricultural workers/farmers, can also contaminate the soil and the water. New methods have to be introduced to reduce the usage of weedicide. Even after the advancement in research, a lot of readily available solutions are not being implemented at the grass-root level. Addressing the problem, a better solution has been proposed to minimize the usage of the herbicide by classifying the plant images into the weed and the crop for selective spraying of the herbicide. The first step towards it is to differentiate between the crops and the weed. Image Classification Technique has been implemented using the Deep Learning function. A maximum efficiency of 96.3% was achieved with just 250 images of each plant in the dataset.

Many researchers have drawn attention and have focused about these problems keeping in mind human health. Air quality prediction information is one of the better ways through which people can be informed to be more vigilant about serious health issues and protect human health caused by air pollution. In many metropolitan cities air pollution is a major challenging environmental issue. To analyze the present traffic condition of the city, local authorities can be enabled by real time monitoring of pollution data which makes appropriate decisions. Hence an early system is required for monitoring and calculating the level of AP using Air Quality (AQ) which is essential for predicting exactly the pollutant concentrations. The prediction of AQ can be improved by deploying Internet of Things (IoT) based sensor which are considerably changing the prediction of AQ dynamically. The prediction of AP discussed and estimated using many existing techniques are very expensive and have very low accuracy. The technological advancement of Machine Learning (ML) algorithm can be very fast increasing and searching almost all fields and applications whereas AP prediction has not prohibited from those fields. This paper describes about various studies of ML algorithm relating to AP prediction and monitoring based on the IoT sensor data in the context of various cities.

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing.

With the rise of artificial intelligence deep learning in recent years, various analytical software resources have gradually become easier to obtain. At the same time, wearable cyber physical sensors are becoming more and more popular. Measurements on vital signs such as heartbeat, electrocardiogram, and blood oxygenation blood pressure values are ubiquitous. We propose an integrated system that combines dialysis big data deep learning analysis with cross platform physiological sensing. We specifically tackle the early warning of dialysis discomfort such as hypotension, hypertension, cramps, etc., this requires a large amount of data collection, related training, data sources including dialysis treatment process and home physiological data. Although the Dialysis machine is able to produce huge amount of IoT data, the usable data for early warning system training is not as huge due to the limited physician labors devoted for labeling questionable samples. This generally leads to low accuracy for regular CNN training methods. We enhance the AI training performance via a transfer learning technique. The AI training accuracy reaches the value of 99% with the help of transfer learning, while that of an original CNN process on the HD data bears a low 60% accuracy. Given the high prediction accuracy of our AI engine, we are able to integrate the real time measurements from Dialysis machine with wearable devices such as ECG sensors and wrist health watches, and make precision prediction of incoming discomfort during the HD treatments.

Water pollution is a major environmental problem in India. The largest source of water pollution in India is untreated sewage. Other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small scale industry that results in polluting, most of the rivers, lakes and surface water in India. In this paper, An IoT Based Smart Water Quality Monitoring System using Cloud and Deep Learning is proposed to monitor the quality of the water in water-bodies. In conventional systems, the monitoring process involves the manual collection of sample water from various regions, followed by laboratory testing and analysis.

This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time. We test the solution with the specific application of ECG monitoring and abnormality reporting. We analyze the performance of the implemented system in terms of response time by varying the velocity and volume of the analyzed data. We also discuss how the cloud resources should be provisioned in order to guarantee processing performance for both long-term and real-time scenarios. To ensure a good tradeoff between cost and processing performance, resources provision should be adapted to the exact needs and characteristics of the considered application.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8734185/,2019 3rd International Conference on Bio-engineering for Smart Technologies (BioSMART),24-26 April 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such information is critical to ensure proper distribution of products to the market and eliminate health risks due to erroneous mislabelling. The latter is considerably detrimental to both consumers and suppliers alike. In this paper, an adaptable deep learning based system is proposed and tested across various possible scenarios: a) for the identification of blurry images and/or missing information from food packaging photos. These were captured during the validation process in supply chains; b) for deep neural network adaptation. This was achieved through a novel methodology that utilises facets of the same convolutional neural network architecture. Latent variables were extracted from different datasets and used as input into a Λ-means clustering and Λ-nearest neighbour classification algorithm, to compute a new set of centroids which better adapts to the target dataset's distribution. Furthermore, visualisation and analysis of network adaptation provides insight into how higher accuracy was achieved when compared to the original deep neural network.

The traditional manual sorting method not only has high labor costs, but also can cause physical harm and threaten the health of practitioners when it comes into contact with hazardous waste. Therefore, it is of great research significance to improve the autonomy, intelligence and practical application of waste sorting. In the specific application of garbage classification, it is restricted by the hardware of edge devices, and it is necessary to meet the requirements of detection accuracy and reduction of computing power consumption at the same time. Therefore, this paper adopts the light YOLOv3-SPP network to classify garbage. Specifically, this paper first builds a garbage detection dataset, and then uses the dataset to train the YOLOv3-SPP network to form a YOLOv3-SPP garbage detection model. Next, model compression is performed on the YOLOv3-SPP garbage detection model using channel pruning and layer pruning, and the compressed model can be directly deployed on the low-computing edge computing device carried in the robot that automatically sorts and recycles garbage, so as to realize the miniaturization and large-scale practical application of the garbage sorting robot. The experimental results show that after model compression, the size and inference time of the model drop by 90.77&#x0025; and 72.93&#x0025;, respectively, while the mAP of the model only drops by 3.92&#x0025;.

In order to enable real time onboard diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, mechanisms for reading, manipulating and analyzing the data need to be architected into the onboard system. Machine learning and statistical algorithms provide tools to develop data models for enabling prognostics that are typically developed off-board by mining historical data. Once trained, the logic of processing real time data is then embedded on a real time onboard system. A straightforward approach for incorporating the knowledge and intelligence for real time data processing is to add the needed logic and algorithms as an integral part of the onboard software. While this method can serve the purpose of enabling real time health assessment and analysis, it is very restrictive in nature. Every time the analytics need to be updated or algorithms need refinement, it requires a refresh of the complete onboard software. The ability to fine tune onboard embedded logic for the purpose of making the analysis smarter is crucial for creating a successful and sound health monitoring system. In addition, it is desired that the process of encoding logic and algorithms should be simple and easy to incorporate into the system. User friendliness of the process of embedding intelligent logic is critical for long term maintenance of the system as well. This paper discusses an approach to build algorithms and logic into an onboard system such that they are programmatically decoupled from the onboard software. The approach described in this paper allows users the ease of use and flexibility in building knowledge into the system. In addition, as more historical data is collected and richer knowledge is discovered from mining the data, algorithms can be improved over time without having to update the onboard software.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7118976/,2015 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper deals with the analysis of different blood cells using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework and has been trained with a dataset of blood smear images taken from BCCD (Blood Cell Count and Detection). Diseases such as dengue, bone marrow disorder, thyroid condition, iron deficiency require blood cell count for the diagnosis.

Structural members are considerably affected by several loadings imposed by normal operation, disaster and environment. Proper inspection and detection are thus crucial both during regular and unsafe events. An Enhanced Structural Health Monitoring System Using Stream Processing and Artificial Neural Network Techniques (SPANNeT) has been developed, tested and evaluated. SPANNeT applies wireless sensor network, real-time data stream processing and artificial neural network based upon the measured bending strains. Off-the-shelf sensor platform including strain gauge, data logger and base station were employed. Like other wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, several limitations based upon the resource constraint are recognized and additional restrictions are unforeseen. Several experiences learned from applying SPANNeT to an existing bridge structure in Bangkok, Thailand are described in this paper. Adaptations were conducted to the strain gauge to avoid inaccurate readings due to the non-uniform texture of the concrete. Furthermore, the distance between strain gauge and data logger was increased by using electrical cable to overcome device installation restriction and to tackle battery recharge problems. Even the distance between data logger and base station was decreased, completely reliable data delivery could not be achieved. At least 90% of successful data communication was observed.

Identifying patients with high readmission risk and paying additional attention to them can ease the burden on both patients and society. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to personalized readmission predictions, i.e., building an independent model for each target patient. However, existing personalized predictive models can be easily affected by data insufficiency and provide poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose the CLusterbased mUlti-task lEarning model (CLUE) to achieve personalized hospital readmission prediction. CLUE groups patients into different clusters based on a multi-angle similarity metric to preserve the interrelated information of patients with highly similar clinical behaviors. Due to different group characteristics of patients, the clusters of patients are imbalanced. Given that, CLUE treats the hospital readmission prediction for each cluster of patients as one task and learns multiple tasks jointly by parameter sharing mechanisms. In this way, not only can the data insufficiency problem be alleviated by supplementing individual models with the shared information from other clusters, but also the specific information of each cluster can be preserved for personalization.

One application that is particularly relevant in today's digital era is the alignment of scanned or camera-captured document images such as insurance claim forms for information extraction. Traditional learning based approaches perform poorly due to the absence of an appropriate gradient. Feature based keypoint extraction techniques for homography estimation in real scene images either detect an extremely large number of inconsistent keypoints due to sharp textual edges, or produce inaccurate keypoint correspondences due to variations in illumination and viewpoint differences between document images. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for aligning scanned or camera-captured document images using character based keypoints and a reference template. The algorithm is both fast and accurate and utilizes a standard Optical character recognition (OCR) engine such as Tesseract to find character based unambiguous keypoints, which are utilized to identify precise keypoint correspondences between two images.

Considering these aspects, the solution proposed in this research is a real time computer vision-based system that monitors behavior and detects anomalies through deep learning. The monitoring is mainly focused on detecting unusual behavior including falls, and monitoring routine activities to detect deviations. A device approach is used to deploy the deep learning models and consists of IP camera-based monitoring which uses a special privacy protected procedure that ensures the detection is done based on meta data and therefore no camera image or footage is stored. The research is mainly focused on four major components which are user identification, fall detection, routine variance detection and device configuration.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9613448/,2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA ),7-10 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Town councils have to regularly collect different types of wastes to clean cities/towns. Hence managing the waste of the cities is a challenging task. However, most of the urban councils currently use a manual approach to managing waste. However, it results in many difficulties for the people and cleaning staff who involve in the process by following strict guidelines. Issues due to waste contamination, no proper information management of waste collection, and no punctuality in removing waste from the garbage bins are some of the significant issues arising from the manual process. Due to the drawbacks of the manual approach, social issues, environmental issues, health issues can occur easily. This paper proposes a better solution to replace this manual system with an automated system to overcome these issues. Hence, the main objective of this research is to introduce an ICT-based innovative design that can be used to develop an effective waste management system in town councils. In the proposed model, we will introduce a Computer Vision-based smart waste bin system with real-time monitoring that incorporates various technologies such as computer vision, sensor-based IoT devices, and geographical information system (GIS) related technologies. Our proposed solution consists of a waste bin system, which is capable of automated waste segregation. Our design facilitates the admin users to expand the waste bin kit by adding more waste categories in a user-friendly manner, making our product adaptive in any environment. At the same time, waste bins can notify the real-time waste status. Our system generates the optimum collection routing path and displays it in a mobile app using those real-time status details.

The effectiveness of antibodies is affected by the health and clinical history of donors, according to research.

These platforms allow humans to interact with machines through sensing, control and actuation functions in ways not imaginable a few decades ago. While robust control techniques aim to maintain autonomous system performance in the presence of bounded modeling errors, they are not designed to manage large multi- parameter variations and internal component failures that are inevitable during lengthy periods of field deployment. To address the trustworthiness of autonomous systems in the field, we propose a cross-layer error resilience approach in which errors are detected and corrected at appropriate levels of the design (hardware-through software) with the objective of minimizing the latency of error recovery while maintaining high failure coverage. At the control processor level, soft errors in the digital control processor are considered. At the system level, sensor and actuator failures are analyzed. These impairments define the health of the system. A methodology for adapting the control procedure of the autonomous system to compensate for degraded system health is proposed.

10.1109/IPSN54338.2022.00011,DRLIC: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Irrigation Control,IEEE,Conferences,"Agricultural irrigation is a major consumer of freshwater. Current irrigation systems used in the field are not efficient, since they are mainly based on soil moisture sensors&#x0027; measurement and growers&#x0027; experience, but not future soil moisture loss. It is hard to predict soil moisture loss, as it depends on a variety of factors, such as soil texture, weather and plants&#x0027; characteristics. To improve irrigation efficiency, this paper presents DRLIC, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based irrigation system. DRLIC uses a neural network (DRL control agent) to learn an optimal control policy that takes both current soil moisture measurement and future soil moisture loss into account. We define an irrigation reward function that facilitates the control agent to learn from past experience. Sometimes, our DRL control agent may output an unsafe action (e.g., irrigating too much water or too little). To prevent any possible damage to plants&#x0027; health, we adopt a safe mechanism that leverages a soil moisture predictor to estimate each action&#x0027;s performance. If it is unsafe, we will perform a relatively-conservative action instead. Finally, we develop a real-world irrigation system that is composed of sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We deploy DRLIC in our testbed composed of six almond trees. Through a IS-day in-field experiment, we find that DRLIC can save up to 9.52&#x0025; of water over a widely-used irrigation scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9826018/,2022 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN),4-6 May 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, wearable devices having real-time cardiac health monitoring aids individuals as well as medical professionals in the timely diagnosis of fatal heart diseases, such as arrhythmia. This paper proposes a low power VLSI architecture that facilitates the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) into normal and other seven types of arrhythmia beats using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Unlike the existing methods for heartbeat classification, in which handcrafted ECG features are utilised, the proposed design leverages DNN for the classification of arrhythmia using a complete ECG beat. This obviates the need to extract ECG features separately and, produces an accurate and power optimised design for arrhythmia classification. Evaluation of the proposed methodology on the MIT-BIH dataset exhibits the accuracy and specificity of 97.01 % and 99.09%, respectively, which is comparable or better with respect to other algorithms implemented on software or ASIC based platforms. The proposed architecture is realised at 180nm CMOS technology having 0.624mm2 area and exhibits 6.82× less power consumption at 1kHz as compared to others methods.

A particularly contentious issue was lockdown orders issued by state governments designed to keep citizens safe by controlling the spread of the virus. To compel the government to relax these orders and restore normalcy, antilockdown protests were organized in many states. The economic, ideological, political, and health concerns related to the lockdowns and the associated protests were debated vigorously on social media platforms, many times using offensive content. Detecting such insulting and humiliating content is especially important during tumultuous times, when tensions are high, because such expressions online can quickly precipitate violence in the physical world. This paper presents an approach to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds collected after anti-lockdown protests in Lansing, Michigan. These tweets were labeled using a comprehensive definition of what constitutes offensive content based on its potential to trigger and incite people. Linguistic and auxiliary features were extracted from these labeled tweets. These features were further processed through feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The preprocessed feature set was used to train machine learning models, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of around 84%. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and tagging offensive content in politically motivated situations, even when such speech is dominated by contextual and circumstantial information. It can thus be used to mitigate the damage caused by widespread dissemination of offensive content.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9529358/,"2021 IEEE 45th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",12-16 July 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This system can help reduce traffic accidents and save the lives of drivers. This work trains a Convolutional Neural Network and uses it to assess whether the driver&#x0027;s eyes are closed or open. The dataset comprises images acquired from a large portion of the MRL eye dataset. Before training, the proposed model processes the images in the dataset using computer vision techniques such as edge detection, grayscale conversion, and dilation. The Google MediaPipe Face mesh model is then used to track facial landmarks from video frames in real-time. The eyes region is retrieved, processed, and fed to the proposed trained model for prediction. The model detects drowsiness and alarms the driver to take safety measures. This paper proposes and implements a CNN model that achieves an overall accuracy of 95&#x0025;, outperforming all previous studies on drowsiness detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9777182/,2022 6th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI),28-30 April 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The introduction of auto milking systems makes management of farms and udder health more efficient and auto detection systems for common diseases in dairy farms, which are implemented auto milking systems and detect the diseases based on some measurements while milking, are needed. In this study, we propose a novel model for subclinical mastitis detection. Our dataset was collected from dairy farms in Japan and labeled using risk values calculated by a commercially available milk analyzer based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in order to train our model. Several measurements that can be obtained from any auto milking system, such as electrical conductivity in milk, were used as time series features. The models were trained using machine learning (a support vector machine or random forest) and their performances were compared. Our model detects the onset of subclinical mastitis with an accuracy of 81% in terms of sensitivity and 46% precision. In addition, some cases of subclinical mastitis can be detected earlier than when using an alert system based on LDH.

Such monitoring systems are becoming available nowadays due to recent advancements in Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigms, enabling ubiquitous monitoring. These systems require a high level of quality in attributes such as availability and accuracy due to patients critical conditions in the monitoring. Deep learning methods are very promising in such health applications to obtain a satisfactory performance, where a considerable amount of data is available. These methods are perfectly positioned in the cloud servers in a centralized cloud-based IoT system. However, the response time and availability of these systems highly depend on the quality of Internet connection. On the other hand, smart gateway devices are unable to implement deep learning methods (such as training models) due to their limited computational capacities. In our previous work, we proposed a hierarchical computing architecture (HiCH), where both edge and cloud computing resources were efficiently exploited, allocating heavy tasks of a conventional machine learning method to the cloud servers and outsourcing the hypothesis function to the edge. Due to this local decision making, the availability of the system was highly improved. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of deploying the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification model as an example of deep learning methods in this architecture.

Conventional methods such as moving average or autoregressive analysis normally require the assumption of stationarity, which is often violated in epidemiologic time series.

We deploy an additive fuzzy system into a neural network architecture in order to incorporate recurrent nodes to enable the fuzzy system to handle temporal data. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the fuzzy rule structure before supervised training is applied to adjust parameters. As epidemiological time series exhibit complex behavior and possibly cyclic patterns, the addition of recurrent nodes to the fuzzy system improves the modeling capability.

Failure indicators are characteristics of internal states and behavior of a system which indicate potential failures. However, previous studies mostly focused on extracting failure indicators from network and hardware outside of a software system or operating system level, neglected the runtime dynamics on application level. Besides, most of these studies aimed at detecting and predicting performance-related failures. As a major category of software failures, content failures are often omitted. This paper proposes an experiment-based approach to extract interaction-related failure indicators on application level for content failures, composed of abnormal execution time of modules and abnormal interaction times between modules. Firstly, an experiment-based failure data generation method is proposed due to a lack of real-world failure data which can reflect the runtime states and behavior of a software system. Then a machine learning method is selected and applied on the failure dataset to construct classifiers for normal data and failure data, from which failure indicators are extracted. Finally, three open-source software were selected to show the validity of our extracting method and the effectiveness of the extracted failure indicators. Interaction-related failure indicators extracted by the proposed approach can be used for runtime failure detection and prediction of content failures, thus improving runtime dependability of complex software-intensive systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8539208/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW),15-18 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Ontologies are the key to achieve and improve healthcare interoperability, in the form of a permanent artefact of the specification of each of the medical concepts. However, since different ontologies may have contradicting or overlapping parts, the need for the creation of ontology matching techniques for identifying similarities between them is rising. In the meantime, a large number of ontologies, vocabularies and taxonomies, as well as medical standards are constructed and globally adopted (e.g. HL7 FHIR), without promising the existence of a single global ontology, any time soon. Thus, a substantial overhaul of methodology is required to address the real complexity of health.

The collaborative work has built on BAE SYSTEMS' vast advanced technology experience and on Smiths' unique experience that has produced intelligent Fleet and Usage Management Software (FUMSTM ) including fusion, prognostic and decision support algorithms combining model-based and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper describes the recent advances and optimisation of the Smiths algorithms for damage detection and Operational Load Monitoring (OLM). A combination of FUMSTM signal processing and AI techniques have been applied to acoustic emission sensor data to locate and classify damage of different types in composite and metallic structures. The FUMSTM damage detection software has been embedded in real-time hardware to support ground tests. Techniques have been implemented to enable adequate calibration of OLM algorithms using data from flight tests. The techniques should address concerns raised about the accuracy of algorithms trained to synthesise strains throughout the entire flight envelope from data recorded close to the edge of the flight envelope.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications.

This paper proposes new hard drive failure prediction models based on Classification and Regression Trees, which perform better in prediction performance as well as stability and interpretability compared with the state-of the-art model, the Back propagation artificial neural network model.

10.1109/ICAECT49130.2021.9392459,Highly Accurate Real time human Counter with Minimum Computation Cost,IEEE,Conferences,"During the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic when we need to operate any public facility like museum, shopping mall, restaurants, or public dealing organizations, we not only need to keep the operations going but also have to ensure precautionary measures to ascertain their safety. As per all SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) it is advisable to restrict number of visitors inside these enclosed spaces which are most likely to be weather controlled. Automatic safety compliance thus becomes imperative in such situations. Even though absolute compliance and alert signalling will require scrutiny and cross-checking at several levels, a beginning towards automation of compliance monitoring seems mandatory in the neo-normal era. Hence In this project we have designed a low cost rapidly implementable design to monitor the number of visitors inside the self-contained hall. The system will give signal once the maximum permissible visitor population is reached at a given time. Monitoring the optimal population and the density and enforcing visitor to wear mask even within the space manually is tantamount to imposing health hazards to the person who will physically have to monitor and it may as well render the visitors vulnerable. Here we have used Artificial Intelligence based model person detection and tracking. Real time tracking with accuracy is still an important area in computer vision. There are some commercial solution available for the problem but all of them either implemented considering ideal situation or need huge cost and infrastructure. But as a part of museums community we are passing through a financial crises as due to pandemic we closed for visitors. Hence neither we can afford costly system nor a system designed with ideal condition. This motivates us to develop a new system according to our criteria. Here we have modified the available solution for implementation in real world environment using very minimum hardware infrastructure requirements to work on real time with maximum possible efficiency. This system is not only useful for COVID-19 Situation but also its use can be extended beyond the boundary of museums for visitor density monitoring system for large public establishment with minimum computation cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9392459/,"2021 International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Computing, Communication and Sustainable Technologies (ICAECT)",19-20 Feb. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Sensors embedded in modern mobile phones enable unobtrusive detection of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Various statistical and deep learning techniques for the automated detection of human activity have been presented recently. In this study, we have collected accelerometry data through a mobile phone carried by a user for number of days to classify ADL on the basis of exhibited movement into stationary, light ambulatory, intense ambulatory and abnormal classes. ADL such as walking, sitting and jogging etc. are performed and classified simultaneously by mobile phone application and users for comparative analysis. Collected data is given as an input to the trained model and analyzed by implementing the J48 classifier. Results reveal an accuracy score of around 70% for each activity class and it is noted that the classification was performed with an accuracy of above 80% for stationary activity. It is shown that ADL can be recognized with high accuracy using accelerometry data collected in a constrained environment and a single sensor. J48 classifier also correctly classified activities that have a strong correlation between them such as sitting on a chair and standing in stationary position.

Human trait analysis and identification is a field of research that needs a strong implementation for machine learning. Human trait analysis provides a tool with which human identification factors can be verified. Currently, detail aspects of human behavior are digitally and continuously logged in Big Data based platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. This continuous flow of high-volume data requires sophisticated data analysis to examine huge amounts of behavioral evidence so that human traits can be modeled. This paper proposes an innovative technique for human trait analysis that fits the needs for user's identity verification. The pioneering work of this technique is in the distinction of the normal and abnormal actions of the users, where the focus is given to these abnormal actions to establish security potential profiles. The data analysis and prediction of the proposed technique is based on the concept of machine learning and uses several models based on four techniques; K-means, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Auto-Encoder Neural Network, and Gaussian Distribution. Experiments have been carried out in four main phases: prediction of rare user actions, filter security potential actions, build/update a user profile, and generate a real-time (i.e. just in time) set of challenging questions. Real-world scenarios are considered to demonstrate the benefits of these challenging questions in building secure knowledge-based user authentication systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9297188/,"2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",20-22 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Collaborative end-edge-cloud computing for deep learning provides a range of performance and efficiency that can address application requirements through computation offloading. The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). Identifying optimal orchestration considering the cross-layer opportunities and requirements in the face of varying system dynamics is a challenging multi-dimensional problem. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have been proposed earlier, they suffer from a large number of trial-and-errors during the learning process resulting in excessive time and resource consumption. We present a Hybrid Learning orchestration framework that reduces the number of interactions with the system environment by combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Our Deep Learning inference orchestration strategy employs reinforcement learning to find the optimal orchestration policy. Furthermore, we deploy Hybrid Learning (HL) to accelerate the RL learning process and reduce the number of direct samplings. We demonstrate efficacy of our HL strategy through experimental comparison with state-of-the-art RL-based inference orchestration, demonstrating that our HL strategy accelerates the learning process by up to 166.6&#x00D7;.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9806291/,2022 23rd International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED),6-7 April 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions. The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies in the encoded air pollutant data for PM2.5 concentration forecasting.

Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160454/,"2015 38th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)",25-29 May 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The virus was identified a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 20. And also more than 200 countries have been affected by the outbreak, with more than 37 million cases reported and over 1 million fatalities as of 10 October 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus triggered the COVID-19 disease. The human respiratory system deteriorates from this severe disease. In the first four to ten days after infection, patients with COVID-19 may develop symptoms similar to pneumonia as well as other respiratory diseases. As a reason, there could be a misdiagnosis between COVID-19 and common pneumonia patients. So for that, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system can be considered an effective technique for physicians to use medical imaging methods to help the detection of pneumonia and COVID-19. Method: Some methods of deep learning can assist doctors in achieving an accurate pre-diagnosis. This paper proposed a specific and precise method for classification of pneumonia, COVID- 19 and healthy patients using x-ray images, even in the case of a small number of labeled samples being available. EfficientNet-B4 is used to train &#x0026; predict precise result it is a transfer learning approach. To bring the proposed model to reality, additional layers are added to the EfficientNet-B4 model. Results: The proposed work has procured a high training accuracy of 99&#x0025; by 3886 (1200:COVID-19, 1345: pneumonia and 1341: healthy) X-ray images.

PEMFC are promising source of renewable energy that can operate on low temperature and have the advantages of high power density and low pollutant emissions. However, PEMFC technology is still in the developing phase, and its large-scale industrial deployment requires increasing the life span of fuel cells and decreasing their exploitation costs. In this context, Prognostics and Health Management of fuel cells is an emerging field, which aims at identifying degradation at early stages and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. Indeed, due to prognostics capability, the accurate estimates of RUL enables safe operation of the equipment and timely decisions to prolong its life span. This paper contributes data-driven prognostics of PEMFC by an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of long-term prognostics. The SW-ELM is used for ensemble modeling due to its enhanced applicability for real applications as compared to conventional data-driven algorithms.

Studies aiming at modifying such biases with the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) have shown promise in changing maladaptive approach tendencies for addiction-related cues and reducing addictive behavior. However, training effects tend to be small and partly inconsistent. For this reason, we have already developed and evaluated a VR-AAT to improve efficacy of the training. Results showed that our new VR-AAT did not change approach biases, nor other cognitive biases, but it was superior in reducing daily smoking, and both groups improved in other smoking- and health-related variables across time.

The DS1 flight software will validate five autonomy technologies: 1) Planner/Scheduler, which receives ground or on-board requests for spacecraft activities and schedules them to resolve any resource conflicts or timing constraints; 2) Smart Executive, which expands planned activities into lower-level commands, deduces required hardware configurations or other actions, and provides detection and avoidance of constraint violations; 3) Mode Identification and Reconfiguration engine, which incorporates models of hardware and software behavior, detects discrepancies due to hardware or software failures, and requests recovery actions via the Smart Executive. 4) Autonomous Navigation, which determines the spacecraft trajectory from images of asteroids against the celestial sphere, and autonomously adjusts the trajectory to reach the target asteroid or comet. 5) Beacon Monitoring, which uses radio carrier modification and telemetry summarization to simplify ground monitoring of spacecraft health. Integration of these technologies into the spacecraft flight software architecture has presented a number of system engineering challenges, Some of these technologies were developed in a research-oriented, non-real-time, artificial intelligence organizational culture while spacecraft software is typically developed in a strong real-time, algorithmically-oriented culture. The Navigation technology has been developed in a ground-based environment. Integration of these different cultures and mutual education of the software team has been achieved.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in occupational safety in the construction industry. However, all the current methods using conventional machine learning with stationary cameras suffer from some severe limitations, perceptual aliasing (e.g., different places/objects can appear identical), occlusion (e.g., place/object appearance changes between visits), seasonal / illumination changes, significant viewpoint changes, etc. This paper proposes a perception module using end-to-end deep-learning and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for an effective and efficient object recognition and navigation using a differential-drive mobile robot. Various deep-learning frameworks and visual navigation strategies with evaluation metrics are implemented and validated for the selection of the best model. The deep-learning model's predictions are evaluated via the metrics (model speed, accuracy, complexity, precision, recall, P-R curve, F1 score). The YOLOv3 shows the best trade-off among all algorithms, 57.9% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 45 frames per second (FPS) on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a right candidate for deploying the neural network on a mobile robot. The evaluation metrics used for the comparison of laser SLAM are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The Google Cartographer SLAM shows the lowest RMSE and acceptable processing time. The experimental results demonstrate that the perception module can meet the requirements of head protection criteria in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for construction.

10.1109/SYSTOL.2010.5675940,Intelligent monitoring and fault tolerance in large-scale distributed systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only. Electronic devices are starting to become widely available for monitoring and controlling large-scale distributed systems. These devices may include sensing capabilities for online measurement, actuators for controlling certain variables, microprocessors for processing information and making realtime decisions based on designed algorithms, and telecommunication units for exchanging information with other electronic devices or possibly with human operators. A collection of such devices may be referred to as a networked intelligent agent system. Such systems have the capability to generate a huge volume of spatial-temporal data that can be used for monitoring and control applications of large-scale distributed systems. One of the most important research challenges in the years ahead is the development of information processing methodologies that can be used to extract meaning and knowledge out of the ever-increasing electronic information that will become available. Even more important is the capability to utilize the information that is being produced to design software and devices that operate seamlessly, autonomously and reliably in some intelligent manner. The ultimate objective is to design networked intelligent agent systems that can make appropriate real-time decisions in the management of large-scale distributed systems, while also providing useful high-level information to human operators. One of the most important classes of large-scale distributed systems deals with the reliable operation and intelligent management of critical infrastructures, such as electric power systems, telecommunication networks, water systems, and transportation systems. The design, control and fault monitoring of critical infrastructure systems is becoming increasingly more challenging as their size, complexity and interactions are steadily growing. Moreover, these critical infrastructures are susceptible to natural disasters, frequent failures, as well as malicious attacks. There is a need to develop a common system-theoretic fault diagnostic framework for critical infrastructure systems and to design architectures and algorithms for intelligent monitoring, control and security of such systems. The goal of this presentation is to motivate the need for health monitoring, fault diagnosis and security of critical infrastructure systems and to provide a fault diagnosis methodology for detecting, isolating and accommodating both abrupt and incipient faults in a class of complex nonlinear dynamic systems.

Harmful pesticides enter into the human body through fruits and vegetables, so an optimal solution is needed to recognize the disease and the pesticides in the fruits the common man is consuming. Hardware and a software design are done to obtain an accurate and a real time output. In this paper, a prototype of the system is developed with the use of four sensors, (temperature, gas, pH and moisture), Arduino microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module to get the information about the presence of pesticides. The maximum level of pesticides that is accepted legally to be consumed by animals and humans is given by MRL.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. MACHINE and AI justifiably attract the attention and interest not only of the wider scientific community and industry, but also society and policy makers. However, even the most powerful (in terms of accuracy) algorithms such as deep learning (DL) can give a wrong output, which may be fatal. Due to the opaque and cumbersome model structure used by DL, some authors started to talk about a dystopian &#x201C;black box&#x201D; society. Despite the success in this area, the way computers learn is still principally different from the way people acquire new knowledge, recognise objects and make decisions. People do not need a huge amount of annotated data. They learn by example, using similarities to previously acquired prototypes, not by using parametric analytical models. Current ML approaches are focused primarily on accuracy and overlook explainability, the semantic meaning of the internal model representation, reasoning and its link with the problem domain. They also overlook the efforts to collect and label training data and rely on assumptions about the data distribution that are often not satisfied. The ability to detect the unseen and unexpected and start learning this new class/es in real time with no or very little supervision is critically important and is something that no currently existing classifier can offer. The challenge is to fill this gap between high level of accuracy and the semantically meaningful solutions. The most efficient algorithms that have fuelled interest towards ML and AI recently are also computationally very hungry - they require specific hardware accelerators such as GPU, huge amounts of labeled data and time. They produce parametrised models with hundreds of millions of coefficients, which are also impossible to interpret or be manipulated by a human. Once trained, such models are inflexible to new knowledge. They cannot dynamically evolve their internal structure to start recognising new classes. They are good only for what they were originally trained for. They also lack robustness, formal guarantees about their behaviour and explanatory and normative transparency. This makes problematic use of such algorithms in high stake complex problems such as aviation, health, bailing from jail, etc. where the clear rationale for a particular decision is very important and the errors are very costly. All these challenges and identified gaps require a dramatic paradigm shift and a radical new approach. In this talk the speaker will present such a new approach towards the next generation of computationally lean ML and AI algorithms that can learn in real-time using normal CPUs on computers, laptops, smartphones or even be implemented on chip that will change dramatically the way these new technologies are being applied. It is explainable-by-design. It focuses on addressing the open research challenge of developing highly efficient, accurate ML algorithms and AI models that are transparent, interpretable, explainable and fair by design. Such systems are able to self-learn lifelong, and continuously improve without the need for complete retraining, can start learning from few training data samples, explore the data space, detect and learn from unseen data patterns, collaborate with humans or other such algorithms seamlessly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9431114/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops and other Affiliated Events (PerCom Workshops),22-26 March 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Moreover, health monitoring has emphasized the need for edge computing to process real-time data without the bandwidth costs. However, the reconstructed analysis (RA) and the compressed learning (CL) frameworks have extremely high memory and computational overhead, cost-prohibitive for online usage at resource-constrained edge device. In this paper, to efficiently analyze the received CS measurements with different levels of compression, we propose a low-complexity framework of Compressive Analysis in Sub-Eigenspace (CA-SE) based on subspace-based representation. The dictionary is used for sifting the sub-eigen information from the CS measurements online, and it is built by eigenspace learning offline. The framework can reduce the memory overhead with a single light-weight machine learning model and multiple small filter matrices, and the computational complexity with sifting by matrix-vector product rather than sparse coding. CA-SE is implemented in ECG-based atrial fibrillation detection. The memory overhead of CA-SE is 13 and 39 times fewer compared with RA and CL, respectively, and the computational complexity of CA-SE is 42 and 10 times fewer compared with RA and CL, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682766/,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",12-17 May 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Even though there are several technological advancements made in this area, solutions like smartwatches are costly to afford and the solutions that rely on sensors and cameras suffer from privacy concerns. While wireless channel state information-based approaches can address some of these limitations, these approaches either require special hardware to be deployed or modifications at the WiFi access point. In this paper, we propose to detect human activities in a device-agnostic manner by leveraging passively captured passively captured WiFi MAC-layer traffic with the help of a sniffer. In that way, elderly people and those who suffer from chronic health conditions do not need to put any sensors on their body. This approach is not only cost-effective, but it is also easy to deploy without requiring any changes at the WiFi access point or installing special sensors in the environment. We train and test six off-the-shelf machine learning models on 15+ hours worth of WiFi MAC-layer traffic collected in a home environment.

Ideally, it is desirable to make all the features of the collected data private but due to resource limitations, it is not always possible as it may cause overutilization of resources, which in turn affects the performance of the whole system. In this work, we use the generalization techniques for data anonymization and provide customized injective privacy encoder functions to make data features private. Regardless of the resource availability, some data features must be essentially private. All other data features that may pose low privacy threat are termed as nonessential features. We propose Dynamic Iterative Greedy Search (DIGS), a novel approach with corresponding algorithms to select the set of optimal data features to be private for machine learning applications provided device resource constraints. DIGS selects the necessary and the most private version of data for the application, where all essential and a subset of nonessential features are made private on the edge device without resource overutilization. We have implemented DIGS in Python and evaluated it on Raspberry Pi model A (an edge device with limited resources) for an SVM-based classification on real-life health care data. Our evaluation results show that, while providing the required level of privacy, DIGS allows to achieve up to 26.21% memory, 16.67% CPU instructions, and 30.5% of network bandwidth savings as compared to making all the data private.

Embedded networks with near real-time constraints are subject to denial-of-service attacks which can easily affect the applications availability by injecting malicious packets into the network.

Furthermore, congestion contributes enormously to damaging the environment and people's health. In an attempt to combat the damage congestion is causing, new technologies are being developed, such as intelligent infrastructures and smart vehicles. The aim of this study is to develop a fuzzy system that can classify congestion using a real-world dataset referred to as Manchester Urban Congestion Dataset, which contains data similar to that collected by connected and autonomous vehicles. A set of fuzzy membership functions and rules were developed using a road congestion ontology and in conjunction with domain experts. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the fuzzy system in terms of its precision and recall in classifying congestion. Comparisons are made in terms of performance with traditional classification algorithms decision trees and Naïve Bayes using the Red, Amber, and Green classification methods currently implemented by Transport for Greater Manchester to label the dataset.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organization (WHO) director-general on March 11th declared the COVID-19 pandemic. The cumulative cases of infected individuals and deaths due to COVID-19 develop a graph that could be interpreted by an exponential function. Mathematical models are therefore fundamental to understanding the evolution of the pandemic. Applying machine learning prediction methods in conjunction with cloud computing to such models will be beneficial in designing effective control strategies for the current or future spread of infectious diseases. Initially, we compare the trendlines of the following three models: linear, exponential and polynomial using R-squared, to determine which model best interprets the prevailing data sets of cumulative infectious cases and cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 disease.

One aspect of player immersion is the level of challenge the game presents to the player. To avoid a mismatch between a player's skill and the challenge of a game, which can result from traditional manual difficulty selection mechanisms (e.g. easy, medium, hard), Dynamic Dif­ficulty Adjustment (DDA) has previously been proposed as a means of automatically detecting a player's skill and adjusting the level of challenge the game presents accordingly. This work contributes to the field of DDA by proposing a novel approach to artificially intelligent agents for opponent control. Specifically, we propose four new DDA Artificially Intelligent (AI) agents: Reactive Outcome Sensitive Action Selection (Reactive OSAS), Proactive OSAS, and their ""True"" variants. These agents provide the player with an level of difficulty tailored to their skill in real-time by altering the action selection policy and the heuristic playout evaluation of Monte Carlo Tree Search. The DDA AI agents are tested within the FightingICE engine, which has been used in the past as an environment for AI agent competitions. The results of the experiments against other AI agents and human players show that these novel DDA AI agents can adjust the level of difficulty in real-time, by targeting a zero health difference as the outcome of the fighting game. This work also demonstrates the trade-off existing between targeting the outcome exactly (Reactive OSAS) and introducing proactive behaviour (i.e., the DDA AI agent fights even if the health difference is zero) to increase the agents believability (Proactive OSAS).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8080415/,2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG),22-25 Aug. 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To diagnose diseases, clinical researchers use a machine-learning algorithm to do multi-label clinical text classification. However, conventional machine learning methods can neither capture deep semantic information nor the context of words strictly. Diagnostic information from the EHRs (Electronic Health Records) is mainly constructed by unstructured clinical free text which is an obstacle for clinical feature extraction. Moreover, feature engineering is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the rapid development of deep learning, we apply neural network models to resolve this problem mentioned above. To favor multi-label classification on EHRs, we propose FAMLC-BERT (Feature-level Attention for Multi-label classification on BERT) to capture semantic features from different layers.

The COVID-19 is virulent and spreads widely. An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal InformatioN fusion COVID-19 Epidemic forecasting model (MINE).

Passive sensing based continuous behavior tracking can prevent the escalation of such episodes. But, predicting such behavior from sensor streams, especially in real-world residential settings, is still an active area of research. Major challenges include the sparsity, unpredictability, and variations in such behavior, as well as the ""weak"" annotations from real-world participants. This paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these issues in predicting agitation episodes from the PWD's wrist motion data. In a transdisciplinary study on dementia dyads residing in their homes, the PWD motion is continuously sensed from their smart watch inertial sensors, while agitation episodes are actively marked by the caregivers. The data from 10 residential deployments, each with 30 days duration, are analyzed in this paper, and multiple-instance learning (MIL) based models are implemented to learn from such sparse and weakly annotated data.

10.1109/QRS51102.2020.00018,PHM Technology for Memory Anomalies in Cloud Computing for IaaS,IEEE,Conferences,"The IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) is one of the most popular services from todays cloud service providers, where the virtual machines (VM) are rented by users who can deploy any program they want in the VMs to make their own websites or use as their remote desktops. However, this poses a major challenge for cloud IaaS providers who cannot control the software programs that users develop, install or download on their rented VMs. Those programs may not be well developed with various bugs or even downloaded/installed together with virus, which often make damages to the VMs or infect the cloud platform. To keep the health of a cloud IaaS platform, it is very important to implement the PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technology for detecting those software problems and self-healing them in an intelligent and timely way. This paper realized a novel PHM technology inspired by biological autonomic nervous system to deal with the memory anomalies of those programs running on the cloud IaaS platform. We first present an innovative autonomic computing technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS) to endow the cloud system with distinctive capabilities of perception, detection, reflection, and learning. Then, we propose a BANS-based Prognostics and Health Management (BPHM) technology to enable the cloud system self-dealing with various memory anomalies. AI-based failure prognostics, immediate self-healing, self-learning ability and self-improvement functions are implemented. Experimental results illustrate that the designed BPHM can automatically and intelligently deal with complex memory anomalies in a real cloud system for IaaS, to keep the system much more reliable and healthier.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9282796/,"2020 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)",11-14 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICPHM.2019.8819386,Part Name Normalization,IEEE,Conferences,"Parts information plays a key role in prognostics and health management. However, expressions of parts often have a wide range of variations, spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. Normalization of such terms is crucial for many applications. Part names post a major challenge also because they tend to be in the form of multi-word terms. In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method UNAMER (Unification and Normalization Analysis, Misspelling Evaluation and Recognition). It is a general method for identifying term variants, including multi-word term variants, and normalizing them under a canonical name. UNAMER does not rely on a predefined set of canonical terms, which is often hard to obtain. Given a term, UNAMER first identifies candidate variants by exploiting contextual information. It then uses a supervised machine learning model, trained using easy-to-generate examples, that leverages both contextual and lexical features to predict actual variants from the candidates. UNAMER further extends its capability to normalize multi-word parts, such as part names like `lt pnl', `letf pnl' and `lft panal' for `left panel' using a specialized linguistically motivated term alignment approach. UNAMER has been deployed in practical applications to normalize part names in the aerospace domain. We will use examples from these real-life applications to demonstrate and illustrate results from UNAMER.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8819386/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM),17-20 June 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This change of demographic landscape has caused a severe manpower shortage. It reduces the pool of people in their productive years. Several countries have conducted plans to extend the retirement age to keep elderly workers in the labor market longer. However, maintaining health and physical ability among elderly workers is a primary issue. To address the problem, regular physical exercise is crucial. In this paper, we propose an innovative software system that support the elderly to participate in walking exercise regularly.

10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902,Personalized wearable systems for real-time ECG classification and healthcare interoperability: Real-time ECG classification and FHIR interoperability,IEEE,Conferences,"Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

The Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) property of DWT is used for the extraction of the detailed components form the inverter line-to-line voltage and subsequently, these are used for the computation of energy at each level. Additionally, various voltage ratios from the line-to-line voltage are computed. In fact, line-to-line voltage is independent of the nature of load and hence, it is considered as the analysing signal. The voltage ratios together with the calculated energies are considered as the important features for the ANN training for short-switch faults. The whole scheme is implemented by simulation in Matlab/ Simulink. The simulation results show that the scheme successfully identifies the short switch fault for any switch health conditions. Moreover, the scheme is simple and does not involve too many computations. This ensures the real time applicability of the proposed algorithm in any fast acting digital signal processor.

In recent years, researchers have used deep recurrent neural networks to predict patients' next-period prescriptions. The main challenges of predicting next-period prescriptions are as follows: i) The latent interdependence information which can be utilized to enhance the representation of the data between heterogeneous features is dynamic. However, most existing approaches do not consider capturing and utilizing this information. ii) Conventional recurrent neural networks cannot store historical interdependent information between heterogeneous features and take advantage of it. To address these challenges, We propose a novel attention mechanism named Cross Attention (CA) that can capture the interdependence between two sequences.

This work reports about application of some machine learning methods (linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, support-vector machine) for monitoring energy expenditures in athletes. The classification problem was to predict the known level of the in-exercise loads (in three categories by calories) by the heart rate activity features measured during the short period of time (1 minute only) after training, i.e by features of the post-exercise load. The results obtained shown that the post-exercise heart activity features preserve the information of the in-exercise training loads and allow us to predict their actual in-exercise levels. The best performance can be obtained by the random forest classifier with all 8 heart rate features (micro-averaged area under curve value AUCmicro = 0.87 and macro-averaged one AUCmacro = 0.88) and the k-nearest neighbors classifier with 4 most important heart rate features (AUCmicro =0.91 and AUCmacro =0.89).

Therefore, a lightweight and ready-to-go approach that is able to detect anomalies in real-time is highly sought-after. Such an approach could be easily and immediately applied to perform time series anomaly detection on any commodity machine. The approach could provide timely anomaly alerts and by that enable appropriate countermeasures to be undertaken as early as possible. With these goals in mind, this paper introduces ReRe, which is a Real-time Ready-to-go proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for streaming time series. ReRe employs two lightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict and jointly determine whether or not an upcoming data point is anomalous based on short-term historical data points and two long-term self-adaptive thresholds.

Driven by market pressure to reduce cost and maintain quality of services, they are looking for technologies that will allow rapid progress towards attainment of truly automated service delivery. Software monitoring systems are designed to actively collect and signal event occurrences and, when necessary, automatically generate incident tickets. Repeating events generate similar tickets, which in turn have a vast number of repeated problem resolutions likely to be found in earlier tickets. In our work, we develop techniques to recommend an appropriate resolution for incoming events by making use of similarities between the events and historical resolutions of similar events. The traditional KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) algorithm has been first applied to recommend resolutions for incoming tickets. Massive heterogeneous applications as well as various monitoring software are running on clients' servers to accomplish required tasks and to monitor system health via different metrics. It leads to generation of correlated tickets that have different symptom descriptions but similar resolutions. Furthermore, change of servers' environments can also induce similar situations in which ticket descriptions differ before and after change but could have similar resolutions. These correlated tickets cause performance degradation in ticket resolution recommendation. Therefore, we propose using SCL (structural corresponding learning) based feature adaptation to uncover feature mapping in different time intervals. Moreover, to put more insights into the periodic regularities existing in our ticket datasets, we apply our algorithm on tickets grouped by different time interval granularities.

Wearable devices such as bracelets and watches have also developed rapidly in recent years. However, wearable devices cannot perform complex calculations or transmit large amounts of data on a chip because of limited computing power and strict power control. Therefore, it is necessary to extract the most effective features with the least amount of computation. In this paper, physical activity data is obtained by attaching sensor nodes to multiple parts of the human body, then time-domain features and frequency-domain features are extracted from sliding windows of different lengths to study the implementation scheme of efficient recognition of human activity. It is found that the recognition effect is better when two sensor nodes are tied to trunk and left leg respectively and 250 sampling points are selected as the sliding window length. Experimental results show that compared with using all features directly, the time-domain feature selected by Genetic Algorithm is the most effective feature.

In their homes, robotic agents shall enable people to stay independent, even if they have disabilities that require physical help in their daily life - a pressing need for our aging societies. A key requirement for such robotic agents is that they are safety-aware, that is, that they know when actions may hurt or threaten humans and actively refrain from performing them. Safe robot control systems are a current research focus in control theory. The control system designs, however, are a bit paranoid: programmers build “software fences” around people, effectively preventing physical interactions. To physically interact in a competent manner robotic agents have to reason about the task context, the human, and her intentions.

The low accuracy of such sensors also motivates the need for data-driven calibration models that can accurately predict the science variables from the raw sensor signals. Here, we offer our experiences with designing and deploying such an IoT software platform and calibration models, and validate it through a pilot field deployment at two mega-cities, Delhi and Mumbai. Our edge data service is able to even-out the differential bandwidths from the sensing devices and to the Cloud repository, and recover from transient failures. Our analytical models reduce the errors of the sensors from a best-case of 63% using the factory baseline to as low as 21%, and substantially advances the state-of-the-art in this domain.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9041703/,2019 15th International Conference on eScience (eScience),24-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/PCI.2009.40,SEMPATH: Adapting Clinical Pathways by Utilizing Semantic Technologies,IEEE,Conferences,"The increase of treatment quality offered by the healthcare organizations is one of the main challenges of the modern health informatics. The personalization of treatment presupposes the real-time adaptation of treatment schemes since the clinical status of the patient and circumstances inside a healthcare organization constantly change. In this paper we present SEMPATH prototype which aims at providing a solution concerning the real-time adaptation of healthcare business processes. The prototype consists of a healthcare process execution engine assisted by a semantic framework for the adaptation. The semantic framework consists of an ontology enclosing the required knowledge based on which a semantic rule set was created. During the execution time of the clinical pathways, the system reasons over the rules, the knowledge and information collected, and provides decisions and recommendations for the next steps of the treatment. Moreover, the results of the rule-set execution may produce new knowledge objects which are inserted in the ontology.

If we refer to etymology, ""metrology"" means ""science of measurement"". The business measurement approach should therefore fall within the realm of rigor and rationality by performing periodic calibration. By using new technologies (IT, Machine learning, etc.), work methods can be innovated by modernizing measurement techniques and by introducing the notion of intelligence. ""SMART Metrology"" or ""intelligent metrology"" is therefore required to take care of the automatic calibration and monitoring of equipment and will provide reliable and repeatable measurements, which will be verified by legal metrology. It is therefore used to create SMART measuring instruments that transform measurement results into controlled information. More and more companies are opting for Smart metrology for the simple reason that it modernizes the techniques of taking measurements introducing new concepts, in particular Big Data. This technology offers metrologists the opportunity to develop their profession, allowing them to actively participate in the compliance of measuring instruments and the reliability of measurements in the company. This paper presents a SMART platform for calibrating spectrum analyzers available in a metrology laboratory using Python programming software.

'Waste contamination' is a critical issue that affects waste management, and it should be addressed during the garbage collection process. This has led to environmental hazards resulting in health and other social issues. Hence, it is a responsibility of an organization to separate the garbage during the collection process using a suitable technique. In this paper, we are proposing a smart garbage bin kit that automates the separation of garbage collection, which minimizes human error using AI-based technologies. IoT-based devices connected to a smart garbage bin kit guide the user to the correct bin. At the same time, our proposed system can be easily expanded for new special waste categories as well. The other important issue of the current garbage management is improper time management of the garbage removal process in organizations. This happens due to the lack of real-time data on waste bins, and collection is based on the fixed time interval irrespective of the status and location of garbage bins. In the proposed system of SMART Garbage Bin Kit, the group of all interconnected garbage bins is monitored in real-time to identify the optimum collection path considering the location and the status of garbage bins using an optimized algorithm. Hence, the study presented in this paper integrates several intelligent approaches together with IoT based network to build a cutting-edge device, declared as SMART Garbage Bin kit.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities.

10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00037,STAR: A Scalable Self-taught Learning Framework for Older Adults’ Activity Recognition,IEEE,Conferences,"Activity Recognition (AR) in older adults living with Neurocognitive disorders caused by diseases such as Alzheimer’s is still a challenging research problem. The inherent natural variation in performing an activity increases while repeating the same activity for an older adult, let alone the variation introduced when another older adult performs the same activity. Moreover, the challenges in acquiring the labeled data while preserving the privacy, availability of annotators with domain knowledge, aversion towards cameras even for a minimal amount of time for ground truth data collection, and psychological and mental health status make AR for older adults challenging. In this paper, we postulate a self-taught learning-based approach that helps recognize activities with variations that are not being directly seen during the training phase. We hypothesize that the features extracted using deep architectures from unlabeled data instances can learn general underlying representations of activities efficiently and help improve activity classification in a supervised setting, although the data instances in labeled data do not follow the generative distribution of that of unlabeled data. We posit real data from a retirement community center using our in-house SenseBox infrastructure and survey-based assessments concurrently done by a clinical evaluator to study the relationship between activities and functional/behavioral health of older adults. We evaluate our proposed self-taught learning-based approach, STAR, using the presented in-house Alzheimer’s Activity Recognition (AAR) dataset acquired in a real-world deployment in 25 homes which outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by about 20%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556229/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP),23-27 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the increased security incidents and leakage of patient data raise the concerns to address security risks and privacy issues of mhealth applications urgently. While recent mobile health applications that rely on password-based authentication cannot withstand password guessing and cracking attacks, several countermeasures such as One-Time Password (OTP), grid-based password, and biometric authentication have recently been implemented to protect mobile health applications. These countermeasures, however, can be thwarted by brute force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and persistent malware attacks. This paper proposed grid-based honey encryption by hybridising honey encryption with grid-based authentication. Compared to recent honey encryption limited in the hardening password attacks process, the proposed grid-based honey encryption can be further employed against shoulder surfing, smudge and replay attacks.

Nowadays IoT is being used in many fields of Information Technology and general life like in the fields of health, agriculture, weather etc. Due to its advantages it is getting popularity and hence attracting the hackers and attackers for novel attacks. To run the IoT related services interruption free and to save the private data of the network users, the installation of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential step. The efficiency of an IDS depends upon the efficiency of classifier being used inside the IDS for detecting the attacks or intrusion. To become an IDS an efficient IDS, it should not only be efficient in major performance measuring parameters but also it should be as quick as possible to detect the intrusion in the network so that it can detect the attack in real time. To achieve this objective many classifiers have been used for the implementation of IDS. In this work, tree-based ensemble methods are used for checking their performance to identify network attacks in IoT architecture. For this purpose, BoT-IoT dataset, a well-known and publicly available dataset is used for the said purpose. The tree-based ensemble methods used in this work for identifying the attacks in the IoT network are Random Forest, LGBM, Extra Tree, Gradient Boost, XGBoost.

Unlike traditional Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), self-aware SoCs must deploy an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing infrastructure that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the systems behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). Self-aware SoCs require a combination of ubiquitous sensing and actuation, health-monitoring, and self-learning to enable the SoCs adaptation over time and space.

The essential part of this method is based on an adaptive network architecture which utilizes both fuzzy model (FIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) into the framework of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). While battery aging proceeds, the system is capable of delivering accurate power prediction for the typical temperature range. Due to design property of ANN, the network parameters are adapted on-line to the current states (state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature). SoC is required as an input parameter to SoAP module and high accuracy is crucial for a reliable self-learning capability. Therefore, a reasonable way to determine the battery state variables is proposed applying a combination of several partly different algorithms. Among others SoC boundary estimation methods, robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) for recalibration of amp hour counters was implemented. ANFIS then achieves the SoAP estimation by means of time forward voltage prognosis (TFVP) before a power pulse. The tradeoff between computational cost of batch-learning and accuracy during on-line adaptation was optimized resulting in a real-time system.

In contrast, options for re-using existing models seem more limited. Re-use of simulation component models by collaborating organizations is restricted by the same semantic issues however that restrict the inter-organization use of web services. The current representations of web components are predominantly syntactic in nature lacking the fundamental semantic underpinning required to support discovery on the emerging semantic web. Semantic models, in the form of ontology, utilized by web service discovery and deployment architecture provide one approach to support simulation model reuse. Semantic interoperation is achieved through the use of simulation component ontology to identify required components at varying levels of granularity (including both abstract and specialized components). Selected simulation components are loaded into a CSP, modified according to the requirements of the new model and executed. The paper presents the development of ontology, connector software and web service discovery architecture in order to understand how such ontology are created, maintained and subsequently used for simulation model reuse. The ontology is extracted from health service simulation - comprising hospitals and the National Blood Service. The ontology engineering framework and discovery architecture provide a novel approach to inter- organization simulation, uncovering domain semantics and adopting a less intrusive interface between participants.

Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults. We include an analysis and discussion of ADTM's performance on several of these fault cases. We conclude with a brief discussion of future work, which contains investigation of a hierarchical SOM-architecture as well as a Case-Based Reasoning module for further assisting astronauts in diagnosis and remediation activities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172454/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models.

Here, we introduce an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable bioelectronics platform for portable, real-time physiological monitoring and accurate classification biopotentials, including electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and electromyograms (EMG). The nanomembrane sensor and multi-layered electronic system is manufactured by integration of microfabrication techniques, aerosol jet printing of nanoparticles, photonic sintering, and hard-soft materials assembly. Strategic integration with hyperelastic elastomers allows the device to adhere and deform naturally with human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. Stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact acquire high-quality biopotentials. Comparison of those signals with commercial systems captures the improved performance and significant noise reduction of the stretchable bioelectronics.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0250,Smart autonomous wireless acoustic sensors for aeronautical SHM applications,IEEE,Conferences,"Ultrasound technologies are of great interest for aeronautical structure inspection. Mainly deployed through Phased Array (PA) ultrasonic transducer, ultrasound inspection is currently used as a complementary tool for the local examination of the structure to determine geometry, damage or composition of invisible flaws like cracks, delamination and corrosion. This approach cannot be easily automated since the access to the area of interest often requires to pass through the complex aeronautical structure. Moreover this approach relies on a high degree of human interaction, as the user often decides the spatial inspection sampling according to his intuition and experience of the structure composition and vulnerability. Structure Health Monitoring, namely SHM, overcomes these limitations by enabling rapid, automated, remote, and real-time monitoring of the structure to reduce operational costs and increase lifetime of structures. This inspection strategy gains its strength from the use of a large amount of individual embedded sensors with embedded intelligence (sensing, signal processing, communicating and storing relevant data in non-volatile memories) organized in dense network, a Neural Network. We present in this paper the developments of a novel autonomous wireless acoustic sensor node, including: a flat flexural acoustic sensor capable of working in transmit and receive, a custom vibrational piezoelectric energy harvesting device (PEH) charging a 0.5 Farad buffer supercapacitance through a commercial rectifying IC, an ARM based cortex M3 microprocessor driving digitization, signal processing, data storage and two ways RF communication.

Therefore, the goal of health systems is to ensure 100% coverage in the implementation of screening. Unfortunately, the real coverage is far smaller and often below 50%, hence the issue of efficient screening is very important. This paper presents software support that is implemented in three ways and aims at more efficient implementation of screening programs. The production of a software module for the registration of patients for screening programs, significantly facilitates the traditional access to this data and enables the higher coverage of the target population.

This paper presents a novel implementation of three tools which can be used together to make the analysis and handling of this data easier. The first of these tools is a statistical classifier which automatically assigns labels to the process data. The classifier is trained using historical data containing examples of events of interest, such as recordings taken when maintenance activity or failures have developed. In practice, the labels are used to pre-filter the data, to bring swift attention to events of interest, and to automatically create categorised datasets which can be used to analyse historical performance. Two different types of classifier are presented: a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier and a neural network classifier. The second tool is a simple pattern recognition algorithm which can determine when the different phases of mechanical operation in a single track switch movement occur, for example locking, unlocking, and moving.

In addition to the environmental advantages, cycling aids in improving public health, increasing cycling population and contributing to transit use. With the increasing number of bike-sharing service providers around the world, a real-time demand-supply tracking system which brings together the service providers and bike enthusiasts is implemented. Though there are several bike-sharing applications readily available for the users, currently there are no apps for the bike-sharing owners to track the demand-supply for bikes in real-time for any given station. We implemented a real-time demand-supply system that provides to the bike owner information regarding the demand-supply for bikes in any particular station at any particular time through a dashboard and also does forecasting of the bike demand. The Bike Demand forecasting uses the following classifiers: random forest, gradient boosting and linear regression, to predict the number of bikes in demand at a particular station in real-time. Results from the above-mentioned methods are compared and the method with the best results is chosen to supplement information provided by the dashboard to show the demand. For all three of our datasets, XGBoost on the dataset with all stations outperformed all the other models and hence XGBoost on trips data was chosen for the web application.

In this study, a supervised machine learning-based fall detection was developed using a wearable accelerometer device fitted to the subject's waist. Fifteen volunteers performed a standardized set of movements which were developed by mimicking the scenarios in the FARSEEING Fall Repository, including 10 falling activities and 10 non-falling activities, resulting in a dataset with 900 samples. Supervised Learning is implemented by using two training sets: (1) 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities and (2) 10 real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository added to the 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities. Testing is done by using the remaining 20% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities, remaining five real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository, and actual testing in a simulated environment. Results show that the model with the training data using simulated falls only (Model 1) detected a 10% TPR while the model with real-world fall added (Model 2) detected a 100% TPR when tested using unseen data. Validating using the actual simulated fall and non-falls, Model l resulted in a 93.33% TPR and Model 2 at 96.67%.

Condition indicators are the basic components of diagnosis. It is important to select feature vectors that meet the criteria in order to provide true accuracy and powerful diagnostic routines. Our goal is to indicate the actual system status according to the workload, and use clustering techniques to analyze the workload distribution density to build diagnostic templates. Such templates can be used for system failure forewarning. In the proposed system, we present an approach, based on workload density cluster analysis to automatically monitor the health of software systems and system failure forewarning. Our approach consists of tracking the workload density of metric clusters. We employ the statistical template model to automatically identify significant changes in cluster moving, therefore enabling robust fault detection. We observed two circumstances from the experiment results. First, under most normal status, the lowest accuracy value is approximate our theoretical minimum threshold of 84%. Such result implies a close correlation between our measured and real system status. Second, the command data used by the system could predict 90% of events announced, which reveals the prediction effectiveness of this proposed system.

The side-effect is that the anonymization may lead to useless data to train and test the AI because it is highly dependent on the quality of the data. To overcome this problem, we propose a test-driven anonymization approach for artificial intelligence tools. The approach tests different anonymization efforts to achieve a trade-off in terms of privacy (non-functional quality) and functional suitability of the artificial intelligence technique (functional quality). The approach has been validated by means of two real-life datasets in the domains of healthcare and health insurance.

From the interview with health workers in the field, we realized ML model should be continuously improved to provide higher accuracy and/or more capability to cover practical issues found in a real setting such as malaria mosquitoes with drug resistance. In this paper, we propose the mobile application for malaria detection which upgrades ML model on its own without depending on internet connection. Unavailability of internet connection is commonly observed in malaria epidemic countries. We also learned that ML model should be not only accurate but also resource-efficient. This motivated us to set up performance metrics for ML model. Based on the metrics, we chose the optimal ML model of Resnet-50. While most of the prior art ML models were optimized in terms of accuracy only, the optimal model of our choice satisfies both accuracy and resource efficiency. With adopting the model, we architect self-upgrading malaria-detection application and it is validated using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) to ensure the application works in the resource-constrained setting as desired. Lastly, we develop the prototype application and show it diagnoses malaria parasites as expected. To collect more blood samples and feedback from prospect users, we plan to do testing at local clinics in India and Myanmar.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031201/,2020 10th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),6-8 Jan. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, “real-time” ADL recognition is essential to realize such a service that the system needs to know the user's current activity. There are many studies on ADL recognition. However, none of these studies address all of the following problems: (1) privacy intrusion due to the utilization of high privacy-invasive devices such as cameras and microphones; (2) limited number of recognizable activities; (3) low recognition accuracy; (4) high deployment and maintenance costs due to many sensors used; and (5) long recognition time. In our prior work, we proposed a system which solves the problems (1)- (4) to some extent by using user's position data and power consumption data of home electric appliances. In this paper, aiming to solve all the above problems including (5), we propose a new system by extending our prior work. To realize “real-time” ADL recognition while keeping good recognition accuracy, we developed new power meters with higher sensing frequency and introduced new techniques such as adding new features, selecting the best subset of the features, and selecting the best training dataset used for machine learning.

Although normal operation of battery packs can be simulated in the lab to generate aging data, a variety of other non-operational profiles are typically needed, requiring many hours of testing, often at conditions different than normal operational conditions observed when the battery pack is deployed in its intended application. Moreover, application of prolonged and multiple capacity tests can be detrimental to the health of the battery. In view of these concerns, this article continues a line of research into capacity fade estimation approaches that require less data and time for the data generation process; in particular, an approach using rule based machine learning for Li-ion battery packs is proposed. Using data generated in the laboratory, aging behavior is characterized by measurable features and a supervised learning approach in order to estimate capacity fade using real-time operational data toward the goal of eliminating the need for specific capacity tests.

For Human Activity Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have shown their capability to provide better performance compared to other machine learning methods. However, ANNs suffer from two major limitations. First, ANNs are often trained using supervised learning requiring labelled databases, which are often difficult to build in real applications. Then, those algorithms are usually very expensive in terms of computing power. For that reason, their integration into low-power microcontrollers has been so far only evaluated to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the embedded implementation of different neural networks for human activity recognition. First, supervised learning approaches are presented, followed by an exploratory study of unsupervised learning approaches using Self-Organizing Maps. Finally, some aspects of embedded unsupervised online learning are investigated to improve classification results using subject-specific data over a more general training.

In addition to being able to reflect the body displacement along with the ventricle contraction, the BCG signals also contain multiple sources of interferences, and thus can be used to detect the modes of the body motions. An ensemble machine learning scheme is developed to classify the BCG waveform into several categories, including off-seat, sedate, working and in motion. When an employee is in a sedate position, the BCG samples can be further processed to observe the cardiovascular activities.

Reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is a promising approach to design better control policies and has attracted considerable research interest in recent years.

An application that lacks a strong implementation for anomaly detection is user trait modeling. User trait models expose up-to-date representation of the user so that changes in their interests, their learning progress or interactions with the system are noticed and interpreted. The reason behind the lack of adoption in user trait modeling arises from the need for a continuous flow of high-volume data, that is not available in most cases, to achieve high-accuracy detection. This paper provides new insight into the anomaly detection techniques through Big Data utilization. With Big Data characteristics, i.e., volume, variety and velocity, anomaly detection techniques have become more suitable tools for user trait modeling. User traits will be modeled by creating a security user profile for each user. This profile is structured and developed to be a source for a strong real-time user authentication method.

Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used. The output of the LSTM network is deciding the current life condition of components and offering the alerts for components before the end of their life. The proposed model also trained and tested on an open source data that is about an engine degradation simulation provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7935834/,2017 4th International Conference on Electrical and Electronic Engineering (ICEEE),8-10 April 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICEPDS.2018.8571820,Using Robot and Electric Drive in Fall Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"The global aging phenomenon has motivated active research in human fall injuries. The fall prevention has hence become a popular topic in health informatics. An effective fall prevention paradigm could save millions of people from injury and avoid considerable casualties. Through comparison studies, detail-oriented simulations, and pragmatic field tests, an effective fall prediction method has been developed by authors. The finding is presented in this paper. Three techniques for fall prediction are discussed in this paper. A comparison technique to mimic the traditional stateless fall prediction techniques, along with an algorithm using artificial neural network, was first implemented in authors' previous paper. Then a robotic scheme was developed to simulate human fall by transplanting a proven fall prediction paradigm for humanoid robots with controlled electric drive systems to human subjects. Due to its simulation nature far from the human fall scenarios in reality, the robotic paradigm has obvious limits in real world applications. It was also used more like a reference framework for our last scheme. Eventually we built the third approach that eliminated the above limitation. The third approach is elaborated in this paper. Our test and simulation have proved its pragmatic superiority over other two approaches, along with vast majority of traditional paradigms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8571820/,2018 X International Conference on Electrical Power Drive Systems (ICEPDS),3-6 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/AERO.2015.7119180,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to achieve a robust architecture for future robotic spacecraft,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator. The avionics and robot control were integrated on an embedded, space-qualified Airbus e.Cube on-board computer. The experiments showed that the integration of SOM for robot failure detection positively complemented the capabilities of traditional FDIR methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7119180/,2015 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ISMAR.2019.00-22,VR Props: An End-to-End Pipeline for Transporting Real Objects Into Virtual and Augmented Environments,IEEE,Conferences,"Improvements in both software and hardware, as well as an increase in consumer suitable equipment, have resulted in great advances in the fields of virtual and augmented reality. Typically, systems use controllers or hand gestures to interact with virtual objects. However, these motions are often unnatural and diminish the immersion of the experience. Moreover, these approaches offer limited tactile feedback. There does not currently exist a platform to bring an arbitrary physical object into the virtual world without additional peripherals or the use of expensive motion capture systems. Such a system could be used for immersive experiences within the entertainment industry as well as being applied to VR or AR training experiences, in the fields of health and engineering. We propose an end-to-end pipeline for creating an interactive virtual prop from rigid and non-rigid physical objects. This includes a novel method for tracking the deformations of rigid and non-rigid objects at interactive rates using a single RGBD camera. We scan our physical object and process the point cloud to produce a triangular mesh. A range of possible deformations can be obtained by using a finite element method simulation and these are reduced to a low dimensional basis using principal component analysis. Machine learning approaches, in particular neural networks, have become key tools in computer vision and have been used on a range of tasks. Moreover, there has been an increased trend in training networks on synthetic data. To this end, we use a convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data, to track the movement and potential deformations of an object in unlabelled RGB images from a single RGBD camera. We demonstrate our results for several objects with different sizes and appearances.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943647/,2019 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR),14-18 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/CogMI52975.2021.00021,Valence/Arousal Estimation of Occluded Faces from VR Headsets,IEEE,Conferences,"Emotion recognition from facial visual signals is a challenge which has attracted enormous interest over the past two decades. Researchers are attempting to teach computers to better understand a person&#x0027;s emotional state. Providing emotion recognition can massively enrich experiences. The benefits of this research for human-computer interactions are limitless. Emotions are intricate, and so we need a representative model of the full spectrum displayed by humans. A multi-dimensional emotion representation, which includes valence (how positive an emotion) and arousal (how calming or exciting an emotion), is a good fit. Virtual Reality (VR), a fully immersive computer-generated world, has witnessed significant growth over the past years. It has a wide range of applications including in mental health, such as exposure therapy and the self-attachment technique. In this paper, we address the problem of emotion recognition when the user is immersed in VR. Understanding emotions from facial cues is in itself a demanding task. It is made even harder when a head-mounted VR headset is worn, as now an occlusion blocks the upper half of the face. We attempt to overcome this issue by introducing EmoFAN-Vr,a deep neural network architecture, to analyse facial affect in the presence of a severe occlusion from a VR headset with a high level of accuracy. We simulate an occlusion representing a VR headset and apply it to all datasets in this work. EmoFAN-Vrpredicts both discrete and continuous emotions in one step, meaning it can be used in real-time deployment. We fine-tune our network on the AffectNet dataset under VR occlusion and test it on the AFEW-VA dataset, setting a new baseline for this dataset whilst under VR occlusion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750297/,2021 IEEE Third International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (CogMI),13-15 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICIEA.2017.8283069,Validated ground penetrating radar simulation model for estimating rebar location in infrastructure monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"Biogenic sulphide corrosion of reinforced concrete sewer pipes is an ongoing problem for wastewater governing bodies. Ensuring Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) is also an issue due to the harsh nature of sewer environments. As such, research into technologies that allow for automatic unmanned site assessments are of major priority to wastewater managing utilities. The use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is currently being investigated for it's ability to provide subsurface images. However, the GPR technology has not been tested and validated in harsh sewer environments. It is anticipated that the GPR interpretation can be hindered by low signal to noise ratio. As data driven machine learning techniques have proven to work in higly challenging data, our intenetion is to apply such techniques in GPR data processing. However, this is hindered by the lack of large amount of training data as it is prohibitively hard to collect such real experimental testing data. Thus, the aim of this study is to validate a ground penetrating radar simulation software, gprMax, and test it for suitability in generating realistic, big data sets with which to train the aforementioned data driven machine learning models supplemented with actual sewer crown data.

These factors affect vehicle drivers negatively as they contribute to stress, health problems, and wastefulness of time. This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets. A Bayesian Network is generated from the water level sensors and image processing data which provides possible reroute areas to avoid traffic congestion and flooded areas. All data are sent to a cloud platform through the Internet that can be accessed through a mobile user interface. This mobile user application provides information about the condition of the streets and possible reroute maps to users. The accuracy of the system is tested by actual implementation on a specific road. Results showed minimum accessing delay from using the ArRoad to navigate in rerouted paths to prevent impassable roads due to heavy traffic and flood. If effect, it lessens the amount of time experienced by drivers from heavy traffic condition and flooded streets which then improves the quality of life by preventing waste of resources such as time and money.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8229368/,2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE),24-27 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/MLSP.2019.8918913,Voice Anonymization in Urban Sound Recordings,IEEE,Conferences,"Monitoring health and noise pollution in urban environments often entails deploying acoustic sensor networks to passively collect data in public spaces. Although spaces are technically public, people in the environment may not fully realize the degree to which they may be recorded by the sensor network, which may be perceived as a violation of expected privacy. Therefore, we propose a method to anonymize and blur the voices of people recorded in public spaces-a novel, yet increasingly important task as acoustic sensing becomes ubiquitous in sensor-equipped smart cities. This method is analogous to Google's face blurring in its Street View photographs, which arose from similar concerns in the visual domain. The proposed blurring method aims to anonymize voices by removing both the linguistic content and personal identity from voices, while preserving the rest of the acoustic scene.The method consists of a three-step process. First, voices are separated from non-voice content by a deep U-Net source separation model. Second, we evaluate two approaches to obscure the identity and intelligibility of the extracted voices: a low pass filter to remove most of the formants in the voices, and an inversion of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Finally, the blurred vocal content is mixed with the separated non-vocal signal to reconstruct the acoustic scene. Using background recordings from a real urban acoustic sensor network in New York City, we present a complete evaluation of our method, with automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, sound event detection, and human perceptual evaluation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918913/,2019 IEEE 29th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP),13-16 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Through quantitative study, we show that traditional approaches to event detection have difficulty meeting such requirements. Specifically, they cannot explore the detection capability of a deployed system and choose the right sensors, homogeneous or heterogeneous, to meet user specified detection accuracy. They also cannot dynamically adapt the detection capability to runtime observations to save energy. Therefore, we are motivated to propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption. Through evaluation with vehicle detection trace data and a building traffic monitoring testbed of IRIS motes, we demonstrate the superior performance of Watchdog over existing solutions in terms of meeting user specified detection accuracy and energy savings.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5465987/,2010 16th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium,12-15 April 2010,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The benefits of data mining lie in the extraction of new knowledge automatically from the raw data to progress decision making.

These parameters are taken for each sample of water in each ten water stations that selected for the investigations.

The experiment was carried on a real database validated by (Iraqi Ministry of Environment) gathered from ten authenticated treatment stations. The results show that using C4.5 decision tree classifier found to be the better in terms of the execution time while using NNT algorithm gave slightly better results in terms of the accuracy and error percentages.

10.1109/CCA.2000.897405,Winner take all experts network for sensor validation,IEEE,Conferences,"The validation of sensor measurements has become an integral part of the operation and control of modern industrial equipment. The sensor under a harsh environment must be shown to consistently provide the correct measurements. Analysis of the validation hardware or software should trigger an alarm when the sensor signals deviate appreciably from the correct values. Neural network based models can be used to estimate critical sensor values when neighboring sensor measurements are used as inputs. The discrepancy between the measured and predicted sensor values may then be used as an indicator for sensor health. The proposed winner take all experts (WTAE) network is based on a 'divide and conquer' strategy. It employs a growing fuzzy clustering algorithm to divide a complicated problem into a series of simpler sub-problems and assigns an expert to each of them locally. After the sensor approximation, the outputs from the estimator and the real sensor value are compared both in the time domain and the frequency domain. Three fault indicators are used to provide analytical redundancy to detect the sensor failure. In the decision stage, the intersection of three fuzzy sets accomplishes a decision level fusion, which indicates the confidence level of the sensor health. Two data sets, the Spectra Quest Machinery Fault Simulator data set and the Westland vibration data set, were used in simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed WTAE network.

Supervised machine learning algorithms have become especially successful in many industries including health, legal, security, finance, travel, and others. Training supervised learning algorithms, however, is expensive because the real world contains a very large number of different classes that need to be covered by the training set. This is especially true for the highly variable, multi-user workload data produced by the strategically vital big data and cloud software stacks. It is very important, however, to be able to accurately classify these complex workloads in order to enable autonomic management and optimization. Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is an advanced machine learning approach that enables classification of objects without having to explicitly train on examples of those objects. In this paper we present a new ZSL technique intended to reduce the expense of assembling workload training sets for big data analytic workloads. We demonstrate that multi-user big data workloads can be treated as hybrids of simpler, single-user workload classes, and classified accurately without having to explicitly train on example instances of multi-user workloads. Our technique is able to accurately classify both unseen multi-user workloads, and seen single-user workloads using the same classifier.

Nevertheless, it is notorious the absence of a practical gadget or methodology that satisfies the requirements focus on a portable and comfortable BP monitoring system. The objective of this research is the design and development of a wireless communication prototype, based on a physical arterial blood pressure monitor which will be able to send data to a web server due to an integrated ESP8266 Wifi interconnection module. This article presents the prototype design, technological integration and components implemented. While it is true that multiple monitoring systems have been developed, in this case there are highlighted some machine learning algorithms associated with monitoring of BP measurements. This proves a technological integration which involves data collection in the cloud, pervasive computing, embedded systems and data analysis. These algorithms are still a work in progress and will be published as a E-heartBP continuation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8908647/,"2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)",25-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Existing approaches for automatic eating detection using wearable sensors often require custom hardware that may not be practical as their usability and energy efficiency have not been validated. In this paper, we propose to use off-the-shelf Bluetooth headsets to unobtrusively monitor and detect users' eating episodes by analyzing the chewing sound. The challenges of using commodity acoustic hardware include the limited sampling rate that reduces feature fidelity and the impact of environment noise in real-world settings. Our experimental results show that the traditional kernel-based approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) could achieve 94-95% classification accuracy in lab settings, though the detection performance quickly degraded to 65-76% for in-the-field testing. We then propose a novel Deep Learning based classification technique that drastically improved detection accuracy to 77-94% despite the existence of ambient noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Bluetooth headsets to detect eating episodes and to use Deep Learning to significantly increase classification performance in this context. We believe that the adoption of readily available and low-cost consumer devices provides a foundation for practical deployment of automated dietary monitoring applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545830/,"2016 IEEE First International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)",27-29 June 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Two of the main expectations of 5G networks are that they will be able to handle ultra-high-definition (UHD) video streaming and that they will deliver services that meet the requirements of the end user's perceived quality by adopting quality of experience (QoE) aware network management approaches. This paper proposes a 5G-QoE framework to address the QoE modeling for UHD video flows in 5G networks. Particularly, it focuses on providing a QoE prediction model that is both sufficiently accurate and of low enough complexity to be employed as a continuous real-time indicator of the “health” of video application flows at the scale required in future 5G networks. The model has been developed and implemented as part of the EU 5G PPP SELFNET autonomic management framework, where it provides a primary indicator of the likely perceptual quality of UHD video application flows traversing a realistic multi-tenanted 5G mobile edge network testbed. The proposed 5G-QoE framework has been implemented in the 5G testbed, and the high accuracy of QoE prediction has been validated through comparing the predicted QoE values with not only subjective testing results but also empirical measurements in the testbed. As such, 5G-QoE would enable a holistic video flow self-optimisation system employing the cutting-edge Scalable H.265 video encoding to transmit UHD video applications in a QoE-aware manner.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8332093/,IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting,June 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Considering private medical data storage, secure access to such wearable devices becomes a crucial necessity. Exploiting the ECG sensors present on wearable devices, we investigate the possibility of using ECG as the individually unique source for device authentication. In particular, we propose to use ECG features toward both cardiac monitoring and neural-networkbased biometric authentication. For such complex functionalities to be seamlessly integrated in wearable devices, an accurate algorithm must be implemented with ultralow power and a small form factor. In this paper, a smart ECG processor is presented for ECG-based authentication as well as cardiac monitoring. Data-driven Lasso regression and low-precision techniques are developed to compress neural networks for feature extraction by 24.4×.

Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way. The possibility of semantic interoperability is taken into account by integrating ADDO and a heterogeneous AD dataset. We used ADNI as a case study to mapping a set of real instances. To manage the medical domain's uncertainty, ADDO is extended to fuzzy ontology to accommodate the medical linguistic variables and enhance diagnosis results' efficiency. ADDO is constructed using Protégé 5.5.0 software and evaluated using the HermiT reasoner and SPARQL semantic queries.

10.1109/TASE.2021.3077537,A Hybrid Prediction Method for Realistic Network Traffic With Temporal Convolutional Network and LSTM,IEEE,Journals,"Accurate and real-time prediction of network traffic can not only help system operators allocate resources rationally according to their actual business needs but also help them assess the performance of a network and analyze its health status. In recent years, neural networks have been proved suitable to predict time series data, represented by the model of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and a temporal convolutional network (TCN). This article proposes a novel hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM) for such network traffic prediction, which synergistically combines the power of the Savitzky&#x2013;Golay (SG) filter, the TCN, as well as the LSTM. ST-LSTM employs a three-phase end-to-end methodology serving time series prediction. It first eliminates noise in raw data using the SG filter, then extracts short-term features from sequences applying the TCN, and then captures the long-term dependence in the data exploiting the LSTM. Experimental results over real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ST-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;This work considers real-time and high-accuracy prediction of network traffic. It is highly important to well predict network traffic by capturing long-term dependence and effectively extracting high- and low-frequency information from time series data. Yet, it is a big challenge to achieve it because there are unstable characteristics and strong nonlinear features in the network traffic due to continuous expansion of network scale and fast emergence of new services. Current prediction methods usually have oversimplified theoretical assumptions, need significant time and memory, or suffer problems of gradient disappearance or early convergence. Thus, they fail to effectively capture the nonlinear characteristics of large-scale network sequences. This work proposes a hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM), which integrates the merits of the Savitzky&#x2013;Golay filter, the temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the long short-term memory (LSTM), serving as smoothing time series, capturing short-term local features, and capturing long-term dependence, respectively. Experimental results based on the real-life dataset demonstrate that it achieves better prediction accuracy than its state-of-the-art peers, including the TCN and the LSTM.

This has promoted rapid development of the aircraft engine industry, increasing the aircraft engine safety, reliability and intelligence. At present, the aero-engine data computing and processing platform used in the industrial Internet of things is not complete, and the numerical calculation and control of aero-engine are inseparable from the linear model, while the existing aero-engine model linearization method is not accurate enough to quickly calculate the dynamic process parameters of the engine. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a linear model of turbofan engine for intelligent analysis in IIoT, with the aim to provide a new perspective for the analysis of engine dynamics. The construction of the proposed model includes three steps: First, a nonlinear mathematical model of a turbofan engine is established by adopting the component modeling approach. Then, numerous parameters of the turbofan engine components and their operating data are obtained by simulating various working conditions. Finally, based on the simulated data for the engine under these conditions, the model at the points during the dynamic process is linearized, such that a dynamic real-time linearized model of turbofan engine is obtained.

Cough assessment has been limited so far to subjective measurement tools or uncomfortable (i.e., non-wearable) cough monitors. This limits the potential of real-time cough monitoring to improve respiratory care. Objective: This paper presents a machine hearing system for audio-based robust cough segmentation that can be easily deployed in mobile scenarios. Methods: Cough detection is performed in two steps. First, a short-term spectral feature set is separately computed in five predefined frequency bands: [0, 0.5), [0.5, 1), [1, 1.5), [1.5, 2), and [2, 5.5125] kHz. Feature selection and combination are then applied to make the short-term feature set robust enough in different noisy scenarios. Second, high-level data representation is achieved by computing the mean and standard deviation of short-term descriptors in 300 ms long-term frames. Finally, cough detection is carried out using a support vector machine trained with data from different noisy scenarios. The system is evaluated using a patient signal database which emulates three real-life scenarios in terms of noise content. Results: The system achieves 92.71% sensitivity, 88.58% specificity, and 90.69% Area Under Receiver Operating Charcteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Our research outcome paves the way to create a device for cough monitoring in real-life situations.

Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques.

Fitness trackers have become popular which record steps taken and distance, typically using a fixed stride length.

Walking speed is closely linked to morbidity in patients and widely used for medical assessment via measured walking. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a standard assessment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Current generation smartphone hardware contains similar sensor chips as in medical devices and popular fitness devices. We developed a middleware software, MoveSense, which runs on standalone smartphones while providing comparable readings to medical accelerometers. We evaluate six machine learning methods to obtain gait speed during natural walking training models to predict natural walking speed and distance during a 6MWT with 28 pulmonary patients and ten subjects without pulmonary condition.

Our universally trained support vector machine models produce 6MWT distance with 3.23% error during a controlled 6MWT and 11.2% during natural free walking.

Providing high-intensity rehabilitation sessions or home assistance through low-cost robotic devices can be indeed an effective solution to democratize services otherwise not accessible to everyone.

Manual weedicide spray through bag-pack is hazardous to human health. Localized autonomous weedicide spray through aerial spraying units can help save water, weedicide chemical and effect less on human health. Such systems require multi-spectral cues to classify crop, weed, and soil surface. Our focus in this paper is on the detection of weeds in the sugar beet crop, using air-borne multispectral camera sensors, which is considered as an alternative crop to sugarcane to obtain sugar in Pakistan. We developed a new framework for weed identification; a patch-based classification approach as appose to semantic segmentation that is more realistic for real-time intelligent aerial spraying systems. Our approach converts 3-class pixel classification problem into a 2-class crop-weed patch classification problem which in turns improves crop and weed classification accuracy. For classification, we developed a new VGG-Beet convolutional neural network (CNN), which is based on generic VGG16 (visual graphics group) CNN model with 11 convolutional layers. For experiments, we captured a sugar beet dataset with 3-channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.2 cm/pixel and a height of 4 meters. For better comparison, we used two publicly available sugar beet crop aerial imagery datasets, captured using a 5-channel multispectral sensor and a 4-Channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance of 1cm and a height of 10 meters.

Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data.

10.1109/JSYST.2019.2921867,A Smart Optimization of Fault Diagnosis in Electrical Grid Using Distributed Software-Defined IoT System,IEEE,Journals,"Electrical power demands have increased significantly over the last years due to rapid increase in air conditioning units and home appliances per domestic unit, particularly in Iraq. Having an uninterrupted power supply is essential for the continuity of power-generated home services and industrial platforms. Currently, in Iraq, electrical power interruption has become a big concern to the utility suppliers. Despite successive attempts to put an end to this dilemma, the issue still prevails. One of the main factors in power outages in local zones is persistent faults in distribution transformers (DTs). DT is considered one of the main elements in the electrical network that is essential for the reliability of the grid supply. Due to the internal lack of monitoring system and periodic maintenance, DT is relentlessly subject to faults due to high overhead utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance the grid reliability, transformer health check, and maintenance practices, we propose a remote condition Internet of Things monitoring and fault prediction system that is based on a customized software-defined networking (SDN) technology. This approach is a transition to smart grid implementation by fusing the power grid with efficient and real-time wireless communication architecture. The SDN implementation is considered in two phases: one is a controller installed per local zone and the other is the main controller that is installed between zones and connected to the core network. The core network consists of redundant links to recover from any future fails. Furthermore, we propose a prediction system based on an artificial neural network algorithm, called distribution transformer fault prediction, that is installed in the management plane for periodic prediction based on real-time sensor traffic to our proposed cloud. Moreover, we propose a communication protocol in the local zone called local SDN-sense. The SDN-sense ensures a reliable communication and local node selection to relay DT sensor data to the main controller. Our proposed architecture showcases an efficient approach to handle future interruption and faults in power grid using cost-effective and reliable infrastructure that can predict and provide real-time health monitoring indices for the Iraqi grid network with minimal power interruptions. After extensive testing, the prediction accuracy was about 96.1%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8746591/,IEEE Systems Journal,June 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/JBHI.2019.2891729,A Smartphone Application for Automated Decision Support in Cognitive Task Based Evaluation of Central Nervous System Motor Disorders,IEEE,Journals,"Background and Objective: New technology enables constant boost to the powers of mobile devices, which in the previous years have transformed from simple mobile phones to smart phones. Computational powers of these electronics enable actions that previously were possible only for computers. By the use of special applications, we may benefit from sensors and multimedia capabilities of operating systems. Therefore, a new era for devoted implementations opens, in which a smart application can take a role of computing system to estimate the symptoms of diseases by evaluating signals coming from a human body. Methods: We propose a model of an application implemented for mobile android systems, which can be used for examination of central nervous system motor disorders occurring in patients suffering from Huntington (HD), Alzheimer, or Parkinson diseases. In particular, the model tracks tremors (involuntary movements), and cognitive (memory loss or dementia) impairments using touch and visual stimulus modalities. The proposed model interprets the symptoms from human bodies that indicate one of the diseases of the nervous system. Pre-processing of collected data for feature extraction is executed on a mobile device by using core functionality and methods provided in android's application programming interface. The information is evaluated by a back-propagation neural network classifier and the result is presented to the end user. The system is able to contact medical supervision and provide an assistance from the clinic. Results: The system uses a collected dataset of 1928 records, taken from 11 HD patients and 11 healthy persons in Lithuania, to gather statistics about examinations and presents the results as medical evaluation with prediction on the state of health. The accuracy of recognition of early, prodromal symptoms for central nervous system motor disorders is 86.4% (F-measure 0.859). The app (available on Google Play) is easy to use and is efficient tool for decision support in medical examinations. Conclusions: The use of intelligent apps which can help to evaluate neurodegenerative disorders is an important enhancement to medical diagnosis.

10.1109/TCBB.2017.2780106,A Sparse Regression Method for Group-Wise Feature Selection with False Discovery Rate Control,IEEE,Journals,"The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, or SLOPE, is a sparse regression method recently introduced by Bogdan et. al. [1] . It can be used to identify significant predictor variables in a linear model that may have more unknown parameters than observations. When the correlations between predictor variables are small, the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the expected proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. However, the requirement for nearly uncorrelated predictors is too restrictive for genomic data, as demonstrated in our recent study [2] by an application of SLOPE to realistic simulated DNA sequence data. A possible solution is to divide the predictor variables into nearly uncorrelated groups, and to modify the procedure to select entire groups with an overall significant group effect, rather than individual predictors. Following this motivation, we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genomic data. Our theoretical results show that Group SLOPE controls the group-wise false discovery rate (gFDR), when groups are orthogonal to each other. For use in non-orthogonal settings, we propose two types of Monte Carlo based heuristics, which lead to gFDR control with Group SLOPE in simulations based on real SNP data. As an illustration of the merits of this method, an application of Group SLOPE to a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study results in the identification of some known DNA sequence regions associated with bone health, as well as some new candidate regions. The novel methods are implemented in the R package grpSLOPEMC , which is publicly available at https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPEMC.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8166765/,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,1 July-Aug. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Because bad air quality brings prominent effects on our daily life, how to forecast future air quality accurately and tenuously has emerged as a priority for guaranteeing the quality of human life in many urban areas worldwide. Existing models usually neglect the influence of wind and do not consider both distance and similarity to select the most related stations, which can provide significant information in prediction. Therefore, we propose a Geographic Self-Organizing Map (GeoSOM) spatiotemporal gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, which clusters all the monitor stations into several clusters by geographical coordinates and time-series features. For each cluster, we build a GRU model and weighted different models with the Gaussian vector weights to predict the target sequence.

Fall detection system (FDS) that alerts caregivers or family members can potentially save lives of the elderly. However, conventional FDS involves wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This article presents a passive device-free FDS based on commodity WiFi framework for smart home, which is mainly composed of two modules in terms of hardware platform and client application. Concretely, commercial WiFi devices collect disturbance signal induced by human motions from smart home and transmit the data to a data analysis platform for further processing. Based on this basis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is used to eliminate the influence of random noise presented in the collected data. Next, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is utilized to classify human motions and identify the fall status automatically. By leveraging Web Application Programming Interface (API), the analyzed data is able to be uploaded to the proxy server from which the client application then obtains the corresponding fall information. Moreover, the system has been implemented as a consumer mobile App that can help the elderly saving their lives in smart home, and detection performance of the proposed FDS has been evaluated by conducting comprehensive experiments on real-world dataset.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the incompatibility problem of herbs is a great challenge to clinical medication safety, which becomes a serious threat to public health. In this paper, a new ANti-community detection algorithm based on the DEgree and the RATio between the Inner degree and the Outer degree of a Node (ANDERATION), is proposed, in which these two factors are firstly introduced to detect anti-community structure by first creating the initial anti-community structure and then maximizing the objective function.

Previous approaches to human-centred applications using the TSA usually relied on the use of a fixed sensor location to make the human-sensor distance and the human presence shape fixed. However, placing this sensor in different locations and new indoor environments can pose a significant challenge. In this paper, a novel framework based on a deep convolutional encoder-decoder network is proposed to address this challenge in real-life deployment.

Big-data processing and AI algorithms are at the heart of autonomics research groups among industry and academia. Major advances in the field have traditionally focused on algorithmic research and increasing the performance of the developed algorithms. However, it has been recently recognized by the AI community that the applicability of these algorithms and their consideration in context is of paramount importance for their adoption. Current approaches to address AI in context lie in two areas: adaptive systems research that mainly focuses on implementing adaptivity mechanisms (technical perspective) and AI in context research that focuses on business aspects (business perspective). There is currently no approach that combines all aspects required from business considerations to an appropriate level of abstraction. In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of designing adaptive systems and therefore providing AI in context by utilising DSL technology. We propose a new DSL (AdaptiveSystems) and a methodology to apply this to the creation of a DSL for specific application domains such as AdaptiveVLE (Adaptive Virtual Learning Environment) DSL.

In this article, we present “AirScope,” a mobile sensing system that employs cooperative robots to monitor the indoor air quality. Since the wireless coverage can be incomplete in some indoor areas, AirScope allows the robots to defer uploading the data to the central server by utilizing their own data buffers. In order to guarantee the timeliness of the data in the server, AirScope aims to minimize the average data latency by properly planning the routes of the robots. Such a route planning strategy has to be implemented in a distributed way since the robots that are out of wireless coverage can only make plans on their own. In addition, the cooperation of the robots is also necessary because the aggregation of the robots in a small area increases the average data latency of the other unattended areas. To solve this distributed and cooperative routing planning problem, we propose a solution based on distributed deep Q-learning (DDQL). We evaluate the system performance by simulations and real-world experiments. The results show that AirScope is effective to reduce data latency, where the proposed DDQL is 8% better than the greedy algorithm and 24% better than the random strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9123492/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients' medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims.

However, traditional fault diagnosis methods usually adopt manual feature extraction, which not only costs expensively and depends on prior knowledge. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of automatic fault identification based on the original vibration signals. Recently, existing studies have shown that most of fault diagnoses are implemented by using deep neural network. Although these methods have achieved satisfactory performances, there are obvious limitations in real applications, that is, the complexity of deep neural network requires a lot of hardware computing resources. This hinders the development of online fault diagnosis tools. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model based on lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNet, and realizes an end-to-end intelligent fault classification and diagnosis application.

In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploring the use of machine learning techniques in automating and enhancing the effectiveness of malware detection and analysis. In this paper, we present a deep recurrent neural network solution as a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) with a pre-training as a regularization method to avoid random network initialization. In our proposed approach, we use global and short dependencies of the inputs. With pre-training, we avoid random initialization and are able to improve the accuracy and robustness of malware threat hunting. The proposed method speeds up the convergence, in comparison to the stacked LSTM, by reducing the length of malware OpCode or bytecode sequences. Hence, the complexity of our final method is reduced. This leads to better accuracy, higher Mattews Correlation Coefficients (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC) in comparison to a standard LSTM with similar detection time. Our proposed method can be applied in real-time malware threat hunting, particularly, for safety critical systems, such as electronic health or Internet of Battlefield / Military of Things, where poor convergence of the model could lead to catastrophic consequences.

Covid-19 has also catalysed digital transformation across the sector for improving operational efficiencies. As a result, the amount of digitally stored patient data such as discharge letters, scan images, test results or free text entries by doctors has grown significantly. In 2020, 2314 exabytes of medical data was generated globally.

The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS. The designed system considers the ontology semantic similarity of diabetes complications and symptoms concepts in the fuzzy rules' evaluation process. The framework was tested using a real data set, and the results indicate how the proposed system helps physicians and patients to accurately diagnose diabetes mellitus.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8403911/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It includes sophisticated applications such as malpractice detection in the examination, distracted driving, gesture detection, etc., and requires robust and reliable pose estimation techniques. These applications help to map the attention of the user with head pose estimation (HPE) metrics supported by emotion and gaze analysis. This paper solves the problem of attention score estimation with HPE. The proposed method ensures ease of implementation while addressing head pose estimation using 68 facial features. Further, to attain reliability and precision, head pose estimation has been implemented as a regression task. The coordinate pair angle method (CPAM) with deep neural network (DNN) regression and elastic net regression is carried out. The use of DNN ensures precision on low lighting, distorted or occluded images. CPAM methodology leverages facial landmark detection and angular difference to estimate head pose.

Particularly, online forecasting of the structural responses under extreme external loading conditions (e.g., earthquakes) takes a significant role in SHM to provide early warning and ensure safe operation. In practice, complex causality and intrinsic interactions between seismic excitation and structural response make it challenging to establish a reliable predictive scheme. The present paper proposes a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model implemented in the architecture of a time-series attention-based RNN encoder–decoder (TSA-RNN-ED), for predictive analysis of structural responses under seismic excitation. In the proposed data-driven model, upcoming sequential responses are predicted through sequence-to-sequence learning from historical multivariate time-series signals. A time-series attention mechanism is proposed to exploit the heterogeneous, but directly related, hidden features between the seismic loads and the corresponding structural responses. The proposed architecture can reliably regress excitation-response interactions to predict dynamic responses subjected to future earthquakes while satisfying the need of real-time forecasting for on-site practical implementation. This article systematically evaluates the proposed model by using two real-world structural cases: 1) the tallest building in China, the Shanghai Tower and 2) a woodframe classroom on a shake table at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

Such a learning model is able to assess health states in real time provided that both training and testing samples are complete and have the same probability distribution. However, it is rare and difficult in practical applications to meet these requirements due to the continuous change in working conditions. Besides, conventional hyperparameters tuning via grid search or manual tuning requires a lot of human intervention and becomes inflexible for users. Two objectives are targeted in this work. In an attempt to remedy the data distribution mismatch issue, we firstly introduce a feature extraction and selection approach built upon correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction. Secondly, to diminish human intervention burdens, we propose an Automatic artificial Neural network with an Augmented Hidden Layer (Auto-NAHL) for the classification of health states. Within the designed network, it is worthy to mention that the novelty of the implemented neural architecture is attributed to the new multiple feature mappings of the inputs, where such configuration allows the hidden layer to learn multiple representations from several random linear mappings and produce a single final efficient representation. Hyperparameters tuning including the network architecture, is fully automated by incorporating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The designed learning process is evaluated on a complex industrial plant as well as various classification problems.

Wearable technologies and m-health solutions can support the person, the medical specialist, and long-term care facilities to efficiently implement personalised therapy solutions by monitoring the stress level of each subject during the motor and cognitive training. In this paper we present a comprehensive work on this topic, starting from a pilot study involving a group of frail older adults suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who actively participated in cognitive and motor rehabilitation sessions equipped with wearable physiological sensors and a mobile application for physiological monitoring. We analyse the collected data to investigate the stress response of frail older subjects during the therapy, and how the cognitive training is positively affected by physical exercise.

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework.

To eliminate subjectivity and enhance diagnostic accuracy, we present a diagnostic tool for nine ear conditions in a computer-aided diagnosis scheme. We propose a hybrid learning framework based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks for video otoscopy analysis. The proposed method first extracts the deep features of each relevant frame from the video.

Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241785/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TIM.2021.3128703,DU-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks With Dual-Domain U-Net-Based Discriminators for Low-Dose CT Denoising,IEEE,Journals,"Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has drawn major attention in the medical imaging field due to the potential health risks of CT-associated X-ray radiation to patients. Reducing the radiation dose, however, decreases the quality of the reconstructed images, which consequently compromises the diagnostic performance. Over the past few years, various deep learning techniques, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been introduced to improve the image quality of LDCT images through denoising, achieving impressive results over traditional approaches. GAN-based denoising methods usually leverage an additional classification network, i.e., discriminator, to learn the most discriminate difference between the denoised and normal-dose images and, hence, regularize the denoising model accordingly; it often focuses either on the global structure or local details. To better regularize the LDCT denoising model, this article proposes a novel method, termed DU-GAN, which leverages U-Net-based discriminators in the GAN framework to learn both global and local differences between the denoised and normal-dose images in both image and gradient domains. The merit of such a U-Net-based discriminator is that it can not only provide the per-pixel feedback to the denoising network through the outputs of the U-Net but also focus on the global structure in a semantic level through the middle layer of the U-Net. In addition to the adversarial training in the image domain, we also apply another U-Net-based discriminator in the image gradient domain to alleviate the artifacts caused by photon starvation and enhance the edge of the denoised CT images. Furthermore, the CutMix technique enables the per-pixel outputs of the U-Net-based discriminator to provide radiologists with a confidence map to visualize the uncertainty of the denoised results, facilitating the LDCT-based screening and diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance over recently published methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to accurately predict the air quality index, using environmental monitoring data together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air quality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced with a novel non-linear autoregressive neural network with exogenous input model, especially designed for time series prediction.

According to operating experience data and the type of mining machine, total loss failure rates per machine fleet can reach up to 30%. Vibration analysis techniques are commonly used for condition monitoring and early detection of unforeseen failures to generate predictive maintenance plans for heavy machinery. However, this maintenance strategy is intensively used only for stationary machines and/or mobile machinery in stationary operations. Today, there is a lack of proper solutions to detect and prevent critical failures for non-stationary machinery. This paper shows a cost-effective solution proposal for implementing a vibration sensor network with wireless communication and machine learning data-driven capabilities for condition monitoring of non-stationary heavy machinery in mining operations. During the machine operation, 3-axis accelerations were measured using two sensors deployed across the machine. The machine accelerations (amplitudes and frequencies) are measured in two different frequency spectrums to improve each sensing location's time resolution. Multiple machine learning algorithms use this machine data to assess conditions according to manufacturer recommendations and operational benchmarks Proposed data-driven machine learning models classify the machine condition in states according to the ISO 2372 standards for vibration severity: Good, Acceptable, Unsatisfactory, or Unacceptable. After performing field tests with bulldozers and backhoes from different manufacturers, the machine learning algorithms are able to classify machine health status with an accuracy between 85% - 95%. Moreover, the system allows early detection of “Unacceptable” states between 120 to 170 hours prior to critical failure.

A penicillin fermentation process is a highly complex and nonlinear dynamic process with batch processing. A data-driven approach is utilized for fault diagnostics due to the availability of huge batch processing data and the unavailability of an analytical model. To address the non-linearity, a subspace-aided parity-based residual generation technique is proposed by using a just-in-time learning approach. For the just-in-time learning approach, the most similar data samples are selected from the database for incoming test samples and a subspace aided parity-based residual is generated using these samples. The designed fault detection technique is implemented for the penicillin fermentation process to demonstrate real-time health monitoring of the process under sensor noise and process disturbances. Two sensor faults and an actuator fault are considered and successfully detected using the proposed technique.

Most devices in a smart home access the Internet through a home gateway (HGW). In this paper, we propose a software-definednetwork (SDN)-HGW framework to better manage distributed smart home networks and support the SDN controller of the core network. The SDN controller enables efficient network quality-of-service management based on real-time traffic monitoring and resource allocation of the core network. However, it cannot provide network management in distributed smart homes. Our proposed SDN-HGW extends the control to the access network, i.e., a smart home network, for better end-to-end network management. Specifically, the proposed SDN-HGW can achieve distributed application awareness by classifying data traffic in a smart home network. Most existing traffic classification solutions, e.g., deep packet inspection, cannot provide real-time application awareness for encrypted data traffic. To tackle those issues, we develop encrypted data classifiers (denoted as DataNets) based on three deep learning schemes, i.e., multilayer perceptron, stacked autoencoder, and convolutional neural networks, using an open data set that has over 200 000 encrypted data samples from 15 applications. A data preprocessing scheme is proposed to process raw data packets and the tested data set so that DataNet can be created.

Applications in logistics or ridesharing will require a specific year of service rather than the conventional mileage usage. Reliable operations of the electronic systems must be assured at all times, regardless of the usage condition. A more dynamic and on-demand way of assuring the system availability will have to be developed. This article proposes a thermomechanical stress-based prognostics method as a potential solution. The goal is achieved by several novel advancements. On the experimental front, a key microelectronics package is developed to directly apply the prognostics and health management concept using a piezoresistive silicon-based stress sensor. Additional hardware for safe and secure data transmission and data processing is also developed, which is critically required for recording in situ and real-time data. On the data management front, proper data-driven approaches have to be identified to handle the unique dataset from the stress sensor employed in this study. The approaches effectively handle the massive amount of data that reveals the important information and automation of the prognostic process and thus to be able to detect, classify, locate, and predict the failure. The statistical techniques for diagnostics and the machine learning algorithms for health assessment and prognostics are also determined to implement the approaches in a simple, fast, but accurate way within the capacity of limited computing power.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in COx sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the second strategy, a neural network-based strategy is implemented as an intelligent controller for the proposed system. To evaluate the performance of these two real-time strategies, a performance metric based on the battery state-of-health (SoH) is developed to reveal the relative impact of instantaneous battery currents on the battery degradation.

Current security mechanisms detect insider threats, but they are ill-suited to monitor systems in which users function in dynamic teams. In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors. When the number of illicit users is low, MetaCADS is the best model, but as the number grows, commonly accessed semantics lead to hiding in a crowd, such that CADS is more prudent.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133296/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,May-June 2012,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the final network achieves above 97% testing accuracy and outperforms other relevant models, demonstrating that it can detect a large amount of antivaccine messages posted daily.

The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094354/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The cost in terms of human lives lost is devastating on account of the high contagiousness and mortality rate of the virus. Millions of people have been infected, frequently requiring continuous assistance and monitoring. Smart healthcare technologies and Artificial Intelligence algorithms constitute promising solutions useful not only for the monitoring of patient care but also in order to support the early diagnosis, prevention and evaluation of Covid-19 in a faster and more accurate way. On the other hand, the necessity to realise reliable and precise smart healthcare solutions, able to acquire and process voice signals by means of appropriate Internet of Things devices in real-time, requires the identification of algorithms able to discriminate accurately between pathological and healthy subjects. In this paper, we explore and compare the performance of the main machine learning techniques in terms of their ability to correctly detect Covid-19 disorders through voice analysis. Several studies report, in fact, significant effects of this virus on voice production due to the considerable impairment of the respiratory apparatus. Vocal folds oscillations that are more asynchronous, asymmetrical and restricted are observed during phonation in Covid-19 patients. Voice sounds selected by the Coswara database, an available crowd-sourced database, have been e analysed and processed to evaluate the capacity of the main ML techniques to distinguish between healthy and pathological voices.

Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard of detecting OSA, requires multiple specialized sensors for signal collection, hence patients have to physically visit hospitals and bear the costly treatment for a single detection. Recently, many single-sensor alternatives have been proposed to improve the cost efficiency and convenience. Among these methods, solutions based on RR-interval (i.e., the interval between two consecutive pulses) signals reach a satisfactory balance among comfort, portability and detection accuracy. In this paper, we advance RR-interval based OSA detection by considering its real-world practicality from energy perspectives. As photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse sensors are commonly equipped on smart wrist-worn wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and wristbands), the energy efficiency of the detection model is crucial to fully support an overnight observation on patients. This creates challenges as the PPG sensors are unable to keep collecting continuous signals due to the limited battery capacity on smart wrist-worn devices. Therefore, we propose a novel Frequency Extraction Network (FENet), which can extract features from different frequency bands of the input RR-interval signals and generate continuous detection results with downsampled, discontinuous RR-interval signals. With the help of the one-to-multiple structure, FENet requires only one-third of the operation time of the PPG sensor, thus sharply cutting down the energy consumption and enabling overnight diagnosis. Experimental results on real OSA datasets reveal the state-of-the-art performance of FENet.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9320528/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Aug. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces.

Most machine learning methods achieve good results based on the assumption of data balance. However, the scarce fault data of harmonic drive is difficult to collect, resulting in various imbalanced health status samples, which has an adverse effect on fault diagnosis. In this article, we propose a data generation method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to solve the problem of data imbalance and utilize the multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to realize the fault diagnosis of the harmonic drive. First, the data collected from three vibration acceleration sensors are preprocessed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the frequency spectrum of the vibration signal. Second, multiple GANs were adopted to generate various fault spectrum data and the data selection module (DSM) is elaborately designed to filter and purify these data. Third, the filtered generated data will be combined with the real data to form a balanced dataset, and then the MSCNN is used to achieve multiclassification of the health status of the harmonic drive. Finally, the experiments have been implemented on an industrial robot vibration test bench to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

The smart devices promise to improve human life through improved safety and security through the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, optimization of power grids, and applications in human health. Devices produce a large amount of data for analytic applications running inside a cloud infrastructure. Unlike core networks, the main objective of an attack on an IoT network is to disrupt the availability of IoT data for the applications by overwhelming devices with information requests. Detection of such an attack cannot be done either in the cloud where the analytical application runs nor on the IoT device itself due to its limited computational resources. Furthermore, the standard networking paradigm does not provide an easy way to instrument and control networking nodes, for an effective mitigation of identified threats.

In this paper, we presented, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth security analysis on home-use electroencephalography (EEG) IoT devices. Our key contributions are twofold. First, we reverse-engineered the home-use EEG system framework via which we identified the design and implementation flaws. By exploiting these flaws, we developed two sets of novel easy-to-exploit PoC attacks, which consist of four remote attacks and one proximate attack. In a remote attack, an attacker can steal a user's brain wave data through a carefully crafted program while in the proximate attack, the attacker can steal a victim's brain wave data over-the-air without accessing the victim's device on any sense when he is close to the victim. As a result, all the 156 brain-computer interface (BCI) apps in the NeuroSky App store are vulnerable to the proximate attack. We also discovered that all the 31 free apps in the NeuroSky App store are vulnerable to at least one remote attack. Second, we proposed a novel deep learning model of a joint recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to infer a user's activities based on the reduced-featured EEG data stolen from the home-use EEG IoT devices, and our evaluation over the real-world EEG data indicates that the inference accuracy of the proposed RCNN is can reach 70.55%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8685117/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Aug. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The PPG data were decomposed using principal component analysis (PCA) and reconstructed using fixed energy retention.

This paper focuses on the hidden side effects of the increased usage of IoT, such as energy consumption, physical pollution, radiation, and health issues. We indicate that an evaluation system with carefully designed metrics reflecting the impact of IoT flood with input from academic, industry, and government is required. We propose some practical measures that can reduce the IoT flood, such as common platforms and data sharing to reduce the side effects. This paper demonstrates the IoT flood problem and potential solutions by examining the intelligent transport system domain where IoT is being deployed to solve problems related to time efficiency and energy consumption through smart mobility.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8506609/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It also helps to manage calorie intake by accounting for the amount of calorie consumed from beverages. While staying hydrated and controlling calorie intake is critical in both physical wellness and cognitive health, existing technologies do not provide a solution for monitoring both fluid type and fluid volume. To address this limitation, we present the design, implementation, and validation of Liquid Intake Detection System (LIDS) for real-time tracking of fluid intake type and volume. The system devises a sensing module that is composed of ultrasonic, RGB color, temperature, and accelerometer sensors as well as a computational framework for machine-learning-based fluid intake type classification, volume estimation, and bottle-state-recognition. The developed sensing unit is small and light-weight that can be mounted, from inside, on the lid of a drinking bottle. We conduct extensive experiments to collect data in a variety of bottles and environmental settings. The results show that the accuracy of fluid type detection ranges from 74.93% to 94.98% while trying to detect the fluid of an unseen bottle. Our results for volume estimation show that the regression-based volume estimation supports a root-relative-squared-error that ranges from 1.12% to 13.36%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9432862/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"15 Sept.15, 2021",ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These scenarios call for more advanced performance in application-specific algorithms and efficient hardware support. Warnings on health emergencies sensitive to response speed require low latency output and action early detection capabilities. Medical monitoring that works in an always-on edge platform needs the system processor to have extreme energy efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MC-LSTM, a functional and versatile 3D skeleton-based action detection system, for the above demands. Our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on trimmed and untrimmed cases of general-purpose and medical-specific datasets with early-detection features.

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427992/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on a real medical insurance data set.

These applications include physical health tracking, surveillance systems, and robotic assistive technologies. Despite the wide range of applications, classification and recognition of human activities remains imprecise and this may contribute to unfavorable reactions and responses. To improve the recognition of human activities, we designed a dataset in which ten participants (five male and five female) performed 11 different activities wearing three body-worn inertial sensors in different locations on the body. Our model extracts data via a hierarchical feature-based technique. These features include time, wavelet, and time-frequency domains, respectively.

This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical Fz 0.97, anterior Fy 0.96 (both running), and lateral Fx 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). Conclusion: These best-case correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing. The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned in this study.

The number of identified samples is largely different for each emotion, which results in an imbalanced dataset problem. This research proposes the dimensional model of emotions as a perceptual representation space alternative to the generally used acoustic one. The main contribution of the paper is the definition of a perceptual borderline for the oversampling of minority emotion classes in this space.

10.1109/TASE.2020.3041427,Physiological Tremor Filtering Without Phase Distortion for Robotic Microsurgery,IEEE,Journals,"All existing physiological tremor filtering algorithms, developed for robotic microsurgery, use nonlinear phase prefilters to isolate the tremor signal. Such filters cause phase distortion to the filtered tremor signal and limit the filtering accuracy. We revisited this long-standing problem to enable filtering of the physiological tremor without any phase distortion. We developed a combined estimation–prediction paradigm that offers zero-phase type filtering. The estimation is achieved with the mathematically modified recursive singular spectrum analysis algorithm, and the prediction is delivered with the standard extreme learning machine. In addition, to limit the computational cost, we developed two moving window versions of this structure, which are appropriate for real-time implementation. The proposed paradigm preserved the natural phase of the filtered tremor. It achieved the key performance index of error limitation below  $10\mu \text{m}$ , yielding the estimation accuracy larger than 70%, at a time delay of 36 ms only. Both moving window versions of the proposed approach restricted the computational cost considerably while offering the same performance. It is the first time that the effective estimation of the physiological tremor is achieved, without any prefiltering and phase distortion. This proposed method is feasible for real-time implantation. Clinical translation of the proposed paradigm can significantly enhance the outcome in hand-held surgical robotics. Note to Practitioners—The imprecision caused by physiological hand tremor in microsurgeries has motivated researchers to innovate an efficient tremor compensating technique that can improve surgical performance. Yet, all the existing tremor filtering algorithms, implemented in hand-held surgical instruments, use nonlinear phase prefilters to separate the tremor signal. The inherent phase distortion caused by such prefilters restricts the filtering performance significantly and renders the existing methods inadequate for hand-held robotic surgery. Motivated by this, we proposed a novel estimator-predictor-based framework, by adopting the modified recursive singular spectrum analysis estimator and the extreme learning machine predictor. The proposed framework filters the tremor signal accurately, without distorting it, but at a small fixed lag. In a set of rigorous testing performed by emulating real-time processing, the proposed algorithm showed higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. This validates not only its suitability for real-time implantation but also its potential to improve surgical performance, which has been limited by the distorted filtering. Nonetheless, we have presented a proof-of-principle framework for distortion-free filtering, but its full implementation in a real surgical instrument, such as Micron or ITrem, requires a substantial amount of experimental testing and verification. It can be also applicable in a wide range of areas, including health-care, digital manufacturing, smart automation and control, and various other robotic technologies where efficient filtering of advanced sensor data is highly desirable.

By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks. We demonstrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of <i>Citrus</i>: a novel intrusion detection framework which is adept at tackling emerging threats through the collection and labelling of live attack data by utilising diverse Internet vantage points in order to detect and classify malicious behaviour using graph-based metrics as well as a range of machine learning (ML) algorithms.

In the aging society, the elder people generally call for specialized healthcare services that are often provisioned by their residential areas or houses or communities. In this situation, recommending appropriate houses or real estates to the elder people becomes a necessity to help create a healthy elderly care service community, which contribute much to the stability and health of the whole nation even all the world. However, the personalized preferences of the elder people are often hard to capture and profile as the requirements from the elder people are generally vague and undetermined. Moreover, the profiles of the elder people stored in different cloud platforms are often sensitive enough, which block the rational and full use of the valuable elder people profiles for better elder people preference prediction. Considering the above two challenging issues, in this research work, we propose a privacy-aware real estate recommendation method for elderly care based on the historical consumption behaviors of the elder people stored in cloud platforms.

Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide $24\times 7$ health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services. However, the open and insecure nature of the internet poses a number of security threats to patient secrecy and privacy. Security design for TMIS is not trivial. Essential security and privacy are provided by mutual authentication and key agreement protocols. This paper proposes an efficient and secure, bilinear pairing-based, unlink-able, mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for TMIS. The proposed protocol adopts a fuzzy extractor for the identification of patients using the biometric data.

This necessitates the use of a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) while providing disease detection services, such as decision tree-based disease detection. However, the existing homomorphic encryption schemes utilized in decision tree-based disease detection that ensure the privacy of the medical user and health cloud are computationally-intensive and energy-hungry at the edge devices. Hence the medical user finds it difficult to exploit the existing private decision tree-based disease detection services due to restrictions on battery capacity and computing resources. Therefore, this work proposes a protocol for private decision tree classification with low resource consumption (PDTC-LRC) on edge devices of medical users by considering decision tree parameters as confidential to the health cloud. An energy-efficient, additively homomorphic, symmetric key-based FHE-compatible Rivest scheme (FCRS) is developed for implementing PDTC-LRC. FCRS can be decrypted homomorphically at the health cloud to support additive and multiplicative homomorphism. Also, an energy and bandwidth-efficient secure integer comparison protocol is developed for realizing PDTC-LRC. Experiments on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ board validate the improved energy efficiency and real-time applicability of the proposed secure integer comparison protocol and decision tree classifier compared with similar schemes available in the literature.

However, the high degree of freedom of the wrist movements during daily-life situations imposes serious challenges for a precise and robust automatic detection. In this study, we deal with such challenges and propose an accurate algorithm to detect GB using a wrist-mounted accelerometer.

RUL estimation can be done by using two main approaches, namely model-based and data-driven approaches. The first approach is based on the utilization of physics of failure models of the degradation, while the second approach is based on the transformation of the data provided by the sensors into models that represent the behavior of the degradation. This paper deals with a data-driven prognostics method, where the RUL of the physical system is assessed depending on its critical component. Once the critical component is identified, and the appropriate sensors installed, the data provided by these sensors are exploited to model the degradation's behavior. For this purpose, Mixture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Models (MoG-HMMs), represented by Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), are used as a modeling tool. MoG-HMMs allow us to represent the evolution of the component's health condition by hidden states by using temporal or frequency features extracted from the raw signals provided by the sensors. The prognostics process is then done in two phases: a learning phase to generate the behavior model, and an exploitation phase to estimate the current health state and calculate the RUL. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is verified by implementing prognostics performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and prediction horizon. Finally, the proposed method is applied to real data corresponding to the accelerated life of bearings, and experimental results are discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6190764/,IEEE Transactions on Reliability,June 2012,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN).

Therefore, we propose an intelligent scoring algorithm that limits the number of user annotation requests through the confidence of predictions generated by the tracking algorithm and automatically annotating data with high confidence. We enhance our scoring algorithm by providing improvements in our tracking algorithm by obtaining context data from nearable sensors. Each specific context of a user bounds the set of activities that can likely occur, which in turn improves the tracking algorithm and confidence.

10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621477,A Deep Predictive Model in Healthcare for Inpatients,IEEE,Conferences,"With the exponential growth of clinical data which are longitudinal, sparse and heterogeneous, deep learning methods are receiving increasingly attention for predictive tasks in healthcare. These methods have strong abilities to extract low-dimensional representations for prediction from patient's historical information without human intervention. However, most of existing deep learning approaches focus on predictive tasks of outpatients, such as disease progression, readmission risk and so on. Considering the differences about data characteristics and prediction goals between outpatients and inpatients, these outpatient-oriented methods are not suitable for inpatients. In this study, we propose an end-to-end predictive model for inpatients called DPMI to address the challenges about fixed diagnosis and time irregularity. DPMI is a modified Long-Short Term Memory network with three kinds of representations and an attention mechanism. For an inpatient visit that consist of several days, the guidance role of diagnosis for the days and the temporal relation among the days are utilized by DPMI to learn the representation of the visit. Our experiments on large real-world data demonstrate that DPMI achieves significant improvement in prediction accuracy of two typical inpatient predictive tasks, and the prediction outputs are easy to interpret.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621477/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),3-6 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1].

Today, commercial devices, which implement simplified BAN monitoring have appeared, although they usually imply expensive subscription costs or need for a supporting device carried by the user (e.g. a smart phone) which, in case of elderly people, cannot be easily held. However, the integration between commercial devices and external sensors located on/in the body is still an open issue due to the limited processing capabilities of low cost commercial devices. Also, no tools for anomaly detection aimed at reliable healthcare monitoring are currently commercially available. In this paper, we focus on Cloud-Assisted BANs and evolve this vision according to the emerging paradigm of edge computing. We present design, implementation and experimentation of a wireless BAN system which performs data transmission using a commercial, cheap, off-the-shelf gateway smart watch. A mechanism for prompt anomaly detection at the edge node is also supported for the purpose of reliable healthcare monitoring as well as pre-filtering of the data at the smart device itself. Also, in order to reduce the overhead caused by propagation of useless and time-correlated data, and to guarantee a prompt action in case of emergency, edge network nodes located closer to the patient BAN are exploited since they can execute machine learning algorithms to process large amounts of data and activate potential alerts in a shorter time and without overloading the cloud.

In this study of face detection, a facial expression recognition system was developed which can be useful for robots of rehabilitation nursing beds. This article mainly researches two aspects: face image feature extraction and classifier design. Since many low-resolution face images are often encountered in actual environments (such as surveillance), if you use traditional methods to directly extract image features, the results are often not satisfactory. For the influence of face recognition results, this paper proposes a feature fusion extraction method based on KNN with LDA(Fisherfaces) and PCA (eigenfaces). First, the original image (low resolution) is decomposed into three different resolution images, and then the three images are used as the basis for the position to extract facial features, then LDA and PCA are used to perform preliminary analysis to obtain reduced dimensional reduction features.

We validate the proposed model by implementing a genetic algorithm that captures important features of a real-world patient time-series data (original) and in applying constraints in the generative process, outputs a best fit synthetic candidate solution of the original time series data. Experimental results using statistical verification tests on both the synthetic and original datasets showed that the synthetic dataset preserved features from the original dataset. We used machine learning prediction models that integrated the synthetic dataset into classification learners and compare their outcomes with those from learners trained with the original dataset. We found promising results in machine learner's ability to discriminate between the different classes when synthetic data is used for training.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8419364/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI),4-7 June 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TASE.2020.3029028,Clustered Discriminant Regression for High-Dimensional Data Feature Extraction and Its Applications in Healthcare and Additive Manufacturing,IEEE,Journals,"The recent increase in applications of high-dimensional data poses a severe challenge to data analytics, such as supervised classification, particularly for online applications. To tackle this challenge, efficient and effective methods for feature extraction are critical to the performance of classification analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a new supervised feature extraction method for high-dimensional data. It is achieved by developing a clustered discriminant regression (CDR) to extract informative and discriminant features for high-dimensional data. In CDR, the variables are clustered into different groups or subspaces, within which feature extraction is performed separately. The CDR algorithm, which is a greedy approach, is implemented to obtain the solution toward optimal feature extraction. One numerical study is performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for variable selection. Three case studies using healthcare and additive manufacturing data sets are accomplished to demonstrate the classification performance of the proposed methods for real-world applications. The results clearly show that the proposed method is superior over the existing method for high-dimensional data feature extraction. Note to Practitioners—This article forwards a new supervised feature extraction method termed clustered discriminant regression. This method is highly effective for classification analysis of high-dimensional data, such as images or videos, where the number of variables is much larger than the number of samples. In our case studies on healthcare and additive manufacturing, the performance of classification analysis based on our method is superior over the existing feature extraction methods, which is confirmed by using various popular classification algorithms. For image classification, our method with elaborately selected classification algorithms can outperform a convolutional neural network. In addition, the computation efficiency of the proposed method is also promising, which enables its online applications, such as advanced manufacturing process monitoring and control.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9237105/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This framework uses smart sensors for communications and deep learning for intelligent decision-making within the smart city perspective. The cognitive and smart framework monitors patients' state in real time and provides accurate, timely, and high-quality healthcare services at low cost. To assess the feasibility of the proposed framework, we present the experimental results of an EEG pathology classification technique that uses deep learning. We employ a range of healthcare smart sensors, including an EEG smart sensor, to record and monitor multimodal healthcare data continuously. The EEG signals from patients are transmitted via smart IoT devices to the cloud, where they are processed and sent to a cognitive module. The system determines the state of the patient by monitoring sensor readings, such as facial expressions, speech, EEG, movements, and gestures. The real-time decision, based on which the future course of action is taken, is made by the cognitive module. When information is transmitted to the deep learning module, the EEG signals are classified as pathologic or normal.

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141913,Decentralized Federated Learning for Healthcare Networks: A Case Study on Tumor Segmentation,IEEE,Journals,"Smart healthcare relies on artificial intelligence (AI) functions for learning and analysis of patient data. Since large and diverse datasets for training of Machine Learning (ML) models can rarely be found in individual medical centers, classical centralized AI requires moving privacy-sensitive data from medical institutions to data centers that process the fused information. Training on data centers thus requires higher communication resource/energy demands while violating privacy. This is considered today as a significant bottleneck in pursuing scientific collaboration across trans-national clinical medical research centers. Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed AI approach that enables the cooperative training of ML models, without the need of sharing patient data. This paper dives into the analysis of different FL methods and proposes a real-time distributed networking framework based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In particular, we design a number of solutions for ML over networks, based on FL tools relying on a parameter server (PS) and fully decentralized paradigms driven by consensus methods. The proposed approach is validated in the context of brain tumor segmentation, using a modified version of the popular U-NET model with representative clinical datasets obtained from the daily clinical workflow. The FL process is implemented on multiple physically separated machines located in different countries and communicating over the Internet.

A semisupervised deep learning framework is designed and built for more accurate HAR, which efficiently uses and analyzes the weakly labeled sensor data to train the classifier learning model. To better solve the problem of the inadequately labeled sample, an intelligent autolabeling scheme based on deep Q-network (DQN) is developed with a newly designed distance-based reward rule which can improve the learning efficiency in IoT environments. A multisensor based data fusion mechanism is then developed to seamlessly integrate the on-body sensor data, context sensor data, and personal profile data together, and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based classification method is proposed to identify fine-grained patterns according to the high-level features contextually extracted from the sequential motion data.

In this study we investigated the feasibility of generating real-time 3D (i.e., 4D) SHI volumes. Four-dimensional SHI (f0 = 5.8 MHz, transmitting 4 cycle pulses) was implemented on a Logiq 9 ultrasound scanner with a mechanically controlled 4D10L probe (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Experimental software provided access to both individual slice data and rendered images. This software also allowed imaging in B-mode (at 10 MHz) and harmonic imaging (HI; f0 = 5 MHz, freceive= 10 MHz). Two canines received 5 µl/kg bolus injections of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA) for HI and 20 µl/kg bolus for SHI of the lower renal pole. The contrast-to-tissue ratio was then calculated for three injections in each canine and compared between modes. Patients scheduled for biopsy of a mammographically identified breast lesion provided informed consent. Baseline scanning was performed in both B-mode and power Doppler. Patients then received a 0.25 ml bolus of Definity for HI followed by a bolus injection of 20 µl/kg for SHI. Baseline 2D cine loops, 3D slice data and rendered volumes were saved for off-line comparison. While scan volumes varied, a volume of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm acquired at a 19° volume angle resulted in 45–50 slices per volume at an acquisition rate of 1.8 to 2.2 Hz depending on depth. In the canine model, SHI resulted in significant improvement in contrast visualization and rendered SHI images demonstrated superior tissue suppression and a greater overall view of renal vasculature. In breast lesions, enhancement varied greatly on a case by case basis. However, SHI resulted in improved tissue suppression and detection of contrast in almost all cases.

Traditionally, MIL is used in the supervised-learning setting and is able to classify bags which can contain any number of instances. This property allows MIL to be naturally applied to solve the problems in a wide variety of real-world applications from computer vision to healthcare. However, many traditional MIL algorithms do not scale efficiently to large datasets. In this paper we present a novel Primal-Dual Multi-Instance Support Vector Machine (pdMISVM) derivation and implementation that can operate efficiently on large scale data. Our method relies on an algorithm derived using a multi-block variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The approach presented in this work is able to scale to large-scale data since it avoids iteratively solving quadratic programming problems which are generally used to optimize MIL algorithms based on SVMs. In addition, we modify our derivation to include an additional optimization designed to avoid solving a least-squares problem during our algorithm; this optimization increases the utility of our approach to handle a large number of features as well as bags. Finally, we apply our approach to synthetic and real-world multi-instance datasets to illustrate the scalability, promising predictive performance, and interpretability of our proposed method.

An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation.

With the increase in patient population, remotely prioritizing and diagnosing patients becomes a major problem. Research has been conducted to address this issue. However, many models fail to support the condition of comorbidity. In this paper, we developed a multi-task machine learning model that supports remote patient prioritization based on disease severity. This model not only considers patients diagnosed with a single disease, but also acknowledges comorbidity of a patient to calculate their severity utilizing physiological data. Classifying a comorbid patient based on their disease(s) severity is a challenging task. We achieve this by exploiting the commonalities and differences between the diseases using multi-task machine learning. Based on the correlation between diseases, we classify the patient into appropriate severity level.

While these models achieve increasingly better predictive performance, their structures have also become much more complex. A common and difficult problem for complex models is overfitting. Regularization is used to penalize the complexity of the model in order to avoid overfitting. However, in most learning frameworks, regularization function is usually set as some hyper parameters, and therefore the best setting is difficult to find. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regularization method, as part of a large end-to-end healthcare data analytics software stack, which effectively addresses the above difficulty. First, we propose a general adaptive regularization method based on Gaussian Mixture (GM) to learn the best regularization function according to the observed parameters. Second, we develop an effective update algorithm which integrates Expectation Maximization (EM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Third, we design a lazy update algorithm to reduce the computational cost by 4x. The overall regularization framework is fast, adaptive and easy-to-use.

However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of model transparency and bias against some medical conditions or patients&#x2019; sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a low consistency: &#x2248; 33% on average. On the contrary, kernel methods are robust against any orthogonal changes, with explanation consistency at 94%.

Real-time and accurate objective pain assessment help hospital staffs and caregivers decide the proper dosage of pain medication to be provided to a patient in a timely manner. The state-of-the-art automatic and objective pain assessment techniques in the literature can be classified into two main categories: physiological-based and behavioral-based. The first-class monitors the changes in patients' physiological data such as Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Photoplethysmography (PPG) to identify autonomic nervous system reactions to pain, while the second class utilizes behavioral reactions to pain such as techniques using computer vision-based techniques by extracting features from patients' head poses and facial expressions. Recent pain monitoring systems have become multi-modal meaning that they deploy a combination of both approaches to improve pain monitoring accuracy. Although such complex models are highly accurate in pain monitoring, they are more computationally intensive imposing feasibility limitations to implement them on wearable devices in terms of energy efficiency (battery life) as well as computation latency. A smart and self-aware system capable of adaptively making a decision at run-time in response to the changes in pain level and context can minimize energy consumption by dynamically offloading tasks to the gateway devices at the edge layer. For this reason, in this paper, a self-aware system is proposed for the continuous assessment of pain intensity at the edge layer.

For the vision to be a reality, the use of context-awareness as a technique for the development of pervasive computing applications is of growing interest. Context-awareness gives flexibility, adaptability, and autonomy to the computing system. In this paper, design and development of a MATLAB-based instant messaging tool with automatic emoji insertion is presented. This tool incorporates a two-way application that uses ThingSpeak as a middleware. It also takes inputs from different sensors that indicate a specific context on which a decision is made about the type of emoji to be inserted into the text message. The contexts that are taken into consideration are physical, human, and local and networked ICT environments. In addition, the system demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence for emotion detection as well as physical environment tagging. After implementation, we analyzed its accuracy, response time, and major constraints that need to be taken into consideration. Most of the contexts were detected with high accuracy between 86.6667% and 100%, in addition to faster response times between 565.28ms and 1.743s when tested individually. However, in a scenario where all contexts are being used in a prioritized way, the performance of the overall system was affected by the 66.67% medium accuracy of the emotion detection system(intelligent feature) and its slow response times of 5.979s.

However, even though existing studies have already shown the advantages of emotion recognition with multi-source data such as text, audio and video, the current research and practice in HCSE are primarily based on single-source data. In addition, emotion recognition in HCSE faces several challenges such as multiple participants, changing environments and real-time requirement. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Edge4Emotion, a novel edge computing-based multisource human emotion recognition platform for HCSE. Edge4Emotion takes the advantage of the edge computing paradigm to efficiently support the collection of multi-source data such as audio, video and physiological data from various IoT devices, and emotion recognition with both single- and multisource models. As an on-going project, this paper focuses on the platform design and the preliminary evaluation of the platform with representative emotion recognition applications. The platform will be further extended to include more multi-source learning models and serve as an open-source platform for the development and evaluation of multi-source emotion recognition models for HCSE.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499694/,"2021 IEEE/ACM 21st International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)",10-13 May 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recently, the AAL IoT ecosystem has been enriched with promising technologies such as edge computing, which has demonstrated to be the best approach to overcome the demanding requirements of AAL and healthcare services by providing a reduction of the amount of data to transfer to the cloud, an improvement of the response time, and quality of experience. Also, the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies at the edge provides intelligence to improve the decision making timely. However, this approach has been scarcely studied in AAL scenarios and the few proposals based on deploying machine learning models at the edge lack efficiency, security, mechanisms of resource management, service management, and deployment, as well as a real and experimental AAL scenario. For these reasons, this paper proposes an innovative edge gateway architecture to support the deployment of deep learning (DL) models in AAL and healthcare scenarios efficiently. To do so, we have added a predictive analytics module to deploy the models. Since AI technologies demand more resources, a container-based virtualization technology is employed on the edge gateway to manage the limited resources, and provide security and lifecycle services management. The edge gateway performance was evaluated deploying a DL-based fall detection application on it. As a result, our approach improves the inference time compared to that based on the cloud in 34 seconds and to similar approaches in 8 seconds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8767231/,2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT),15-18 April 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of IoMT is to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of medical operations, i.e., remotely monitoring the status of patients. In such healthcare environments, smartphones have become an important device to communicate with others and update the information of patients, resulting in a special type of IoMT called Medical Smartphone Networks (MSNs). To reinforce the distributed architecture, trust management schemes are often implemented to defend against insider attacks. However, how to maintain the robustness of trust management in heavy traffic networks still remains a challenge, i.e., COVID-19 incident would cause excessive traffic for healthcare organizations and increase the difficulty of validating trustworthiness among MSN nodes. In this work, we focus on this issue and propose a blockchain-enabled adaptive traffic sampling method to help enhance the robustness of trust management under high traffic environments.

Although there are many ontologies defined, their adoption in real-world applications is limited, because their quality is unknown. The quality of the ontology directly determines its use and reuse in real-world applications, which is especially important for the medical domain. To assure its quality, an ontology should be evaluated with a set of comprehensive and systematic metrics and approaches. In this work, we studied the ontology evaluation problem in the medical domain. Specifically, we present the evaluation framework to evaluate, NAOnto, an ontology we developed for personalized diabetes management of Native Americans. The framework consists of two important parts of the evaluation, namely verification, and validation. We adopt software quality standard metrics to verify ontology as a software application while applying the ontology to real applications to validate its contained knowledge.

In VR environments, users can navigate 360-degree content by moving or looking around in all directions, by rotating their heads, as in real life. A rapid head rotation can corrupt the wireless link, degrading the user experience. Due to the lack of proper head rotation models, testbeds are usually required to analyze VR systems. In this paper, we propose an open source code package that generates realistic head rotation traces. The code package is based on a simple, yet flexible, time-correlated mathematical model, which is extrapolated from a publicly available VR head rotation measurement-based dataset. We show that the probability density function of head rotation pitch and roll angles can be modeled as Gaussian distributions, while the probability density function of yaw angles can be modeled as a Gaussian mixture distribution. To introduce temporal correlation, we extrapolate the power spectral density of the angular processes, which are modeled with a bi-exponential decay. Finally, we show how the model can support and accelerate the design of future VR systems by proposing the analysis of a distributed Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and the design of a situational awareness Machine Learning (ML) based beamforming training for millimeter wave networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9666091/,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM),29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A HAR system is essentially made of a wearable device equipped with a set of sensors (like accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, heart-rate sensors, etc...) and a classifier able to recognize the activity performed. In this study we focused on the choice of the classifier, since there isn't a unique and consolidated methodology for HAR. The main aim of the study is to compare the performances of 5 classifiers, based on machine learning. Furthermore, we analyzed advantages and disadvantages of their implementation onto a wearable and realtime HAR system. We acquired magnetic and inertial measurement unit (MIMU) signals from 15 young volunteers. For each subject, we recorded 9 signals from tri-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. All signals were divided in 5s-windows and processed to extract 342 features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains. By means of two feature selection steps (correlation-based and genetic algorithm), we reduced the number of features to 69. These features were used as input for the following 5 classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT). Our results showed that all classifiers were able to correctly recognize more than 90% of activities. The best performances were obtained by KNN. Analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each classifier for its implementation by means of a microcontroller the most suitable was DT.

Real life applications in healthcare sectors, home automation, industry, smart cities, monitoring scenarios, etc. benefit from the low-cost wireless technology in IoT on one hand. On the contrary, IoT system has many challenging features: many devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory, are highly heterogeneous and their applications continuously transmit transient information.

Deep learning has been extensively utilized in various IoT applications which require huge amount of data for model training. Due to privacy requirements, smart IoT devices do not release data to a remote third party for their use. To overcome this problem, collaborative approach to deep learning, also known as Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL) has been largely employed in data-driven applications. This approach enables multiple edge IoT devices to train their models locally on mobile edge devices. In this paper, we address IoT device training problem in CDL by analyzing the behavior of mobile edge devices using a game-theoretic model, where each mobile edge device aims at maximizing the accuracy of its local model at the same time limiting the overhead of participating in CDL.

In big data systems, machine learning plays an important role due to its effectiveness in discovering hidden information and valuable knowledge. Data privacy, however, becomes an unavoidable concern since big data usually involve multiple organizations, e.g., different healthcare systems and hospitals, who are not in the same trust domain and may be reluctant to share their data publicly. Applying traditional cryptographic tools is a straightforward approach to protect sensitive information, but it often renders learning algorithms useless inevitably. In this work, we, for the first time, propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme for canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which is a well-known learning technique and has been widely used in cross-media retrieval system. We first develop a library of building blocks to support various arithmetics over encrypted real numbers by leveraging additively homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits. Then we encrypt private data by randomly splitting the numerical data, formalize CCA problem and reduce it to a symmetric eigenvalue problem by designing new protocols for privacy-preserving QR decomposition. Finally, we solve all the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors by running Newton-Raphson method and inverse power method over the ciphertext domain. We carefully analyze the security and extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our design.

Combined with deep learning, these applications have achieved significant success in recent years. Different from conventional cloud-based paradigms, running deep learning on devices offers several advantages including data privacy preservation and low-latency response for both model inference and update. Since data collection is costly in reality, Google’s Federated Learning offers not only complete data privacy but also better model robustness based on multiple user data. However, personal mobile sensing applications are mostly user-specific and highly affected by environment. As a result, continuous local changes may seriously affect the performance of a global model generated by Federated Learning. In addition, deploying Federated Learning on a local server, e.g., edge server, may quickly reach the bottleneck due to resource constraint and serious failure by attacks. Towards pushing deep learning on devices, we present MDLdroid, a novel decentralized mobile deep learning framework to enable resource-aware on-device collaborative learning for personal mobile sensing applications.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning has been used successfully to detect anomalous beats in ECG. However, the computational complexity of existing CNN models prohibits them from being implemented in low-powered edge devices. Usually, such models are complex with lots of model parameters which results in large number of computations, memory, and power usage in edge devices. Network pruning techniques can reduce model complexity at the expense of performance in CNN models. This paper presents a novel multistage pruning technique that reduces CNN model complexity with negligible loss in performance compared to existing pruning techniques. An existing CNN model for ECG classification is used as a baseline reference. At 60% sparsity, the proposed technique achieves 97.7% accuracy and an F1 score of 93.59% for ECG classification tasks. This is an improvement of 3.3% and 9% for accuracy and F1 Score respectively, compared to traditional pruning with fine-tuning approach.

In vitro, ambient pressures were varied (between 0 and 120 mmHg) in a closed-loop flow system circulating 0.2 ml Sonazoid microbubbles (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) suspended in 750 ml of isotonic diluent and recorded by a Millar pressure catheter as the reference standard. Simultaneously, a SonixRP ultrasound scanner (Ultrasonix Medical Corp., Richmond, BC, Canada) operating in pulse inversion mode (ftransmit: 2.5 MHz) was used to acquire unprocessed RF data at five different incident acoustic pressures (from 76 kPa to 897 kPa; n=3). The subharmonic data for each pulse was extracted using band-pass filtering with averaging, and subsequently, processed to eliminate noise. The incident acoustic pressure most sensitive to ambient pressure fluctuations was determined; then the ambient pressure was tracked over 20 seconds. Regression analysis compared subharmonic and catheter pressure values. In vivo validation of this technique was performed noninvasively for tracking left ventricular (LV) pressures of two canines using similar post processing as in vitro. The subharmonic signal tracked ambient pressures with r2 = 0.922 for 20 seconds in vitro. In vivo the subharmonic signal tracked the LV pressures with r2 >; 0.7P90.

Most of these insulin pump systems have limited security mechanisms embedded to protect them from malicious attacks. In this paper, two attacks against insulin pump systems via wireless links are investigated: a single acute overdose with a significant amount of medication, and chronic overdose with an insignificant amount of extra medication over a long time period, e.g., several months. These attacks can be launched unobtrusively and may jeopardize patients' lives. It is very important and urgent to protect patients from these attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel patient infusion pattern based access control scheme (PIPAC) for wireless insulin pumps. This scheme employs a supervised learning approach to learn normal patient infusions pattern with the dosage amount, rate, and time of infusion, which are automatically recorded in insulin pump logs. The generated regression models are used to dynamically configure a safety infusion range for abnormal infusion identification. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with real insulin pump logs used by several patients for up to 6 months.

Many countries propose their national clinical pathways to improve the quality of care, reduce variation in clinical practice, and increase the efficient use of healthcare resources. Nevertheless, clinical pathways are typically not prescriptive, and the patient’s care journey is an individual one, therefore how to handle the variances of clinical pathways is an important issue. Previous methods construct clinical pathway recommendation models either using national standard clinical pathways to obtain the guidance, or using real-world clinical datasets to obtain clinical experience. However, few research tries to use both of them. This will result in existing algorithms that cannot accurately recommend personalized clinical pathway. To overcome the above problems, we propose P ersonalized C linical P athway Rec ommendation(PCPRec). On the one hand, to obtain general clinical pathway recommendations, we built a novel module to pre-train the self-attention model based on the national standard clinical pathway.

By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients. This research proposes an alert system that could send immediate information to the medical consultants once detects serious condition from the collected data of the patient. Furthermore, the system is able to track various types of symptoms through mobile application in the purpose of obtaining support from medical specialists when it is required. A machine-learning algorithm was conducted to perform the classification process. Four experiments were carried out to classify sickle cell disease patients from normal patients using machine-learning algorithm in which 99.5984% classification accuracy was achieved using Multi-layer perceptron.

Measurable emotion recognition from the speech signal by employing microphone is an emerging and interesting area of research in HCI such as human reboot interaction, healthcare, virtual reality, emergency call, and behavior assessment. In this paper, we proposed a novel integration of spectral features comprises of mel-spectral frequency coefficients (MFCC), root mean square energy (RMSE), and zero crossing rate (ZCR) to represent complex audio signal.

Healthcare service to the patient is one of the real world problems where travelling path has significant impact on the service time. The purpose of this research is to develop new approach to solve multiple travelling salesman problem (MTSP) for healthcare staff members offering healthcare services at patients homes travelling in different routes with the minimum total cost.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

Severe constraints on battery capacity and computing resources at the edge devices of MHN impose restrictions in deploying strong secure systems. Medical data need to be stored, communicated, and processed securely in real-time. Homomorphic encryption help to perform linear operations securely on the encrypted data. More complicated operations like ML-based disease diagnosis require nonlinear operations such as integer comparison. Hence a secure multiparty computation over homomorphically encrypted data is required for secure integer comparison. However, comparison protocols available in the literature use energy-hungry public-key cryptosystems. This article presents the design of an energy-efficient additively homomorphic modified Rivest scheme (AHMRS) to support secure integer comparison protocol (SICP-AHMRS), which facilitates fast and energy-efficient ML-based disease diagnosis.

The key enabler to these applications is sensor-based human activity recognition; that is, recognising and analysing human daily activities from wearable and ambient sensors. With the power of machine learning we can recognise complex correlations between various types of sensor data and the activities being observed. However the challenges still remain: (1) they often rely on a large amount of labelled training data to build the model, and (2) they cannot dynamically adapt the model with emerging or changing activity patterns over time. To directly address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model, i.e. Dirichlet process mixture of conditionally independent von Mises Fisher models, to enable both unsupervised and semi-supervised dynamic learning of human activities. The Bayesian nonparametric model can dynamically adapt itself to the evolving activity patterns without human intervention and the learning results can be used to alleviate the annotation effort.

The challenges and complexity involved in developing a video-based human action recognition system are manifold. In particular, recognizing actions with similar gestures and describing complex actions is a very challenging problem. To address these issues, we study the problem of classifying human actions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and develop a hierarchical 3DCNN architecture for similar gesture recognition. The proposed model firstly combines similar gesture pairs into one class, and classify them along with all other class, as a stage-1 classification. In stage-2, similar gesture pairs are classified individually, which reduces the problem to binary classification.

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device.

Unsurprisingly, the cybersecurity of MCPS is of high concern, as they are life-critical systems that, if compromised, may result in dire consequences to the patient. A variety of security requirements have been developed over the past 10 years as a result of governmental acts such as HITECH in order to better secure and protect healthcare environments. However, it is unclear how applicable these re-quirements may be to MCPS infrastructures. As a result, this case study analyzes current healthcare security requirements and their applicability to MCPS using an approach that leverages ontological representations and automated requirement traversal techniques. Using such a methodology, we find that 70% of applicable requirements/risks for MCPS components are missing from the security documentation, including serious items such as Authentication, Data Encryption, DoS attacks, and Legacy Vulnerabilities.

This opens up exciting new possibilities for applications in various domains including: education, training, healthcare, and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Recognizing physical objects in the environment provides contextual clues that can improve user task performance and influence effective cognitive load for complex tasks. However, this facet of MR is still relatively nascent because of hardware limitations. Presently, MR headsets can only detect physical surfaces; they can not distinguish between physical artifacts that a user might need in their work environment. Machine Learning (ML) based object recognition solutions can help overcome this limitation. However, current commercially available MR devices have insufficient computational capabilities and are unable to support the state-of-the-art ML based object recognition solutions. To address these challenges, we describe a novel approach and the corresponding framework by introducing a hardware level separation between the two tasks of object recognition and rendering virtual components. Our approach leverages ML based object recognition, MR, and a portable IoT edge computing platform to support contextual awareness. We describe the implementation of this approach and provide a case study. The prototype implementation uses an edge device to process and recognize objects to get information about the user’s physical environment and provides the user with situational awareness through the MR device.

Mobile-based dietary assessment systems that can record real-time images of the meal and analyze it for nutritional content can be very handy and improve the dietary habits and, therefore, result in a healthy life. This paper proposes a novel system to automatically estimate food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food. Our method employs different deep learning models for accurate food identification. In addition to image analysis, attributes and ingredients are estimated by extracting semantically related words from a huge corpus of text, collected over the Internet. We performed experiments with a dataset comprising 100 classes, averaging 1000 images for each class to acquire top 1 classification rate of up to 85%. An extension of a benchmark dataset Food-101 is also created to include sub-continental foods. Results show that our proposed system is equally efficient on the basic Food-101 dataset and its extension for sub-continental foods.

10.1109/TIM.2019.2895931,A Knowledge-Based Approach for Multiagent Collaboration in Smart Home: From Activity Recognition to Guidance Service,IEEE,Journals,"Smart home (SH) as an emerging paradigm for alleviating the overstretched healthcare resources, and enhancing the quality of life has received increasing attention. While the remarkable progress has been made for the development of SH, it still suffers from a number of issues (e.g., device heterogeneity, composite activities recognition, and providing appropriate services). To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-based approach for multiagent (MA) collaboration. Specifically, a layered architecture of SH that combines ontology and MA technologies is designed to automatically acquire semantic knowledge, and support heterogeneity and interoperability services. In such architecture, a generic inference algorithm is presented based on unordered actions and temporal property of activity for inferring both continuous composite activity and personalized service in real time. Then a novel idea is introduced for agent to learn the knowledge of human activity (HA) autonomously and translate into itself knowledge, the purpose of which is to guide agent for performing services in a way that is compatible with HA. The proposed schemes have been implemented in an SH, and evaluated through extensive experiments.

10.1109/TWC.2020.3033822,A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Game-Based Analysis for Incentive Mechanisms in Socially-Aware Mobile Crowdsensing,IEEE,Journals,"The mobile crowdsensing paradigm facilitates a broad range of emerging sensing applications by leveraging ubiquitous mobile users to cooperatively perform certain sensing tasks with their smart devices. As this paradigm involves data collection from users, the issue of designing rewards to incentivize users is fundamentally important to ensure participation in crowdsensing. In this paper, we revisit this issue in the context of socially-aware crowdsensing which integrates crowdsensing into social networks. For example, in healthcare-based crowdsensing services, the fun of tracking daily nutrition information for a certain user can be promoted by comparing her nutritional information with that contributed and shared by her socially-connected friends. To be more general and practical, we study the incentive mechanisms in presence of multiple crowdsensing service providers and multiple users. Understanding the behaviors of users and service providers in socially-aware crowdsensing is of paramount importance for incentive mechanisms. With this focus, we propose a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game approach to model the strategic interactions among service providers and users, where the social influence of users and the strategic interconnections of service providers are jointly and formally integrated into the game modeling. Through backward induction methods, we theoretically prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. We conduct extensive simulations to investigate game equilibrium properties, and the real-world dataset is applied to evaluate and demonstrate the performance effectiveness of the proposed game model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9247464/,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,March 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905875,A Novel Definition of Equivalent Uniform Dose Based on Volume Dose Curve,IEEE,Journals,"With the improvement of mobile device performance, the requirement of equivalent dose description in intensity-modulated radiation therapy is increasing in mobile multimedia for healthcare. The emergence of mobile cloud computing will provide cloud servers and storage for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mobile applications, thus realizing visualized radiotherapy in a real sense. Equivalent uniform dose (EUD) is a biomedical indicator based on the dose measure. In this paper, the dose volume histogram is used to describe the dose distribution of different tissues in target and nontarget regions. The traditional definition of EUD, such as the exponential form and the linear form, has only a few parameters in the model for fast calculation. However, there is no close relationship between this traditional definition and the dose volume histogram. In order to establish the consistency between the EUD and the dose volume histogram, this paper proposes a novel definition of EUD based on the volume dose curve, called VD-EUD. By using a unique organic volume weight curve, it is easy to calculate VD-EUD for different dose distributions. In definition, different weight curves are used to represent the biological effects of different organs. For the target area, we should be more careful about those voxels with a low dose (cold point); thus, the weight curve is monotonically decreasing. While for the nontarget area, the curve is monotonically increasing. Furthermore, we present the curves for parallel, serial, and mixed organs of nontarget areas separately, and we define the weight curve form with only two parameters. Medical doctors can adjust the curve interactively according to different patients and organs. We also propose a fluence map optimization model with the VD-EUD constraint, which means that the proposed EUD constraint will lead to a large feasible solution space. We compare the generalized EUD (gEUD) and the proposed VD-EUD by experiments, which show that the VD-EUD has a closer relationship with the dose volume histogram. If the biological survival probability is equivalent to the VD-EUD, the feasible solution space would be large, and the target areas can be covered. By establishing a personalized organic weight curve, medical doctors can have a unique VD-EUD for each patient. By using the flexible and adjustable EUD definition, we can establish the VD-EUD-based fluence map optimization model, which will lead to a larger solution space than the traditional dose volume constraint-based model. The VD-EUD is a new definition; thus, we need more clinical testing and verification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673563/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on international standards related to interoperability and security for IoT environments. Moreover, we studied international standard organizations that have been developing standards for IoT. In this study, a systematic literature review is conducted, and international standards are analyzed.

10.1109/TPDS.2022.3153682,Accelerating Bayesian Neural Networks via Algorithmic and Hardware Optimizations,IEEE,Journals,"Bayesian neural networks (BayesNNs) have demonstrated their advantages in various safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving or healthcare, due to their ability to capture and represent model uncertainty. However, standard BayesNNs require to be repeatedly run because of Monte Carlo sampling to quantify their uncertainty, which puts a burden on their real-world hardware performance. To address this performance issue, this article systematically exploits the extensive structured sparsity and redundant computation in BayesNNs. Different from the unstructured or structured sparsity in standard convolutional NNs, the structured sparsity of BayesNNs is introduced by Monte Carlo Dropout and its associated sampling required during uncertainty estimation and prediction, which can be exploited through both algorithmic and hardware optimizations. We first classify the observed sparsity patterns into three categories: channel sparsity, layer sparsity and sample sparsity. On the algorithmic side, a framework is proposed to automatically explore these three sparsity categories without sacrificing algorithmic performance. We demonstrated that structured sparsity can be exploited to accelerate CPU designs by up to 49 times, and GPU designs by up to 40 times. On the hardware side, a novel hardware architecture is proposed to accelerate BayesNNs, which achieves a high hardware performance using the runtime adaptable hardware engines and the intelligent skipping support. Upon implementing the proposed hardware design on an FPGA, our experiments demonstrated that the algorithm-optimized BayesNNs can achieve up to 56 times speedup when compared with unoptimized Bayesian nets. Comparing with the optimized GPU implementation, our FPGA design achieved up to 7.6 times speedup and up to 39.3 times higher energy efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720069/,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1 Dec. 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO. Overall experimental results confirm that the MPAMFO is an efficient MLT approach that approved its superiority over other existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9136648/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Over a period of time, they have become very common and are now overstretching the healthcare systems of countries. The major factors of cardiovascular diseases are high blood pressure, family history, stress, age, gender, cholesterol, Body Mass Index (BMI), and unhealthy lifestyle. Based on these factors, researchers have proposed various approaches for early diagnosis. However, the accuracy of proposed techniques and approaches needs certain improvements due to the inherent criticality and life threatening risks of cardiovascular diseases. In this article, a MaLCaDD (Machine Learning based Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis) framework is proposed for the effective prediction of cardiovascular diseases with high precision. Particularly, the framework first deals with the missing values (via mean replacement technique) and data imbalance (via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique - SMOTE). Subsequently, Feature Importance technique is utilized for feature selection. Finally, an ensemble of Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers is proposed for prediction with higher accuracy. The validation of framework is performed through three benchmark datasets (i.e. Framingham, Heart Disease and Cleveland) and the accuracies of 99.1%, 98.0% and 95.5 % are achieved respectively. Finally, the comparative analysis proves that MaLCaDD predictions are more accurate (with reduced set of features) as compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

It can convert the innumerable raw day-to-day medical big data from massive IoT-based medical devices to diagnostic valuable data so that they can be feed to clinical routine. In this article, we propose a novel spatiotemporal two-streams generative adversarial network (SpGAN) as a cross-modality data processing approach to deploy the medical IoT in infarction learning. Our SpGAN remotely converts diagnostic valuable contrast-enhanced images (the “gold standard” for infarction learning, but it requires the injection of contrast agents) directly from raw nonenhanced cine MR images. This converting allows physicians to remotely perform infarction observation and analysis to break through the limitations of time and space by building a cloud computing platform of IoT-based MRI devices. Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance. Real IoT-based remote diagnosis experiments performed on 230 patients demonstrate that SpGAN provides high-quality converted images for infarction learning and promotes the in-depth application and deployment of IoT in the medical field.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9386256/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The task is challenging owing to shortage and ineffectiveness of clinical testing kits. However, the existing problems can be improved by employing computational intelligent techniques on radiological images like CT-Scans (Computed Tomography) of lungs. Extensive research has been reported using deep learning models to diagnose the severity of COVID-19 from CT images. This has undoubtedly minimized the manual involvement in abnormality identification but reported detection accuracy is limited. Methods: The present work proposes an expert model based on deep features and Parameter Free BAT (PF-BAT) optimized Fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (PF-FKNN) classifier to diagnose novel coronavirus. In this proposed model, features are extracted from the fully connected layer of transfer learned MobileNetv2 followed by FKNN training. The hyperparameters of FKNN are fine-tuned using PF-BAT. Results: The experimental results on the benchmark COVID CT scan data reveal that the proposed algorithm attains a validation accuracy of 99.38% which is better than the existing state-of-the-art methods proposed in past.

In addition, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has become one of the most popular frameworks for training machine learning models. Motivated by the huge success of GAN and deep learning on a wide range of fields, this paper explores an effective way to exploit both techniques into the collaborative filtering task for the accurate recommendation. We have noticed that the IRGAN and GraphGAN are pioneering methods that successfully apply GAN to recommender systems. However, we point out an issue regarding the employment of standard matrix factorization (MF) as their basic model, which is linear and unable to capture the non-linear, subtle latent factors underlying user-item interactions. Our proposed recommendation framework, named Collaborative Adversarial Autoencoders (CAAE), significantly extends the conventional IRGAN and GraphGAN as summarized below: 1) we use Autoencoder, which is one of the most successful deep neural networks, as our generator, instead of using the MF model; 2) we employ Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) as our discriminative model; and 3) we incorporate another generator model into our framework that focuses on generating negative items, which are items that a given user may not be interested in. We empirically test our framework using three real-life datasets along with four evaluation metrics. Owing to those extensions, our proposed framework not only produces considerably higher recommendation accuracy than the conventional GAN-based recommenders (i.e., IRGAN and GraphGAN), but also outperforms the other state-of-the-art top-N recommenders (i.e., BPR, PureSVD, and FISM).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8669749/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection. We implemented our algorithms and evaluated the system with a large dataset of real-world subjects, including people with dementia, MCI persons, and cognitively healthy people.

In this paper, an effective medical recommendation system that uses a fast Fourier transformation-coupled machine learning ensemble model is proposed for short-term disease risk prediction to provide chronic heart disease patients with appropriate recommendations about the need to take a medical test or not on the coming day based on analysing their medical data. The input sequence of sliding windows based on the patient's time series data are decomposed by using the fast Fourier transformation in order to extract the frequency information. A bagging-based ensemble model is utilized to predict the patient's condition one day in advance for producing the final recommendation. A combination of three classifiers-artificial neural network, least squares-support vector machine, and naive bayes-are used to construct an ensemble framework. A real-life time series telehealth data collected from chronic heart disease patients are utilized for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the proposed system yields a very good recommendation accuracy and offers an effective way to reduce the risk of incorrect recommendations as well as reduce the workload for heart disease patients in conducting body tests every day.

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to offer defense solutions that increase the robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel defense solution based on a Deep Denoising Sparse Autoencoder (DDSA).

The pre-processing defense block can be associated with any classifier, without any change to their architecture or training procedure. In addition, the proposed method is a universal defense, since it does not require any knowledge about the attack, making it usable against any type of attack.

In this article, a novel method, called differential enhancement (DE), was proposed, which can effectively eliminate the effects of the respiration harmonic interference on HR estimation, including the likely adjacent harmonic interference. The basic idea underlying our proposed method is that the differential operation can significantly enhance the heartbeat components, especially high-order heartbeat harmonics, and it is very useful to locate the true value of HR by combining with the autocorrelation-based periodicity extraction technique. The detailed procedures for performing the DE method were described, which can be simply implemented and have low computational complexity. In addition, a rigorous mathematical analysis was provided for demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm. Experimental results with various scenarios validated the performance of the proposed method, and we investigated the HR variability (HRV) monitoring capability of the DE method with a short sliding window length.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9036103/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since the epidemic continues to take a devastating impact on the society, economy, and healthcare, the real-time detection of COVID-19 is essential for fast and cost-effective diagnosis services. Fortunately, deep learning (DL), as a promising technology, enables the COVID-19 diagnosis services on chest X-ray (CXR) images. The training task of DL model is generally implemented at the centralized cloud. However, due to the geo-distributed data sources and the transmission of large amounts of raw data to the centralized cloud, the transmission latency becomes a bottleneck of the COVID-19 diagnosis model training. In this paper, we propose a <u>Dis</u>tributed <u>COV</u>ID-19 detection model training method on CXR images with edge-cloud collaboration, named DisCOV. Specifically, to improve the training efficiency and guarantee the model accuracy, a distributed lightweight model-based training algorithm is designed with the cooperation of edge computing and cloud computing.

A subset of medical algorithms referring to MCP solving concerns well-known medical problems and their computational algorithmic solutions. These solutions result from computations within mathematical models aiming to enhance healthcare quality via support for diagnosis and treatment automation, especially useful for educational purposes. Currently, there is a plethora of computational algorithms on the web, which pertain to MCPs and provide all computational facilities required to solve a medical problem. An inherent requirement for the successful construction of algorithmic pathways for managing real medical cases is the composition of a sequence of computational algorithms. The aim of this paper is to approach the composition of such pathways via the design of appropriate finite-state machines (FSMs), the use of ontologies, and SWRL semantic rules. The goal of semantic rules is to automatically associate different algorithms that are represented as different states of the FSM in order to result in a successful pathway.

Multi-access edge computing (MEC) extends the cloud computing paradigm and leverages servers near end-users at the network edge to provide a cloud-like environment. The optimum placement of services on edge servers plays a crucial role in the performance of such service-based applications. Dynamic service placement problem addresses the adaptive configuration of application services at edge servers to facilitate end-users and those devices that need to offload computation tasks. While reported approaches in the literature shed light on this problem from a particular perspective, a panoramic study of this problem reveals the research gaps in the big picture. This paper introduces the dynamic service placement problem and outline its relations with other problems such as task scheduling, resource management, and caching at the edge. We also present a systematic literature review of existing dynamic service placement methods for MEC environments from networking, middleware, applications, and evaluation perspectives. In the first step, we review different MEC architectures and their enabling technologies from a networking point of view. We also introduce different cache deployment solutions in network architectures and discuss their design considerations. The second step investigates dynamic service placement methods from a middleware viewpoint. We review different service packaging technologies and discuss their trade-offs. We also survey the methods and identify eight research directions that researchers follow. Our study categorises the research objectives into six main classes, proposing a taxonomy of design objectives for the dynamic service placement problem. We also investigate the reported methods and devise a solutions taxonomy comprising six criteria. In the third step, we concentrate on the application layer and introduce the applications that can take advantage of dynamic service placement. The fourth step investigates evaluation environments used to validate the solutions, including simulators and testbeds.

When annotations are costly or prohibitive, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) regime can be leveraged requiring only unlabeled samples in the target domain. Existing UDA methods are unable to factor in a model’s predictive loss based on predictions in the target domain and, therefore, suboptimally leverage density ratios of only the input covariates in each domain. In this article, we propose a model selection method for leveraging model predictions on a target domain without labels by exploiting the domain invariance of causal structure. We assume or learn a causal graph from the source domain and select models that produce predicted distributions in the target domain that have the highest likelihood of fitting our causal graph. We thoroughly analyze our method under oracle knowledge using synthetic data. We then show on several real-world datasets, including several COVID-19 examples, that our method is able to improve on the state-of-the-art UDA algorithms for model selection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9503312/,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Further, we can distinguish two types of IoMT devices: passive and active. Passive devices measure some parameters of the body and save them in databases.

Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing, Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be applied widely in wireless IoT networks. To reduce the resource consumption in CNN-based applications, Jia et al. [6] propose the CNN-based Resource Optimization APProach which utilizes model compression and computation sharing to optimize inner-model and inter-model respectively, and the comparison results show the superior performance in scalability and the decrease of resource cost. In mobile crowdsensing activities, Gao et al. [4] propose a differential Location Privacy-preserving Mechanism based on Trajectory obfuscation (LPMT) to protect the location privacy of mobile users, which includes three operations: stay points extraction, stay points obfuscation and stay points sampling. In order to mimic the task-free bottom-up visual attention process by predicting salient regions on natural images, Umer et al. [9] propose a Pseudo Knowledge Distillation (PKD) model based on knowledge distillation and pseudo labelling technique, which is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time on-device saliency prediction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9744549/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,Sept. 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Cloud-centric processing approaches for the IoT data suffer from high and unpredictable network latency, which causes poor experience in real-time IoT applications, such as healthcare. To address this issue, in edge computing, the data inference starts from the data source (i.e., the IoT devices). However, the constrained computational capabilities of the IoT device and the power-hungry data transmission demand a tradeoff between onboard processing and computation offloading. Hence, the IoT information inference requires efficient and lightweight techniques that are tailored for this tradeoff and respect the constrained resources on IoT devices, such as wearables. This article presents a hierarchical classification approach that decomposes the problem into three classifiers in two hierarchy layers. In the first layer, a lightweight classifier executes directly on the IoT device and decides whether to offload the computation to the gateway or to perform it onboard. The second layer comprises a lightweight classifier on the IoT device (can only distinguish a subset of classes) and a complex classifier on the gateway (to distinguish the remaining classes). The experimental results (using a real-world data set for human activity recognition and implemented on a wearable IoT device) show higher accuracy (92% on average) than a nonhierarchical classifier (87% on average). The execution time and power measurements on the IoT device show $3\times $ energy saving for the classification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9075280/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Regularization is used to penalize the complexity of the model in order to avoid overfitting. However, in most learning frameworks, regularization function is usually set with some hyper-parameters where the best setting is difficult to find. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regularization method, as part of a large end-to-end healthcare data analytics software stack, which effectively addresses the above difficulty. First, we propose a general adaptive regularization method based on Gaussian Mixture (GM) to learn the best regularization function according to the observed parameters. Second, we develop an effective update algorithm which integrates Expectation Maximization (EM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Third, we design a lazy update and sparse update algorithm to reduce the computational cost by 4x and 20x, respectively. The overall regularization framework is fast, adaptive, and easy-to-use.

This scheme employs supervised learning approaches to learn normal patient infusion patterns in terms of the dosage amount, rate, and time of infusion, which are automatically recorded in insulin pump logs. The generated regression models are used to dynamically configure a safe infusion range for abnormal infusion identification. This model includes two sub models for bolus (one type of insulin) abnormal dosage detection and basal abnormal rate detection. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with real insulin pump. The evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to detect the two attacks with a very high success rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6954561/,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1 Nov. 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TCBB.2018.2827029,Predicting Hospital Readmission via Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning,IEEE,Journals,"With increased use of electronic medical records (EMRs), data mining on medical data has great potential to improve the quality of hospital treatment and increase the survival rate of patients. Early readmission prediction enables early intervention, which is essential to preventing serious or life-threatening events, and act as a substantial contributor to reduce healthcare costs. Existing works on predicting readmission often focus on certain vital signs and diseases by extracting statistical features. They also fail to consider skewness of class labels in medical data and different costs of misclassification errors. In this paper, we recur to the merits of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically learn features from time series of vital sign, and categorical feature embedding to effectively encode feature vectors with heterogeneous clinical features, such as demographics, hospitalization history, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Then, both learnt features via CNN and statistical features via feature embedding are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for prediction. We use a cost-sensitive formulation to train MLP during prediction to tackle the imbalance and skewness challenge. We validate the proposed approach on two real medical datasets from Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and all data is taken from historical EMR databases and reflects the kinds of data that would realistically be available at the clinical prediction system in hospitals. We find that early prediction of readmission is possible and when compared with state-of-the-art existing methods used by hospitals, our methods perform significantly better. For example, using the general hospital wards data for 30-day readmission prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) for the proposed model was 0.70, significantly higher than all the baseline methods. Based on these results, a system is being deployed in hospital settings with the proposed forecasting algorithms to support treatment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338085/,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,1 Nov.-Dec. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/10.846690,Receiver operating characteristic analysis for intelligent medical systems-a new approach for finding confidence intervals,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in medicine and healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology for evaluating such systems. Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems. It is conjectured that, potentially, the method could be extended to determine risks associated with the deployment of intelligent medical systems in clinical practice.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/846690/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,July 2000,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform.

These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting <i>unknown</i> system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2 percent reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9319511/,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,1 April-June 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/TKDE.2007.1042,Sensor-Based Abnormal Human-Activity Detection,IEEE,Journals,"With the availability of affordable sensors and sensor networks, sensor-based human activity recognition has attracted much attention in artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we present a novel two-phase approach for detecting abnormal activities based on wireless sensors attached to a human body. Detecting abnormal activities is a particular important task in security monitoring and healthcare applications of sensor networks, among many others. Traditional approaches to this problem suffer from a high false positive rate, particularly when the collected sensor data are biased towards normal data while the abnormal events are rare. Therefore, there is a lack of training data for many traditional data mining methods to be applied. To solve this problem, our approach first employs a one-class support vector machine (SVM) that is trained on commonly available normal activities, which filters out the activities that have a very high probability of being normal. We then derive abnormal activity models from a general normal model via a kernel nonlinear regression (KNLR) to reduce false positive rate in an unsupervised manner. We show that our approach provides a good tradeoff between abnormality detection rate and false alarm rate, and allows abnormal activity models to be automatically derived without the need to explicitly label the abnormal training data, which are scarce. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real data collected from a sensor network that is deployed in a realistic setting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4358934/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,Aug. 2008,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Services include massive machine type communications desired for Industrial 4.0 along with ultra-reliable low latency services for remote healthcare and vehicular communications. In this article, we present the design of intelligent and reconfigurable physical layer (PHY) to bring these services to reality. First, we design and implement the reconfigurable PHY via a hardware-software co-design approach on system-on-chip consisting of the ARM processor and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The reconfigurable PHY is then made intelligent by augmenting it with online machine learning (OML) based decision-making algorithm. Such PHY can learn the environment (for example, wireless channel) and dynamically adapt the transceivers' configuration (i.e., modulation scheme, word-length) and select the wireless channel on-the-fly. Since the environment is unknown and changes with time, we make the OML architecture reconfigurable to enable dynamic switch between various OML algorithms on-the-fly.

As this consolidation gets stronger, the need for security in IoT increases. With first line of defense strategies like cryptography being unsuited due to the resource constrained nature, second line of defense mechanisms are crucial to ensure security in IoT networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of existing second line of defense mechanisms for standardized protocols in IoT networks.

Most importantly the system shows less focus on the security of patient&#x0027;s Data. In today&#x0027;s computer world, integrated systems with increasingly complex and functional software tools are being developed and are becoming co-partners in the pathology diagnostic toolbox on the road to personalized medicine. Recent studies have described various barriers that can spread worldwide by validating telemedicine technology for diagnostic purposes. Surgical remote pathology is of paramount importance in covering its entire range. These technical tools undoubtedly facilitate digital pathology and computational pathology, opening up new approaches to the study of the calculation of individual diseased tissues, and the practice of pathology in distant tissues. Transform rural areas without pathologists for free. Due to technical factors, impressions on workflow, and information technology infrastructure implementation of Digital Pathology is still challenging for pathologists which must have to be considered.

10.1109/ICPCSI.2017.8392290,A review of image processing leading to artificial intelligence methods to detect instruments in ultrasound guided minimally invasive surgical procedures,IEEE,Conferences,"Ultrasound is a medical diagnostic imaging modality with the ability to visualize the underlying tissues and organs in the body in realtime. A handheld probe with piezo electric crystals radiates a beam of ultrasonic sound waves in a thin plane, acoustic microphones detect the bounced sound wave and images of the underlying tissue structures are depicted on screen. The realtime advantage has led to ultrasound's alternative use as a guidance for medical treatments such as minimally invasive procedures. Minimally Invasive Surgical procedures require skillful interpretation of the ultrasound image to distinguish the location of the instrument, it's motion and maneuver it via different tissue regions to reach a specified target. A software solution which outlines the location of the instrument would greatly assist medical doctors. This review presents the problem statement and various methods utilized to detect instruments. The methods using pure image processing algorithms are presented with various ranges of success. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been explored and these show improved detection. Such applications of AI in medicine could result in a strong impact and should be advocated further.

A walking human is a dynamic varying system and in spite of the VGRF reference dependence on several patient's variables, doctors traditionally use the same static reference for all patients. The purpose of this study is to find out if an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adequate to generate the dynamic VGRF reference profiles of healthy people depending on the subject's age, weight, height and stride duration. The ELM is compared with two other baseline Computational Intelligence (CI) methods, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) and Multioutput Support Vector Regression (MSVR). Data from 28 healthy males walking at five different stride durations, collected using instrumented shoes, were used to train and test the CI models. The results showed that ELM is a well suited method to generate the dynamic VGRF reference profile for both dominant and non-dominant limbs, showing the lowest root mean square errors for the test set, 0.0201 and 0.0243 (fraction of body weight) for the dominant and non-dominant limbs respectively.

The proposed predictive analytics model is aimed at monitoring and analysing security threats unique to virtualisation in real time, providing us with the ability to mitigate these security threats before they actually happen. Predictive analytics, despite being an information technology process, has been successfully adopted in various disciplines like medicine, but not so much in information technology itself. The aim of this research is to be able to use empirical predictive analytics as a security management tool within a fully virtualised information system. In order for us to achieve empirical predictive analytics in a virtualised environment, a combination of concepts, tools and techniques, ranging from monitoring, machine learning, situation awareness, regression and instance-based learning techniques, among others, will be used. A brief description of what predictive analytics is and how it can be adopted as a security management tool in virtualised cloud computing environments is highlighted in the chapters that follow. The paper also gives a brief description of the proposed framework, the aims and objectives of the research and the methodology that will be used to achieve the objectives of the project.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7563621/,2015 International Conference on Developments of E-Systems Engineering (DeSE),13-14 Dec. 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

TCM is widely used in China and is becoming increasingly available in Europe and North America. Besides, acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body. It is a key component of TCM. In our study, we focused on the virtual acupuncture training system, which is based on the Oculus virtual headset and gesture device - Leap Motion. However, the accuracy of gesture recognition is limited by the data collection from Leap Motion.

Big data analytics, which also require the use of machine learning methods, enable the use of decision-making processes by extracting useful information from large and complex data sets. Implementing machine learning strategies on data sets within big data is an expensive process because it requires extensive use of resources such as CPU and memory. For this reason, platforms specially developed for big data analytics are designed. One of these systems, Apache Spark, has built-in machine learning algorithms ranging from regression to classification and clustering, and is a very powerful engine for real time stream processing.

This is an era of big data which is generated by different applications related to various fields like medicine, the World Wide Web, E-learning networking etc. So, we are still in need for more efficient algorithms which are computationally cost effective and thereby producing faster results. Sparse representation of data is one giant leap toward the search for a solution for big data analysis. The focus of our paper is on algorithms for sparsity-based representation of categorical data. For this, we adopt a concept from the image and signal processing domain called dictionary learning. We have successfully implemented its sparse coding stage which gives the sparse representation of data using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms (both Batch and Cholesky based) and its dictionary update stage using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We have also used a preprocessing stage where we represent the categorical dataset using a vector space model based on the TF-IDF weighting scheme. Our paper demonstrates how input data can be decomposed and approximated as a linear combination of minimum number of elementary columns of a dictionary which so formed will be a compact representation of data. Classification or clustering algorithms can now be easily performed based on the generated sparse coded coefficient matrix or based on the dictionary. We also give a comparison of the dictionary learning algorithm when applying different OMP algorithms.

10.1109/ICICIP53388.2021.9642196,Unsupervised Assisted Sleep staging Classification Algorithm under Fuzzy Few Samples,IEEE,Conferences,"Sleep staging has a strong reference value in modern medicine for doctors to judge patients’ physical and mental state and provide treatment advice. However, in reality, according to the original information of sleep Electroencephalogram (EEG), it is difficult for doctors to manually judge, and sleep staging samples are difficult to obtain, so the data is few. At the same time, the robustness of the sleep staging model obtained only by individual learning is poor. In order to solve the problem of using fuzzy few samples to design the sleep staging prediction model to provide accurate sleep staging information for doctors, an unsupervised auxiliary algorithm model is designed. Firstly, according to the data characteristics of sleep EEG signals, low-pass filtering and fast Fourier transform were performed on the EEG signals recorded during sleep. Sleep stages are performed according to the frequency parameters, and normalization is performed to highlight the wave characteristics of different components. Secondly, due to the existence of different sample data in each stage, unsupervised samples are classified and corrected by K-Means clustering method, and a more robust model is trained under the premise of ensuring the diversity of training samples. Finally, the data set divided by clustering is sent to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification learning, and the Gaussian kernel function is used to achieve high-dimensional mapping, which can reduce the impact of deviation from the center data on the sample center. The sleep staging classification algorithm designed in this paper can classify the sleep staging under the condition of fuzzy few samples, in the case of equal proportion of training set and test set, the correct rate is higher than 90 %, and in very few samples, the classification accuracy is more than 85 %.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9642196/,2021 11th International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing (ICICIP),3-7 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Large amounts of data are processed daily in order to extract useful information using machine learning techniques. Many research groups have shown impressive results on improving resolution in microscopy and quantitative phase retrieval by training DNNs on real datasets [1,2]. Recently, recovery and reconstruction of images after they have propagated through multimode optical fibers (MMFs) have also been achieved using DNNs [3,4]. When images propagate through MMFs they suffer severe scrambling because the information gets distributed among the different spatial modes that the fiber supports. Furthermore, since the fiber modes propagate with different velocities, the local information of the input decorrelates after a few millimeters along the MMF, thus resulting in the formation of a speckle pattern at the output. Recovery of information from such speckle patterns is of practical interest for integrating the MMFs for endoscopic applications in medicine or for signal recovery in telecommunications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8872523/,2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),23-27 June 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128607,AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation,IEEE,Journals,"Image segmentation was significantly enhanced after the emergence of deep learning (DL) methods. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have assisted DL-based segmentation models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields critical to human beings, such as medicine. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods often use computationally expensive operations to achieve high accuracy and lightweight networks often lack a precise medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate and efficient DCNN model (AEDCN-Net) based on an elaborate preprocessing step and a resourceful model architecture. The AEDCN-Net exploits bottleneck, atrous, and asymmetric convolution-based residual skip connections in the encoding path that reduce the number of trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) to learn feature representations with a larger receptive field. The decoding path employs the nearest-neighbor based upsampling method instead of a computationally resourceful transpose convolution operation that requires an extensive number of trainable parameters. The proposed method attains a superior performance in both computational time and accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The results of benchmarking using four real-life medical image datasets specifically illustrate that the AEDCN-Net has a faster convergence compared to the computationally expensive state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and FLOPs that result in a considerable speed-up during inference. Moreover, the proposed method obtains a better accuracy in several evaluation metrics compared with the existing lightweight and efficient methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9617630/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This problem is significant especially in medicine, where models trained on rich high-quality data extracted from large hospitals do not scale to small regional hospitals. One of the clinical challenges addressed in this work is magnetic resonance image generalization for improved visualization and diagnosis of hip abnormalities such as femoroacetabular impingement and dysplasia. Domain Generalization (DG) is a field in machine learning that tries to solve the model's dependency on the training data by leveraging many related but different data sources. We present a new method for DG that is both efficient and fast, unlike the most current state of art methods, which add a substantial computational burden making it hard to fine-tune. Our model trains an autoencoder setting on top of the classifier, but the encoder is trained on the adversarial reconstruction loss forcing it to forget style information while extracting features useful for classification. Our approach aims to force the encoder to generate domain-invariant representations that are still category informative by pushing it in both directions. Our method has proven universal and was validated on four different benchmarks for domain generalization, outperforming state of the art on RMNIST, VLCS and IXMAS with a 0.70% increase in accuracy and providing comparable results on PACS with a 0.02% difference. Our method was also evaluated for unsupervised domain adaptation and has shown to be quite an effective method against over-fitting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378518/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87&#x0025; for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21&#x0025; for localization of pneumothorax.

To address these, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Unlike most UDA methods that rely on clean labeled data or assume samples are equally transferable, we innovatively propose a Collaborative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithm, which conducts transferability-aware adaptation and conquers label noise in a collaborative way. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance of the proposed method, and also empirically evaluate it on both medical and general images.

Low-cost and compact system construction is beneficial to the application of education, biomedical research, preclinical and clinical medicine. Conversely, many aspects of the production cost, infrastructure requirements, and distributed measurements can be prohibitively expensive for them. In this article, a low-cost, compact tabletop MPI scanner based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) framework with an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) cores was proposed to address these issues. First, the proposed low-cost MPI scanner was realized by substituting discrete elements, which is affordable to cover the most economically underdeveloped regions. Besides, the ARM cores embedded in the FPGA framework which has the inherent advantages of low-power operation, are exploited to execute high-power real-time data transmission tasks instead of conventional X86. And a customized tabletop MPI system was constructed via the proposed architecture for advanced distributed MPI research. Simulative vessel experiments with commercial superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been performed in the proposed system by vessel phantoms. The experimental images showed that the proposed system could achieved an image resolution of approximately 2 mm, which can distinguish spatial locations of brain veins (2&#x2013;4 mm in diameter). Moreover, the experiment of distributed transmission showed that the proposed system could perform the collection and transmission of distributed particle signals based on the inherent user datagram protocol (UDP) network transmission protocol with an average round trip time (RTT) of 28.044 ms.

A soft sensor probe provides a good surface adaptation and forces transfer, but it introduces nonlinearities and noisy measurements, making it difficult to control the probe during a real time test by conventional algorithms. In this work, a data driven controller is developed to control force and pose of a soft contact ultrasound sensor. The adaptive controller is based on a fuzzy-rules emulated network structure with the learning algorithm using a stochastic gradient approximation. The proposed control algorithm overcomes the noise environment conditions and nonlinearities of the unknown nonlinear discrete-time system.

As an example, a hospital service robot is told to deliver medicine to Patient Two in Ward Three. Without awareness of what “Patient Two” or “Ward Three” is, a service robot must systematically explore the environment to perform this task, which requires a long time. The implementation of a Semantic Map allows for robots to perceive the environment similar to people by associating semantic information with spatial information found in geometric maps. Currently, many semantic mapping works provide insufficient or incorrect semantic-metric information to allow a service robot to function dynamically in human-centric environments. This paper proposes a semantic map with a hierarchical semantic organization structure based on a hybrid metric-topological map leveraging convolutional neural networks and spatial room segmentation methods.

Among community detection methods, label propagation technology is widely used because of its linear time complexity. However, due to the randomness of the node order of label updating and the order of label launching in label propagation, the instability of community detection approaches based on label propagation becomes a challenge. In this paper, a new label propagation algorithm, Node Ability based Label Propagation Algorithm (NALPA), is proposed to discover communities in networks. Inspired from human society and radar transmission, we design four node abilities (propagation ability, attraction ability, launch ability and acceptance ability), label influence and a new label propagation mechanism to deal with the instability and enhance the efficiency. Experimental results on 42 synthetic and 14 real-world networks demonstrate that NALPA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in most cases.

10.1109/TVCG.2004.30,Point-based probabilistic surfaces to show surface uncertainty,IEEE,Journals,"Efficient and informative visualization of surfaces with uncertainties is an important topic with many applications in science and engineering. In these applications, the correct course of action may depend not only on the location of a boundary, but on the precision with which that location is known. Examples include environmental pollution borderline detection, oil basin edge characterization, or discrimination between cancerous and healthy tissue in medicine. We present a method for producing visualizations of surfaces with uncertainties using points as display primitives. Our approach is to render the surface as a collection of points and to displace each point from its original location along the surface normal by an amount proportional to the uncertainty at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudocoloring to produce efficient and revealing visualizations. The basic approach is sufficiently flexible to allow natural extensions; we show incorporation of expressive modulation of opacity, change of the stroke primitive, and addition of an underlying polygonal model. The method is used to visualize real and simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries. The point-based technique is compared to pseudocoloring for a position estimation task in a preliminary user study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1310282/,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,Sept.-Oct. 2004,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

People began to realize that contrasting physical (real) age and predicted brain age can help to highlight brain issues and evaluate if patients&#x2019; brains are healthy or not. Such age prediction is often challenging for single model-based prediction, while the conditions of brains vary drastically over age. In this work, we present an age-adaptive ensemble model that is based on the combination of four different machine learning algorithms, including a support vector machine (SVR), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the popular GoogLeNet and ResNet deep networks. The ensemble model proposed here is nonlinearly adaptive, where age is taken as a key factor in the nonlinear combination of various single-algorithm-based independent models. In our age-adaptive ensemble method, the weights of each model are learned automatically as nonlinear functions over age instead of fixed values, while brain age estimation is based on such an age-adaptive integration of various single models. The quality of the model is quantified by the mean absolute errors (MAE) and spearman correlation between the predicted age and the actual age, with the least MAE and the highest Spearman correlation representing the highest accuracy in age prediction. By testing on the Predictive Analysis Challenge 2019 (PAC 2019) dataset, our novel ensemble model has achieved a MAE down to 3.19, which is a significantly increased accuracy in this brain age competition. If deployed in the real world, our novel ensemble model having an improved accuracy could potentially help doctors to identify the risk of brain diseases more accurately and quickly, thus helping pharmaceutical companies develop drugs or treatments precisely, and potential offer a new powerful tool for researchers in the field of brain science.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9828516/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Against this background, the assessment and treatment of geriatric conditions have become increasingly important. This study draws on the multisensory integration of virtual reality (VR) devices in the field of rehabilitation to assess brain function in young and old people. The study is based on multimodal data generated by combining high temporal resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) and subjective scales and behavioural indicators reflecting motor abilities. The phase locking value (PLV) was chosen as an indicator of functional connectivity (FC), and six brain regions, namely LPFC, RPFC, LOL, ROL, LMC and RMC, were analysed. The results showed a significant difference in the alpha band on comparing the resting and task states in the younger group. A significant difference between the two states in the alpha and beta bands was observed when comparing task states in the younger and older groups. Meanwhile, this study affirms that advancing age significantly affects human locomotor performance and also has a correlation with cognitive level.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely “VA-assisted ML”. The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed feature selection based classification algorithm is better than the traditional algorithms in terms of true positive rate, error rate and F-measure are concerned.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8482045/,2018 IEEE 17th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),16-18 July 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained, heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors. Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis.

However, in a real-world situation, the deployment of a federated learning system among hospitals requires heavy investment in computing and network infrastructure. Under such a case, making investment effective across computing power and network capability is essential.

The authors propose a fuzzy naive Bayesian (FNB) model for medical diagnosis, which extends the fuzzy Bayesian approach proposed by Okuda. A physician's interview based method is described to define a orthogonal fuzzy symptom information system, required to apply the model. For the purpose of elaboration and elicitation of characteristics, the algorithm is applied to a simple simulated dataset, and compared with conventional naive Bayes (NB) approach. As a preliminary evaluation of FNB in real world scenario, the comparison is repeated on a real fuzzy dataset of 81 patients diagnosed with infectious diseases. The case study on simulated dataset elucidates that FNB can be optimal over NB for diagnosing patients with imprecise-fuzzy information, on account of the following characteristics - 1) it can model the information that, values of some attributes are semantically closer than values of other attributes, and 2) it offers a mechanism to temper exaggerations in patient information. Although the algorithm requires precise training data, its utility for fuzzy training data is argued for. This is supported by the case study on infectious disease dataset, which indicates optimality of FNB over NB for the infectious disease domain. Further case studies on large datasets are required to establish utility of FNB.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5332468/,2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,3-6 Sept. 2009,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based medical auxiliary diagnosis system, the impact of label noise problems is also increasing. When training a machine learning algorithm for a supervised-learning task in some clinical applications, uncertainty in the labels of some patients may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, due to ambiguous patient conditions or poor reliability of diagnostic criteria, even clinical experts may lack confidence in making medical diagnoses for some patients. As a result, some samples used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, which adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we study a classification problem of sample labels with random damage. We propose a new hybrid label noise correction model that generalizes many learning problems, including supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. This hybrid model can withstand the negative effects of random noise and various non-random label noise.

10.1109/DSNW.2012.6264658,Invited talk: Challenges in Medical Cyber-Physical Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only given. As computers and communication bandwidth become ever faster and cheaper, computing and communication capabilities are embedded in all types of objects and structures in the physical environment. Harnessing these capabilities to bridge the cyber-world with the physical world will allow the development of applications with great societal impact and economic benefit. At the heart of these applications are cyber-physical systems consisting of integrated computational and communication cores that interact with the physical world, with intelligence provided by embedded software. Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are engineered systems that provide tight integration of and coordination between the cyber world of computing and communications and the physical world. CPS are to meet the needs of the new generation of engineered systems that are highly dependable, efficiently produced and certified, and capable of advanced performance in computation, communication, and control. CPS will transform how we interact with and control the physical world around us, as the Internet transformed how we interact and communicate with one another and revolutionized how and where we access information. One application domain of CPS is Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), which are life-critical, context-aware, networked systems of medical devices. Medical device industry is undergoing a transformation, embracing the potential of embedded software and network connectivity. Instead of stand-alone devices that can be designed, certified, and used to treat patients independent of each other, distributed systems that simultaneously control multiple aspects of the patient's physiology are increasingly used in hospitals to provide high-quality continuous care for patients. The combination of embedded software controlling medical devices, networking capabilities, and complicated physiological dynamics of patient bodies makes MCPS complex. The need to design complex MCPS that are both safe and effective presents numerous challenges, including achieving high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certification. In this talk, I will discuss these challenges in developing MCPS and present some of our work in addressing them, and several open research and development issues.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6264658/,IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN 2012),25-28 June 2012,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00303,Large-scale Robust Deep AUC Maximization: A New Surrogate Loss and Empirical Studies on Medical Image Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. Most previous works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss function for the AUC score (named as the AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii) classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii) classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv) classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the new AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets.

The high compute resources required by these large networks are alienating the majority of the world population that lives in low-resource settings and lacks the infrastructure to benefit from these advancements in medical AI. Current state-of-the-art medical AI, even with cloud resources, is a bit difficult to deploy in remote areas where we don&#x2019;t have good internet connectivity. We demonstrate a cost-effective approach to deploying medical AI that could be used in limited resource settings using Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).

Thereafter, we compiled the optimized models for Edge TPU execution. We find that the inference performance on edge TPUs is 10x faster compared to other embedded devices. The optimized model is 3x and 12x smaller for the classification and segmentation respectively, compared to the full precision model. In summary, we show the potential of Edge TPUs for two medical AI tasks with faster inference times, which could potentially be used in low-resource settings for medical AI-based diagnostics.

Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287685/,2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV),16-19 May 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The performance of medical image recognition models highly depends on the representativeness and sufficiency of training samples. The high expense of collecting large amounts of practical medical images leads to a demand of synthesizing image samples. In this research, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of a generative network and a discriminative network, are applied to develop a medical image synthesis model. Specifically, deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and boundary equilibrium GANs (BEGANs) are implemented and compared to synthesize medical images in this research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied in the GAN models, which can capture feature representations that describe a high level of image semantic information. Then synthetic images are generated by employing the generative network mapping from random noise. The effectiveness of the generative network is validated by a discriminative network, which is trained to detect the synthetic images from real images. Through a minimax two-player game, the generative and discriminative networks can train each other. The generated synthetic images are used to train a CNN classification model for tissue recognition.

10.1109/SVR51698.2020.00059,Prototyping Virtual Reality Interactions in Medical Simulation Employing Speech Recognition,IEEE,Conferences,"Medical simulation has seen the adoption of virtual reality as a tool to expose learners to scenarios otherwise impossible in real life. In medical simulation, patient interactions are practiced employing standardized patients (i.e., actors) and most recently artificial intelligence driven avatars. Typical avatar interactions found in virtual simulators rely on buttons, text boxes, and drop-down menus to enable the interactions. While a similar approach is also employed in virtual reality, virtual keyboard inputs and point and click tasks on graphical user interface items using a mouse can be challenging and lead to increased cognitive loads. In this paper, we outline an application for virtual avatar communication by employing speech recognition and gestures to convey non-verbal cues during an eye fundus examination. Our goal is to understand the face validity of speech and gesture driven interactions. A demo was conducted at an open house were attendees tried the scenario and provided their opinions on the experience. From this preliminary experience, we were able to identify challenges and opportunities when deploying speech-based interactions outside a controlled laboratory space.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9262693/,2020 22nd Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR),7-10 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

First, we have done extensive research on the medical care situation and the hospitals' problems in China and conclude that reducing the triage pressure is of great importance for hospitals. We then collect the medical Question Answering datasets, including questions and answers with symptom tags. According to the form of our data, we use BERT, a mainstream model in Natural Language Processing, as the base of our system and modify it with additional components specified to our task. We developed two models based on different datasets. One is trained by data from the five most frequent symptom tags. And for the other one, we use the whole dataset by identifying the appearance of special words, measuring the overlap of all the tags, and merging them into 20 categories. Both of them utilize several training techniques and result in relatively high accuracy: top1 85% accuracy and top2 accuracy 96% on the smaller dataset, top1 accuracy 66.2%, and top2 accuracy 78.3% on the other one. Then we analyze the results and build up our web system for medical use. If given real-world data with similar data distribution, our system could help patients judge diseases and alleviate the triage problem in medical treatment to a certain extent.

The current testing regime based on Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV-2 has been unable to keep up with testing demands, and also suffers from a relatively low positive detection rate in the early stages of the resultant COVID-19 disease. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach for repeated large-scale testing of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) points to a promising approach to address this challenge. WMSs enable continuous and user-transparent monitoring of physiological signals. However, disease detection based on WMSs/DNNs and their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging problems. To address these problems, we propose a framework called CovidDeep that combines efficient DNNs with commercially available WMSs for pervasive testing of the virus and the resultant disease. CovidDeep does not depend on manual feature extraction. It directly operates on WMS data and some easy-to-answer questions in a questionnaire whose answers can be obtained through a smartphone application. We collected data from 87 individuals, spanning three cohorts including healthy, asymptomatic (to detect the virus), and symptomatic (to detect the disease) patients. We trained DNNs on various subsets of the features automatically extracted from six WMS and questionnaire categories to perform ablation studies to determine which subsets are most efficacious in terms of test accuracy for a three-way classification. The highest test accuracy obtained was 98.1%. The models were also shown to perform well on other performance measures, such as false positive rate, false negative rate, and F1 score. We augmented the real training dataset with a synthetic training dataset drawn from the same probability distribution to impose a prior on DNN weights and leveraged a grow-and-prune synthesis paradigm to learn both DNN architecture and weights. This boosted the accuracy of the various DNNs further and simultaneously reduced their size and floating-point operations. This makes the CovidDeep DNNs both accurate and efficient, in terms of memory requirements and computations. The resultant DNNs are embedded in a smartphone application, which has the added benefit of preserving patient privacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9626158/,IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,Nov. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The EMR can utilize various data formats, such as numerical data, text, and images. Mining the information and knowledge hidden in the huge amount of EMR data is an essential requirement for clinical decision support, such as clinical pathway formulation and evidence-based medical research. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based framework to mine the hidden medication patterns in EMR text. The framework systematically integrates the Jaccard similarity evaluation, spectral clustering, the modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation and cross-matching among multiple features to find the residuals that describe additional knowledge and clusters hidden in multiple perspectives of highly complex medication patterns. These methods work together, step by step to reveal the underlying medication pattern.

The proposed framework outperforms other approaches for medication pattern discovery, especially for this disease with subtle medication treatment variances.

10.1109/TMI.2021.3098703,Efficient Medical Image Segmentation Based on Knowledge Distillation,IEEE,Journals,"Recent advances have been made in applying convolutional neural networks to achieve more precise prediction results for medical image segmentation problems. However, the success of existing methods has highly relied on huge computational complexity and massive storage, which is impractical in the real-world scenario. To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient architecture by distilling knowledge from well-trained medical image segmentation networks to train another lightweight network. This architecture empowers the lightweight network to get a significant improvement on segmentation capability while retaining its runtime efficiency. We further devise a novel distillation module tailored for medical image segmentation to transfer semantic region information from teacher to student network. It forces the student network to mimic the extent of difference of representations calculated from different tissue regions. This module avoids the ambiguous boundary problem encountered when dealing with medical imaging but instead encodes the internal information of each semantic region for transferring. Benefited from our module, the lightweight network could receive an improvement of up to 32.6% in our experiment while maintaining its portability in the inference phase. The entire structure has been verified on two widely accepted public CT datasets LiTS17 and KiTS19. We demonstrate that a lightweight network distilled by our method has non-negligible value in the scenario which requires relatively high operating speed and low storage usage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9491090/,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This is because the scale step is limited by conditional stability of explicit schemes. We introduce the unconditionally stable semiimplicit linearized difference scheme that is fashioned after additive operator split (AOS) [Weickert, J. et al. (1998)], [Goldenberg, R et al., (2001)] for Beltrami and the subjective surface computation. The Beltrami flow [Kimmel, R. (1997) (1999)], [Sochen, N. et al. (1998)], is one of the most effective denoising algorithms in image processing. For gray-level images, we show that the flow equation can be arranged in an advection-diffusion form, revealing the edge-enhancing properties of this flow. This also suggests the application of AOS method for faster convergence. The subjective surface [Sarti, A. et al. (2002)] deals with constructing a perceptually meaningful interpretation from partial image data by mimicking the human visual system. However, initialization of the surface is critical for the final result and its main drawbacks are very slow convergence and the huge number of iterations required. We first show that the governing equation for the subjective surface flow can be rearranged in an AOS implementation, providing a near real-time solution to the shape completion problem in 2D and 3D. Then, we devise a new initialization paradigm where we first ""condition"" the viewpoint surface using the fast-marching algorithm.

However, a scheduled surgical workflow is often required to be updated based on the patient&#x2019;s internal tissue states. Perioperative complications could occur if in-time adjustments are lacking in the operating rooms when needed. To help manage the uncertainty of live surgical workflows in the IoMT environment, we propose a MIS safety improvement framework. It helps surgeons in predicting surgical workflows with limited MIS video frames by embedding our proposed model GuidedNet. To predict future surgical activities, we first build three isomorphic neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal information. Then, we establish a guidance fusion module to handle the contextual information. It guides the GuidedNet to recognize the surgical stage. Moreover, we build a novel joint loss function to train the GuidedNet to predict the future surgical stage. We evaluate the approach on a large data set that contains 80 cholecystectomy videos (Cholec-80) and compare it with the state of the art. Experiments show that the GuidedNet can assist surgeons in carrying out MIS as well as guide the next stage of surgery for improving surgical safety. Comparing to the state of the art, our approach can obtain better predict accuracy (up to 79&#x0025;) with less computing resource consumption.

Although there are many frameworks focusing on training neural networks, there are few that focus on high performance inference and visualization of medical images. Neural network inference requires an inference engine (IE), and there are currently several IEs available including Intel's OpenVINO, NVIDIA's TensorRT, and Google's TensorFlow which supports multiple backends, including NVIDIA's cuDNN, AMD's ROCm and Intel's MKL-DNN. These IEs only work on specific processors and have completely different application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we presents methods for extending FAST, an open-source high performance framework for medical imaging, to use any IE with a common programming interface. Thereby making it easier for users to deploy and test their neural networks on different processors. This article provides an overview of current IEs and how they can be combined with existing software such as FAST. The methods are demonstrated and evaluated on three performance demanding medical use cases: real-time ultrasound image segmentation, computed tomography (CT) volume segmentation, and patch-wise classification of whole slide microscopy images. Runtime performance was measured on the three use cases with several different IEs and processors. This revealed that the choice of IE and processor can affect performance of medical neural network image analysis considerably. In the most extreme case of processing 171 ultrasound frames, the difference between the fastest and slowest configuration were half a second vs. 24 seconds. For volume processing, using the CPU or the GPU, showed a difference of 2 vs. 53 seconds, and for processing an whole slide microscopy image, the difference was 81 seconds vs. almost 16 minutes.

In medical scenarios, a well-trained classifier can effectively detect a disease with sufficient features associating with medical tests. However, such features are not always readily available due to the high cost of time and money associating with medical tests. To address this, this study identifies the diagnostic strategy learning problem and proposes a novel framework consisting of three components to learn a diagnostic strategy with limited features. First, as we often encounter incomplete medical records of the patients, a sequence encoder is designed to encode any set of information in various sizes into fixed-length vectors. Second, taking the output of the encoder as the input, a feature selector based on reinforcement learning techniques is proposed to learn the best feature sequence for diagnosis. Finally, with the best feature sequence, an oracle classifier is used to give the final diagnosis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on nine real medical datasets. The results suggest that the proposed method is effective for providing personalized diagnostic strategies and makes better diagnoses with fewer features compared with existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9448279/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual's body movement and also via human-computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy-the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% (N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively.

Despite the availability of numerous anti-epileptic drugs, it is often impossible to control the disease effectively. Lack of supervision, and failure to provide urgent medical care may be detrimental to the life of the patient. Hence a portable edge computing and seizure classification device to aid medical staff and provide appropriate and timely treatment to the patients is desirable. Conventionally, seizure detection is considered as a signal processing problem with electroencephalogram (EEG) as the primary source of a time-varying signal. The EEG signal acquisition system puts the patient under observation with a lot of discomforts owing to a large number of physical connections of electrodes on the patient&#x2019;s head. A video-based portable system not only eliminates the physical connections and contacts to the patient but also has the capacity of monitoring a large group of patients inside a controlled care unit. This paper proposes a novel architecture for the detection and classification of facial seizures of type Gelastic and Dacrystic, from the video data of the patient. The developed two layered architecture was deployed on a portable Jetson Nano board and an accuracy of 98.8&#x0025; in detection and classification of Gelastic and Dacrystic seizures was obtained.

DNN models reach impressive performances in several sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis, smart transport or security threat detection, and represent a valuable piece of Intellectual Property. Over the last few years, a major trend is the large-scale deployment of models in a wide variety of devices. However, this migration to embedded systems is slowed down because of the broad spectrum of attacks threatening the integrity, confidentiality and availability of embedded models. In this review, we cover the landscape of attacks targeting the confidentiality of embedded DNN models that may have a major impact on critical IoT systems, with a particular focus on model extraction and data leakage. We highlight the fact that Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) is a relatively unexplored bias by which model’s confidentiality can be compromised.

Human gesture used for Man-Machine Interaction became attractive as it offers a simpler way of controlling sophisticated devices, in a sci-fi-like scenario, in return of an increasingly computational power required by the artificial intelligence algorithms needed to detect, track and recognize them. There have been attempts to bring a solution to it by using 2D or 3D based image processing methods. There is a clear balance incline towards 3D methods in the consumer product as besides the almost insurmountable difficulties for producing robust and stable results, the price constraint added supplementary hurdles. As perfect illumination conditions are core factors in obtaining the above results, the infrared light was unanimously adopted by the domain technologies. In this paper, a novel real-time depth-mapping principle and a corresponding hardware solution for an IR depth-mapping camera is introduced. The new IR camera architecture comprises an illuminator module which is pulsed and modulated via a monotonic function using a phase-locked loop control for the laser intensity, while the reflected infrared light is captured during the increasing and decreasing monotonic function. A reconfigurable hardware architecture (RHA) unit calculates the depth and controls the IR waves in synchronism with the infrared sensor. The resolution of the depth map is variable depending on the resolution and gating possibilities of the image sensor. A sensor of 1 megapixel is used, providing a resolution of 1024×1024. Images of real objects are reconstructed in 3D based on the data obtained by the laser controlled by the RHA. A corresponding image processing algorithm builds the 3D map of the object in real-time.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4).

Before giving treatment, the main challenge is to detect and classify tumors from brain MRI images. Researchers have been working really hard for ages to find the best method with higher accuracy for implementing them in real life medical image classification. The main problem is that when a classifier deals with huge amount of data it becomes difficult to classify them accurately. To solve this a CNN-SVM based method is proposed to classify brain tumor with higher accuracy. Firstly, a convolutional neural network having 19 layers is constructed using three convolutional 2D layers, three max-pooling layers, two fully-connected layers, three batch-normalization layers with activation functions reLu.

On the other hand, the training data in the current scenario is not sufficient to learn a predictive model effectively yet. In order to overcome these problems and construct an efficient classifier, for these real situations in medical fields, in this work we present an approach based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), which utilizes a transfer learning framework to make maximum use of the data and guarantee its enhanced generalization capability. The proposed approach is capable of effectively learning a target domain with limited samples by relying on the probabilistic outputs from the other previously learned model using a heterogeneous method in the source domain. Moreover, it autonomously and quickly decides how much output knowledge to transfer from source domain to the target one using a fast leave-one-out cross validation strategy.

Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fr&#x00E9;chet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them.

In the field of medical domain, the extraction of features from real-time images of cancer CT has becoming challenging. The incorporation of machine learning in medical data could explore the salient features that could be used for exploring patterns which then aids in decision making process.Motivation The realm of determining the accuracy of the observed medical image serves as an important factor in accessing image quality and recognition. The quality of image acquisition and analysis lies at quality factors such as range, sharpness, color, fare of lens, artifacts, and tone reproduction. The mechanism of automatic prediction is being useful for a number of practical applications, but if there is a systematic means of accessing the sections of poor quality of subsequent images in medical informatics it can be helpful for assessment and evaluation to determine flags and noise thereby rendering quality-based fusion on all observed images.Objective The objective is to validate the accuracy of cancer CT images using machine learning techniques. The assessment is made in accordance with the deployment of Convolution Neural Network with the enhancement in the image quality features.Methodology The process of assessment and evaluation involves training the dataset with proposed quality metrics. Once trained then it is modeled using CNN with ELM and its training parameters. Once modeled then tested accordingly with automatic prediction with quality factors and detecting sections of poor fusion focusing on interpretation and evaluation.Results and Conclusion The analyses of lung Computerized Tomography (CT) has various interventional variations which can significant degrade the level of accuracy.

Deep learning has been proven to achieve state-of-the-art performance in BG prediction. However, it is usually seen as a very computationally expensive approach, hence difficult to implement in wearable medical devices such as transmitters in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework to predict BG levels with the edge inference on a microcontroller unit embedded in a low- power system. By using glucose measurements from a CGM sensor and a recurrent neural network that builds on long-short term memory, the personalized models achieves state-of-the-art performance on a clinical data set obtained from 12 subjects with T1D. In particular, the proposed method achieves an average root mean square error of 19.10 ± 2.04 for a 30-minute prediction horizon (PH) and 32.61 ± 3.45 for a 60-minute PH with high clinical accuracy. Notably, the framework has been optimized to achieve a minimum use of hardware resources (34KB FLASH and 1KB SRAM) as well as an execution time of 22 ms for low power operations (8 μW).

However, current diagnosis depends on dozens of factors, including the family member, past medical problems, tests of memory, blood and urine tests, brain scans and even cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Among them, regular features (e.g., blood and urine tests, brain scans) are simple and accurate. Privileged features (e.g., tests of memory, cerebrospinal fluid specimens) are inconvenient and uncomfortable to acquire, and thus incomplete in most cases. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework to predict merely using the regular feature with the aid of incomplete privileged data in the training time. In particular, we first complement the missing data of privileged features by exploring the relationship with regular features and labels. The recovered privileged features, regular features, as well as labels, are combined as a new set of privileged features. Then privileged learning via matching logits is applied to boost the diagnosis accuracy.

The focus of this research is to develop a method by which undirected influence structures, here in the form of undirected Bayesian network skeletons, can be recovered from observations by means of some pairwise similarity function, either a statistical measure of correlation or some problem-specific measure. In this research, we present two algorithms to construct undirected influence structures from observations. The first makes use of a threshold value to filter out relations denoting weak influence, and the second constructs a maximum weighted spanning tree over the complete set of relations. In addition, we present a modification to the minimum graph edit distance (GED) [1], which we refer to as the modified scaled GED, in order to evaluate the performance of these algorithms in reconstructing known structures. We perform a number of experiments in reconstructing known Bayesian network structures, including a real-world medical network [2]. Our analysis shows that these algorithms outperform a random reconstruction (modified scaled GED ≈ 0.5), and can regularly achieve modified scaled GED scores better than 0.3 in sparse cases and 0.45 in dense cases.

However, due to factors such as hardware and scanning time, CT images in real scenes are limited by spatial resolution so that doctors cannot perform accurate disease analysis on tiny lesion areas and pathological features. An image super-resolution (SR) method based on deep learning is a good way to solve this problem. Although many excellent networks have been proposed, but they all pay more attention to image quality indicators than image visual perception quality. Unlike other networks that focus more on image evaluation metrics, the super resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) has achieved tremendous improvements in image perception quality. Based on the above, this paper proposes a CT image super-resolution algorithm based on improved SRGAN. In order to improve the visual quality of CT images, a dilated convolution module is introduced. At the same time, in order to improve the overall visual effect of the image, the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) loss is also introduced to improve the perceptual loss function. Experimental results on the public CT image dataset demonstrate that our model is better than the baseline method SRGAN not only in mean opinion score(MOS), but also in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) values.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9118497/,2020 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS),15-18 May 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such a database consists of multiple relations which are linked together conceptually via entity-relationship links in the design of relational database schemas. Multirelational classification can be widely used in many disciplines, such as financial decision-making, medical research, and geographical applications. However, most classification approaches only work on single ""flat"" data relations. It is usually difficult to convert multiple relations into a single flat relation without either introducing huge, undesirable ""universal relation"" or losing essential information. Previous works using inductive logic programming approaches (recently also known as relational mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multi-relational classification. Unfortunately, they suffer from poor scalability w.r.t. the number of relations and the number of attributes in databases. We propose CrossMine, an efficient and scalable approach for multirelational classification. Several novel methods are developed in CrossMine, including (1) tuple ID propagation, which performs semantics-preserving virtual join to achieve high efficiency on databases with complex schemas, and (2) a selective sampling method, which makes it highly scalable w.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases.

In light of this trend, we propose an approach for the unsupervised latent direction search of black-box models that are steerable to the user by enabling the user to effectively explore counterfactual generation in a directional way, without relying on domain- or data-specific assumptions. To identify these explainable directions, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a general manifold learning framework to extract low-dimensional subspaces based on a local noise injection of the pre-trained generative model, so that a small perturbation in the subspaces would provide enough change in the resulting data.

However, large labeled data sets are generally needed for the training and validation of such models. In many domains, unlabeled data is available but labeling is expensive, for instance when specific expert knowledge is required. Active Learning (AL) is one approach to mitigate the problem of limited labeled data. Through selecting the most informative and representative data instances for labeling, AL can contribute to more efficient learning of a model. Recent AL methods for CNNs propose different solutions for the selection of such instances. However, they do not perform consistently well and are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel AL algorithm that efficiently learns from unlabeled data by capturing high prediction uncertainty. By replacing the softmax standard output of a CNN with the parameters of a Dirichlet density, the model learns to identify data instances that contribute efficiently to improving model performance during training. We demonstrate in several experiments with publicly available data that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art AL approaches.

When models learn spurious correlations not found in real-world situations, their deployment for critical tasks, such as medical decisions, can be catastrophic. In this work we address this issue for skin-lesion classification models, with two objectives: finding out what are the spurious correlations exploited by biased networks, and debiasing the models by removing such spurious correlations from them. We perform a systematic integrated analysis of 7 visual artifacts (which are possible sources of biases exploitable by networks), employ a state-of-the-art technique to prevent the models from learning spurious correlations, and propose datasets to test models for the presence of bias. We find out that, despite interesting results that point to promising future research, current debiasing methods are not ready to solve the bias issue for skin-lesion models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9150714/,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW),14-19 June 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/IWECAI55315.2022.00054,Deep Bidirectional GRU network for human activity recognition using Wearable inertial sensors,IEEE,Conferences,"Human activity recognition (HAR) has a wide range of applications in medical care, elderly care and so on. Due to the development of wearable sensor technology, HAR based on wearable sensors has gradually become a hot research topic. In terms of feature extraction of raw data, traditional methods usually use manually extracted features, which has many limitations. The method based on deep learning has gradually become the mainstream. In this paper, a deep bidirectional GRU network for human activity recognition is proposed, which uses few data preprocessing to classify and recognize daily activities. An accuracy rate of 95.69&#x0025; is achieved on the UCL-HAR dataset which is an increase of 2.8&#x0025; compared to the bidirectional LSTM network. In addition, the proposed method in this paper reduces the training time by 11.8 &#x0025;, which will help the neural network to be deployed in real-time applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750802/,2022 3rd International Conference on Electronic Communication and Artificial Intelligence (IWECAI),14-16 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ISMR48346.2021.9661529,Deep Learning for Needle Detection in a Cannulation Simulator,IEEE,Conferences,"Cannulation for hemodialysis is the act of inserting a needle into a surgically created vascular access (e.g., an arteriovenous fistula) for the purpose of dialysis. The main risk associated with cannulation is infiltration, the puncture of the wall of the vascular access after entry, which can cause medical complications. Simulator-based training allows clinicians to gain cannulation experience without putting patients at risk. In this paper, we propose to use deep-learning-based techniques for detecting, based on video, whether the needle tip is in or has infiltrated the simulated fistula. Three categories of deep neural networks are investigated in this work: modified pre-trained models based on VGG-16 and ResNet-50, light convolutional neural networks (light CNNs), and convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). CRNNs consist of convolutional layers and a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. A data set of cannulation experiments was collected and analyzed. The results show that both the light CNN (test accuracy: 0.983) and the CRNN (test accuracy: 0.983) achieve better performance than the pre-trained baseline models (test accuracy 0.968 for modified VGG-16 and 0.971 for modified ResNet-50). The CRNN was implemented in real time on commodity hardware for use in the cannulation simulator, and the performance was verified. Deep-learning video analysis is a viable method for detecting needle state in a low cost cannulation simulator.

Although significant progress has been made in emotion recognition for music, image and video stimuli, it remains largely unexplored for immersive virtual stimuli. Our main objective for this line of investigation is to enable consistently reliable emotion recognition for virtual reality stimuli using only cheap, commercial-off-the-shelf electroencephalography (EEG) headsets which have significantly less recording channels and far lower signal resolution commonly called “Wearable EEG” as opposed to medical-grade EEG headsets with the ultimate goal of applying EEG-based emotion prediction to procedurally-generated affective content such as immersive computer games and virtual learning environments through machine learning. Our prior preliminary study has found that the use of a 4-channel, 256-Hz was indeed able to perform the required emotion recognition tasks from VR stimuli albeit at classification rates of between 65-89% classification accuracy only using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers. For this particular study, we attempt to improve the classification rates to above 95% by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the use of various deep neural-based learning architectures for this domain. By tuning the deep neural classifiers in terms of the number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes and the nodal dropout ratio, the emotion prediction accuracy was able to be improved to over 96%. This shows the continued promise of the application of wearable EEG for emotion prediction as a cost-effective and userfriendly approach for consistent and reliable prediction deployment in virtual reality-related content and environments through deep learning approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8538382/,2018 International Conference on Smart Computing and Electronic Enterprise (ICSCEE),11-12 July 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest an approach based on a deep learning model for an attack simulation on specific IoMT protocols that discovers the private key of IoMT wireless communications using a smart eavesdropping conceptual scenario on multilevel layers of IoMT protocol stack for its implementation.

However, firstly, these techniques have the black box characteristics that prevent the medical professionals from completely trusting the results generated from them. Secondly, the lack of precision of these methods restricts their implementation in clinical and complex cases, and finally, the existing works and models on the OCT classification are substantially large and complicated and they require a considerable amount of memory and computational power, reducing the quality of classifiers in real-time applications. To meet these problems, in this paper a self-developed CNN model has been proposed which is comparatively smaller and simpler along with the use of Lime that introduces Explainable AI to the study and helps to increase the interpretability of the model.

Firstly, as operational data of the organization is in relational form, stored in Microsoft SQL Server database, therefore rule engine, using the native language, works at real time without any need of data transformation for working memory. Secondly due to SQL server, rule engine is using interpreted approach instead of compiled approach, which helps dynamic updating, editing and execution of rules. A rule is represented as a query stored in database, along with associated attributes like rule name, rule description and rule priority. `where' clause of query contains condition and then part of the rule.

Use of smartphones for activity recognition poses new challenges such as variation in hardware configuration and usage behavior like where the smartphone is kept. Only a few works address one or more of these challenges. Consequently, in this paper we present an activity recognition framework for identifying both static and dynamic activities addressing above mentioned challenges in order to make the framework ubiquitous. Since accelerometer is widely available in many smartphone configurations, activities are detected based on accelerometer readings only. The framework forms a two-phase classifier to address the variance due to different hardware configuration and usage behavior in terms of where the smartphone is kept (pant pocket, shirt pocket or bag).

10.1109/NSS/MIC42677.2020.9508035,Estimating Ensemble Bias using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are powerful tools in many medical imaging applications including denoising. However, a major concern in deploying a CNN in safety-critical areas is to access its prediction accuracy on out-of-distribution test samples. Our previous study showed that while a CNN could generate similar ensemble standard deviation levels on inputs with different noise levels, the magnitude and location of bias could be substantially different. These observations imply that although CNNs can generate visually high-quality images from each individual dataset, the bias might be higher in one image than the other, which might lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial for us to understand when and where a CNN is uncertain about its prediction in real clinical datasets. In this study, we investigate the use of a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) to estimate an uncertainty map of its prediction, and assess its correlations with the ensemble bias of its own and a conventional CNN's prediction ensemble bias, respectively. The BCNN is implemented by adding Monte Carlo dropout layers after each convolution and ReLU layer, which is equivalent to imposing a Bernoulli prior distribution on the network weights. At the testing stage, we acquire multiple stochastic forward passes through the network to generate the uncertainty map. We applied BCNN and CNN on two 18F-FDG scans, with one whole-body scan which is considered as an in-distribution test sample, and one brain only study which is considered as an out-of-distribution sample. For the whole-body scan, we generated 10 noise realizations for ensemble analysis using bootstrap. Our results demonstrate that BCNN can generate a prediction uncertainty map that highly correlates with the ensemble bias map.

Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data.

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to this task, the classification performance and reliability are not satisfied for medical clinical requirements. Specifically, DNNs are regarded as unexplainable “black-box” in general, and, thus, are not deemed reliable by expects. In this paper, we propose a neural network structure search approach based on evolutionary algorithm to improve the DNN's effectiveness and interpretability, and applied to the pulmonary textures classification problem. Through this network structure search approach, we find out how a DNN's subnet recognize the pulmonary textures features, then filter out the redundant subnets, and retain the most distinctive feature subnets. Besides, we utilize the method of feature visualization and the fine-grained heat map of the activation to interpret network's decision-making process. Finally, through quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate on a real dataset of diffuse lung disease, we verify the effectiveness of this neural network structure search approach on VggNet and ResNet, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

However, it can be life threatening if left untreated or undiagnosed. This paper introduces an improved method to classify heart arrhythmia from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using Block-based Neural Networks (BbNN). BbNNs are used in the hardware implementation of this problem due to its regular block based structure, relatively fast computational speeds, and lower resource consumption.

With the limited failure examples collected during the practical operation, how to effectively leverage such failure cases to repair and enhance DNN so as to generalize to more potentially suspicious samples is challenging, but of great importance. In this paper, we formulate the failure-data-driven DNN repairing as a data augmentation problem, and design a novel augmentation-based repairing method, which to the best extent leverages limited failure cases.

The complex interaction between multiple entities widely exists in the network, which can reflect specific human behavior patterns. Such patterns can be modeled by higher-order network structures, thus benefiting anomaly detection on attributed networks. However, due to the lack of an effective mechanism in most existing graph learning methods, these complex interaction patterns fail to be applied in detecting anomalies, hindering the progress of anomaly detection to some extent. In order to address the aforementioned issue, we present a higher-order structure based anomaly detection (GUIDE) method. We exploit attribute autoencoder and structure autoencoder to reconstruct node attributes and higher-order structures, respectively. Moreover, we design a graph attention layer to evaluate the significance of neighbors to nodes through their higher-order structure differences. Finally, we leverage node attribute and higher-order structure reconstruction errors to find anomalies. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets (i.e., ACM, Citation, Cora, DBLP, and Pubmed) are implemented to verify the effectiveness of GUIDE.

The method is suitable for a real-time implementation. Data are acquired using a Vermon 3.0 MHz 32×32 element 2-D phased array and the experimental ultrasound scanner SARUS. Measurements are conducted on a carotid artery flow phantom from Danish Phantom Design, and 20 frames are acquired with a constant flow rate of 16.7±0.17 mL/s provided by a Shelley Medical Imaging Technologies CompuFlow 1000 system. The peak velocity magnitude in the vessel is found to be 52.3±8.1 m/s compared to an expected peak velocity of 53.6±0.54 cm/s.

The primary issue of preventing gastric cancer is to assess its risk level. Most of the current approaches merely contain histological and demographic information for cancer risk assessment. However, the factors of patient-based information, such as family history, diet, high-risk habits and exposure to environmental carcinogens are often not considered in cancer prediction. To address the issue, we present a fully connected neural network method with weighted neighborhood feature (WNF-FCNN) to improve the accuracy of gastric cancer risk prediction based on patient-based information. We first adopt two feature selection schemes to choose weighted neighborhood feature from the 121 raw medical attributes about gastric cancer. Then, a four-layer FCNN is constructed to model the risk level of gastric cancer with Adam optimization algorithm being used to speed up the convergence during training stages. Empirical evaluations on a real hospital cancer medical dataset containing 50,611 records demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach.

This allows for new opportunities to explore algorithms to interpret body sensor data and provide analytical feedback for learning a physical task, refining body motions, or to protect from work-related injuries. This paper presents a solution to non-invasively equip a person with sensors of a Smart Training System (STS) to improve training efficiency during sport activities. Our system calculates the significance of each body part during physical activities and provides targeted feedback on which body locations are under-performing. In experiments, the system collected data from 13 inertial sensors attached to the entire body of inexperienced golf learners. Using an indoor golf training net with a central target with 3 concentric zones, 1,080 real-world golf swings of 11 participants were analyzed. During the first 30 swings of each participant, the system learned distributions of motions from each sensor, conditioned on swing performance reported by users from their hitting location on the target. In the later 70 swings, feedback was provided to a subgroup of 8 participants, by computing, for an optimal set of features determined during training, the largest discrepancy. The remaining 3 (control) participants received no feedback. From only 100 golf swings for each participant, our system led to significantly improved scores by on average 3.7x (t-test, p <; 0.0001) over the latter 70 swings.

10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587406,Large margin pursuit for a Conic Section classifier,IEEE,Conferences,"Learning a discriminant becomes substantially more difficult when the datasets are high-dimensional and the available samples are few. This is often the case in computer vision and medical diagnosis applications. A novel conic section classifier (CSC) was recently introduced in the literature to handle such datasets, wherein each class was represented by a conic section parameterized by its focus, directrix and eccentricity. The discriminant boundary was the locus of all points that are equi-eccentric relative to each class-representative conic section. Simpler boundaries were preferred for the sake of generalizability. In this paper, we improve the performance of the two-class classifier via a large margin pursuit. When formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, the margin computation is demonstrated to be hard, especially due to the high dimensionality of the data. Instead, we present a geometric algorithm to compute the distance of a point to the non-linear discriminant boundary generated by the CSC in the input space. We then introduce a large margin pursuit in the learning phase so as to enhance the generalization capacity of the classifier. We validate the algorithm on real datasets and show favorable classification rates in comparison to many existing state-of-the-art binary classifiers as well as the CSC without margin pursuit.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4587406/,2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,23-28 June 2008,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874269,List-mode MLEM image reconstruction from 3D ML position estimates,IEEE,Conferences,"Current thick detectors used in medical imaging allow recording many attributes, such as the 3D location of interaction within the scintillation crystal and the amount of energy deposited. An efficient way of dealing with these data is by storing them in list-mode (LM). To reconstruct the data, maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) is efficiently applied to the list-mode data, resulting in the list-mode maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (LMMLEM) reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we consider a PET system consisting of two thick detectors facing each other. PMT outputs are collected for each coincidence event and are used to perform 3D maximum-likelihood (ML) position estimation of location of interaction. The mathematical properties of the ML estimation allow accurate modeling of the detector blur and provide a theoretical framework for the subsequent estimation step, namely the LMM-LEM reconstruction. Indeed, a rigorous statistical model for the detector output can be obtained from calibration data and used in the calculation of the conditional probability density functions for the interaction location estimates. Our implementation of the 3D ML position estimation takes advantage of graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware and permits accurate real-time estimates of position of interaction.

In this scenario it is important to note that several graph searching algorithms that were proposed to give exhaustive searches doesn't provide the most satisfying outcome in terms of asymptotic time complexity. Through this paper we intend to highlight the significance of machine learning as a useful tool that can be incorporated in various graph searching algorithms that can reduce its complexity.

10.1109/ICOSST53930.2021.9683838,MRI Based Glioma Detection and Classification into Low-grade and High-Grade Gliomas,IEEE,Conferences,"Brain tumors are one of the most rapidly spreading types of tumors known to humans. The worst and most dangerous type of tumor is a brain tumor. However, if diagnosed early, patients with brain tumors have a higher chance of survival acknowledgments to simple and inexpensive treatments. Expert radiologists, equipment, and biopsies are used in the traditional method of diagnosing a brain tumor. Machine learning has proved to deliver cutting-edge methods for early identification of brain tumors with better accuracies, avoiding costly diagnoses and unnecessary biopsies and assisting radiologists. Using a machine learning approach, this study proposes a technique for brain tumor classification and segmentation as HGG and LGG (High-Grade Glioma &#x0026; Low-Grade Glioma). One of the most inflexible and innovative challenges confronting artificial intelligence approaches is medical diagnostics utilizing image processing and machine learning. The project involves the preprocessing, edge detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of MRI brain images. The preprocessing is implemented by using median filter and canny edge detection is adapted in edge detection stage to inspect the best performing edge detector in terms of accuracy. Then, the MR image is segmented by K-means clustering technique. However, some of the important features are extracted including GLCM features for texture identification. Finally, in the classification phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers are used. After using these classifiers, we distinguished the tumors as HGG or LGG. To determine whether an MRI image of the brain has a tumor and to classify as HGG or LGG, a machine learning methodology is applied. The aim is to develop a system with better tumor detection from MRI images to be used as a tool in real time by employing machine learning approach. The proposed method is validated using the MATLAB environment on the available BRATS 2019 dataset. Then, to illustrate the performance of SVM and KNN classifiers, a confusion matrix is frequently used.

10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/SmartNets48225.2019.9069799,Modeling and Scheduling with DAG used for tasks in ME with OVP,IEEE,Conferences,"Several techniques have been proposed to adapt multimedia and telecommunication applications to resource constraints. These techniques are mostly implemented at the application layer and make simplistic assumptions about the system resources communication and they are often unconvinced to the co-design in embedded system SoC and MPSoC. Moreover, they often assume that the data codec video characteristics and their processing needs are stationary, which is not true in practice especially in hardware for the real target FPGA. In fact, data streams in codec video are highly dynamic and may also experience concept drift, thereby requiring continuous online adaptation of the throughput and quality to each processing task in video and frame. Hence, existing solutions for multimedia and telecommunication applications are often too conservative or too aggressive, especially in video codec. To address these limitations, complexity in video test, quality of frame, precision, send video with a fast time especially in medical applications, airport and military flight problems. we propose offline algorithm scheduling which minimize the execution time (i.e., troughput and output quality of video and frame) of medical and military applications under real time and resources constraints. Our algorithm scheduling uses offline and online reinforcement learning techniques. Moreover, our scheduler is able to detect concept drifts and to smoothly adapt the scheduling strategy (DAG algorithm). Our experiments realized on a chain of tasks modeling real-life streaming application demonstrate that our scheduler is able to learn the scheduling policy and to adapt it such that it minimizes the execution time and optimize the precision, quality of frame as the video codec characteristics are dynamically changing. The strategy of scheduling algorithm is to order the tasks in processor or different processors.

10.1109/ACITT.2019.8780078,Modern Hardware and Software Solution for Identification of Abnormal Neurological Movements of Patients with Essential Tremor,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the real physical movements, associated with tremor, which is very small rapid fluctuations that vary greatly in amplitude and frequency, reliable measurements of motion characteristics and the interpretation of the results of such measurements are important for the diagnosis of diseases. Increasing of amplitude and changing the frequency and form of oscillation in relation to the norm (frequency and amplitude of physiological tremor) are signs of disturbance of central and peripheral neural mechanisms of regulation of movements. Program analysis of these parameters is important for understanding the role of dysfunction of individual structures of the brain in the processes of motion management, and for the clinic in the aspects of early detection, more accurate diagnosis of motor disorders, the choice and correction of optimal treatment methods associated with the selection of effective therapy. The analysis of tremor forms has great importance in neurological practice, in particular, in the diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome. Computerized analysis methods are extremely accurate and effective in assessing the degree of tremor of patients. Mathematical modeling allows obtaining frequency characteristics, amplitude of oscillation, deviation from normal state, etc. Development of mathematical models and methods, means of identification greatly facilitate the work with patients; make it possible to assess the degree of disease with a single and objective side.

Consequently, it is necessary to adopt a regular screen to reduce brain damage and other complications. For one thing, the risk factors screened can be divided into 6 subsets: medical history, family history, fasting blood, lifestyle, physical characteristics, and demographic information. For another, the screen results can be categorized into 5 groups: normal carotid plaque, thickening, unstable plaque, and arterial stenosis. To address the above problems, Multi-View Multi-Label (MVML) learning provides a fundamental framework for handling such tasks, which treats the risk factors as multi-view data and the screen results as multi-label data. Besides, it is a challenging issue of how to effectively utilize view correlations and label correlations in MVML learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Multi-label Learning with Dual-Attention Networks (MML-DAN) for stroke screen, which can strike a balance between label-specific views and label correlations. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism aims to focus on the most pertinent information of the corresponding labels rather than using all available risk factors equally. Experiments on one real-world dataset of stroke screen demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MML-DAN for stroke screen prediction. To further validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of MML-DAN, extensive experiments on 5 benchmark MVML datasets show that MML-DAN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art MVML algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9313285/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),16-19 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268650,Multiclass Brain Tumor Classification Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Supervised Machine Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can be used as a non invasive medical diagnostic method when used in combination with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The significant captured data in HSI can be useful for classifying different types of brain tissues, since they gather reflectance values from different band widths below and beyond the visual spectrum. This allows ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to classify brain tissues such as tumors. Predicted results can be used to create visualizations and support neurosurgeons before injuring any tissue. This way neurosurgeons can be more precise, reducing any possible damages on healthy tissues. In this work, a proposal for the classification of in-vivo brain hyperspectral images using SVM and RF classifiers is presented. A total of four hyperspectral images from four different patients with glioblastoma grade IV (GBM) brain tumor have been selected to train models and, therefore, classify them. Five different classes have been defined during experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Results obtained suggest that SVM usually performs better than RF, generally achieving up to 97% of mean accuracy (ACC). However, RF performance had better results than SVM when classifying images used during training, obtaining almost 100% of mean ACC for all 5 classes described.

10.1109/CVPR.2014.352,Multivariate General Linear Models (MGLM) on Riemannian Manifolds with Applications to Statistical Analysis of Diffusion Weighted Images,IEEE,Conferences,"Linear regression is a parametric model which is ubiquitous in scientific analysis. The classical setup where the observations and responses, i.e., (xi, yi) pairs, are Euclidean is well studied. The setting where yi is manifold valued is a topic of much interest, motivated by applications in shape analysis, topic modeling, and medical imaging. Recent work gives strategies for max-margin classifiers, principal components analysis, and dictionary learning on certain types of manifolds. For parametric regression specifically, results within the last year provide mechanisms to regress one real-valued parameter, xi ∈ R, against a manifold-valued variable, yi ∈ M. We seek to substantially extend the operating range of such methods by deriving schemes for multivariate multiple linear regression -- a manifold-valued dependent variable against multiple independent variables, i.e., f: ℝn → M. Our variational algorithm efficiently solves for multiple geodesic bases on the manifold concurrently via gradient updates. This allows us to answer questions such as: what is the relationship of the measurement at voxel y to disease when conditioned on age and gender. We show applications to statistical analysis of diffusion weighted images, which give rise to regression tasks on the manifold GL(n)/O(n) for diffusion tensor images (DTI) and the Hilbert unit sphere for orientation distribution functions (ODF) from high angular resolution acquisition.

This is primarily due to the introduction of low-cost electroencephalographic (EEG) systems that render BCI technology accessible for non-medical research, but also due to the advancements of signal processing and machine learning methods. Consequently, BCI&#x2019;s can now provide a wide new range of possibilities in the way users interact with a computer system (e.g., neuroadaptive interfaces). However, major challenges must still be addressed for BCI systems to mature into an established communication medium for effective brain-computer interaction. One of the major challenges involves the easy integration of real-time processing pipelines with portable EEG systems for out-of-the-lab use. To date, despite the amount of options current open-source tools provide, most toolboxes focus mainly in extending the processing and classification methods but lack on the ability to provide an easy-to-design yet extensible architecture for ubiquitous use. Here, we present NeuXus, a modular Python toolbox for real-time biosignal processing and pipeline design. NeuXus is open-source and platform independent, providing high-level implementation of processing pipelines for easy BCI design and deployment, including for simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions through real-time gradient artifact correction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9842925/,2022 IEEE 21st Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference (MELECON),14-16 June 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Rapid HDL is introduced as a 15 minute rapid prototyping approach, where real-time implementations will be demoed on FPGAs. The spike-time dependent plasticity can support coding schemes that are based on spatio-temporal spike patterns. Spiking (or pulsed) neural networks (SNNs) are models which explicitly take into account the timing of inputs. The network input and output are usually represented as series of spikes (delta function or more complex shapes). Plasticity SNNs have an advantage of being able to recurrently process information. Spike-time dependent plasticity can enhance signal transmission by selectively strengthening synaptic connections that transmit precisely timed spikes at the expense of those synapses that transmit poorly timed spikes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5426668/,Proceedings of the IEEE 2009 National Aerospace & Electronics Conference (NAECON),21-23 July 2009,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Pathological diagnoses are sensitive to many external factors and is known to be subjective. Only systems that can meet strict requirements in pathology would be able to run along pathological routines and eventually digitized the area, and the developed platform should comply with existing pathological routines and international standards. Currently, there are a number of available software tools which can perform histopathological tasks including virtual slide viewing, annotating, and basic image analysis, however, none of them can serve as a digital platform for pathology.

Both infrared (IR) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging techniques have a variety of applications in these fields. For instance, satellite images are taken via IR or NIR spectrometer and laser Doppler medical scanning is collaborated with NIR spectrometer. Matrix functions of any image correspond to brightness or energy at each image pixel. The actual decision making must rely on detailed investigation of images being obtained. Therefore, image processing should be taken into account so as to enhance the results from real world. Segmentation is an image analysis approach to clarify feature ambiguity and information noise, which divides an image into separate parts that correlate with the objects or areas of the particular object involved. This procedure can be conducted by clustering, which is a process of partitioning a set of pattern vectors into subsets. Being a simple unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means clustering algorithm has the potential to both simplify the computation and accelerate the convergence. In most cases optimization is closely related to clustering, which gives rise to the best way of problem solving.

Inherent to the efficacy of deep brain stimulation is the acquisition of an optimal parameter configuration. Using conventional methods, the optimization process for tuning the deep brain stimulation system parameters can intrinsically induce strain on clinical resources. An advanced means of quantifying Parkinson's hand tremor and distinguishing between parameter settings would be highly beneficial. The conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system, such as the BioStamp nPoint, has a volumetric profile on the order of a bandage that readily enables convenient quantification of Parkinson's disease hand tremor. Furthermore, the BioStamp nPoint has been certified by the FDA as a 510(k) medical device for acquisition of medical grade data. Parametric variation of the amplitude parameter for deep brain stimulation can be quantified through the BioStamp nPoint conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system mounted to the dorsum of the hand. The acquired inertial sensor signal data can be wirelessly transmitted to a secure Cloud computing environment for post-processing. The quantified inertial sensor data for the parametric study of the effects of varying amplitude can be distinguished through machine learning classification. Software automation through Python can consolidate the inertial sensor data into a suitable feature set format. Using the multilayer perceptron neural network considerable machine learning classification accuracy is attained to distinguish multiple parametric settings of amplitude for deep brain stimulation, such as 4.0 mA, 2.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and `Off' status representing a baseline.

The system is implemented and simulated in Anaconda, and its performance is tested on real dataset that contains 22 features, with the total of 195 instances and two (02) classes. Each class, an abnormal class (patients having PD) and a normal class (healthy patients) consists of 48 instances, and 147 instances, respectively. The simulation results achieved better training accuracy, slightly higher than the test accuracy in the range of [75.7%~100%] and [75.0%~92.3%], respectively. The prediction performance of the class status maybe optimized by combining the dataset set size with the k-neighbors parameters. It can be improved by adjusting k and the size in the range of [2~9], and [15%~35%], which results in increasing the interval of the accuracy in the range of [86.7~100] % for the training set and [86.4~91,8] % for the test set. The proposed method shows the effectiveness of identifying a normal and an abnormal class status from the statistical proprieties of the Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals.

The method is validated by the proposed planar 3D res-u-net network with encoder transferred from the 2D VGG-16, which is applied for a single-stage unbalanced 3D image data segmentation. In particular, we evaluate the method on the MICCAI 2016 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset utilizing solely fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence without brain extraction for training and inference to simulate real medical praxis. The planar 3D res-u-net network performed the best both in sensitivity and Dice score amongst end to end methods processing raw MRI scans and achieved comparable Dice score to a state-of-the-art unimodal not end to end approach. Complete source code was released under the open-source license, and this paper complies with the Machine learning reproducibility checklist. By implementing practical transfer learning for 3D data representation, we could segment heavily unbalanced data without selective sampling and achieved more reliable results using less training data in a single modality. From a medical perspective, the unimodal approach gives an advantage in real praxis as it does not require co-registration nor additional scanning time during an examination.

While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details.

However, the deployment of HAR in real-world scenarios is limited by some major challenges. Among those issues, privacy is particularly relevant, since activity patterns may reveal sensitive information about the users (e.g., personal habits, medical conditions). HAR solutions based on Federated Learning (FL) have been recently proposed to mitigate this problem. In FL, each user shares with a cloud server only the parameters of a locally trained model, while personal data are kept private. The cloud server is in charge of building a global model by aggregating the received parameters. Even though FL avoids the release of labelled sensor data, researchers have found that the parameters of deep learning models may still reveal sensitive information through specifically designed attacks. In this paper, we propose a first contribution in this line of research by introducing a novel framework to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for FL-based HAR.

Recently, emergent specialists come to this conclusion that their traditional decision making process, in the situation of incomplete information, is not as accurate as they expected. This paper is aimed at developing intelligent software to take a precise decision, even in the situation of facing with uncertainty and incomplete data. In this way, a fuzzy rule-based classifier system (FRBCS) capable of working with various types of input (hybrid inputs), even in the situation of facing with missing features, is proposed and compared to the conventional machine learning algorithms. In order to exhibit effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a data set is collected with the help of “Management and Medical Emergency Center of Fars Province” containing 227 subjects with heart attack. Recorded attributes for each subject includes 33 boolean, 4 real value, and 2 nominal features (totally 39 hybrid attributes) belong to 16 essential prehospital care order.

10.1109/ICMLA.2015.196,Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Belief Networks for Prognosis of Breast Cancer,IEEE,Conferences,"We propose a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) for prognosis and diagnosis of breast cancer. PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes. Extensive experiments using real-world databases, such as METABRIC and NKI, show promising results in comparison to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers, for classifying tumors and predicting events like recurrence and metastasis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7424407/,2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),9-11 Dec. 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents the design and implementation of PyGuard, a novel software prototype to find and understand real-world security vulnerabilities in the CPython virtual machines. With PyGuard, we carried out an empirical study of 10 different versions of CPython virtual machines (from version 3.0 to the latest 3.9). By scanning a total of 3,358,391 lines native code, we have identified 598 new vulnerabilities. Based on our study, we describe a taxonomy to classify vulnerabilities in CPython virtual machines.

10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.172,Querying Large and Expressive Biomedical Ontologies,IEEE,Conferences,"Real-world biomedical ontologies like the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) are often of large size and can fall in the category of OWL 2 Full. Meta-modeling is commonly adopted in the FMA with most of its classes and roles also specified as individuals, leading to undecidability in reasoning. The state-of-the-art reasoning and querying systems like Pellet often ignore the essence of such meta-modeling. In this paper we present a novel, effective approach to querying large and expressive medical ontologies. More precisely, a sub-language of OWL 2 Full is defined, denoted as Hi(SRIQ), to extend the DL language SRIQ with meta-modeling so that one name can be used as class, role and individual at the same time. We give an algorithm to construct multiple SRIQ knowledge bases from a Hi(SRIQ) ontology so that its reasoning and querying tasks can be reduced to be performed in these SRIQs in an independent way. Moreover, a meta-query language is designed to allow for variables present at class/role positions in query. Answering meta-query in constructed SRIQs is transformed into evaluating a group of conjunctive queries over single SRIQ through query partitioning and heuristic materialization of class/role variables in query. As a result, the Hi(SRIQ) version of the FMA yields eight SRIQs and an empirical study shows that our approach outperforms Pellet in query answering. Our work demonstrates that through divide-and-conquer large and expressive ontologies can be queried in both sound and practical way.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7336206/,"2015 IEEE 17th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2015 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security, and 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems",24-26 Aug. 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

On-line Holter monitors need reliable and quick algorithms to perform all the necessary signal processing tasks. This paper presents the methods that were conceptualized and implemented at the development of such a monitoring system at Medical Clinic No. 4 of Targu-Mures. The system performs the following ECG signal processing steps: (1) Decomposition of the ECG signals using multi-resolution wavelet transform, which also eliminates most of the high and low frequency noises. These components will serve as input for wave classification algorithms; (2) Identification of QRS complexes, P and T waves using two different algorithms: a sequential clustering and a neural-network-based classification. This latter also distinguishes normal R waves from abnormal cases; (3) Localization of several kinds of arrhythmia using a spectral method. An autoregressive model is applied to estimate the series of R-R intervals. The coefficients of the AR model are predicted using the Kalman filter, and these coefficients will determine a local spectrum for each QRS complex. By analyzing this spectrum, different arrhythmia cases are identified. The algorithms were tested using the MIT-BIH signal database and own multichannel ECG registrations.

Research is also ongoing into how to improve the lives of ordinary citizens using robotic arms. Often, it is difficult for physically impaired individuals to complete tasks such as obtaining an object from a shelf, opening a refrigerator door, obtaining food or drink from the refrigerator, and picking a needed item from a drawer. Thus, they must rely on a caregiver to aid them with such tasks or complete these tasks for them. In such cases, a robotic arm could potentially be used to assist the visually impaired individual to pick up items. Prior work has described a system that takes in audio commands from an individual, applies natural language processing to identify the action required by the user, and combines this with object recognition and grasp detection to identify the object in the fridge. However, the limitation in that work was the different components were not integrated and there were inefficiencies in the process of grasp point detection from images.This work builds on existing research by integrating the object recognition and grasp detection components. The work describes a technique to dynamically adjust the size of the object image sent to the grasp point detection module by extracting only the portion necessary for grasp detection from the stream of camera images. This approach of separately performing the object recognition, identifying the portion of the object suitable for grasping (i.e., the handle), and dynamically determining the buffer zone around the handle for use in the grasp detection module reduces the amount of data transmitted between steps and enables real-time object recognition and grasp identification.

Therefore, robot-assisted colonoscopy is considered as an important method to solve this problem. In recent years, many automated deep learning models for colonoscopy have been proposed. However, these models are usually large and time-consuming, and cannot meet actual needs. Besides, due to the disconnection of data between hospitals, the strength of medical resources between different departments in different hospitals is different, so the general multi-classification model cannot fit the characteristics of such data distribution. Therefore, in this article, we ensemble multiple binary classification models (each model detects one disease) and extracted a compression model using knowledge distillation technology, which can simultaneously detect polyps, Merkel diverticula, ulcers and bleeding from colonoscopy.

The acquired ECG time series (TS) signals are often manually evaluated by qualified medical doctors in order to discover any arrhythmia that the patient may have experienced. Much effort has been put into automatizing the process of evaluating ECG readings to learn the various forms of arrhythmia.

In this paper, we propose a robustness definition for neural networks used for regression, by tackling some of the problems of existing robustness definitions. First of all, by following recent works done for classification problems, we propose to define the robustness of networks used for regression w.r.t. alterations of their input data that can happen in reality. Since different alteration levels are not always equally probable, the robustness definition is parameterized with the probability distribution of the alterations. The error done by this type of networks is quantifiable as the difference between the estimated value and the expected value; since not all the errors are equally critical, the robustness definition is also parameterized with a &#x201C;tolerance&#x201D; function that specifies how the error is tolerated. The current work has been motivated by the collaboration with the industrial partner that has implemented a medical sensor employing a Multilayer Perceptron for the estimation of the blood oxygen pressure.

These Trojans lead to un-desired change in functionality of the design and provide easy access to sensitive information. Trojans attacks or malicious activities are triggered based on very rare conditions, which can evade test-time Trojan detection but can arise during long hours of field operation. In this paper we propose a run-time Trojan detection architecture for a custom many-core based on Machine Learning technique. We exploit Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised machine learning algorithms. The Data-set is generated based on many-core router behavior under normal and Trojan triggered settings. The paper targets different communication attacks triggered by Hardware Trojans, namely core address spoofing, traffic diversion, route looping attack. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has detection accuracy in the range of 94% to 97%.We implemented a framework for many-core architecture with SVM kernel while triggering Trojans based on two different conditions. To demonstrate the performance of proposed security framework, we implement a bio-medical seizure detection application as a case study. The algorithm is mapped on 64 processing cores and it takes 2.1µS to execute whereas with the proposed security framework it requires 4.8µS execution time.

10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108484,Spectral feature extraction and characterization via simple linear and nonlinear technology integration,IEEE,Conferences,"A systematic approach for spectral calibration, extraction and characterization is presented. It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108484/,2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI),21-22 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Early prediction of hypotensive events in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) allows clinicians to pre-emptively treat the patient and avoid possible organ damage. In this study, we investigate the performance of various supervised machine-learning classification algorithms along with a real-time labeling technique to predict acute hypotensive events in the ICU. It is shown that logistic regression and SVM yield a better combination of specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Logistic regression is able to predict 85% of events within 30 minutes of their onset with 81% PPV and 96% specificity, while SVM results in 96% specificity, 83% sensitivity and 82% PPV.

So far, automated Computer-Aided Diagnostic tools were not widely applied to ultrasound imaging. The emerging methods in Artificial Intelligence, namely deep learning, gave rise to new applications in medical imaging modalities. The work's objective was to show the feasibility of implementing deep learning algorithms directly on a research scanner with GPU software beamforming. We have implemented and evaluated two deep neural network architectures as part of the signal processing pipeline on the ultrasound research platform USPlatform (us4us Ltd., Poland). The USPlatform is equipped with a GPU cluster, enabling full software-based channel data processing as well as the integration of open source Deep Learning frameworks. The first neural model (S-4-2) is a classical convolutional network for one-class classification of baby body parts. We propose a simple 6-layer network for this task. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 786 ultrasound images of a fetal training phantom. The second model (Gu-net) is a fully convolutional neural network for brachial plexus localisation. The model uses `U-net'-like architecture to compute the overall probability of target detection and the probability mask of possible target locations. The model was trained and evaluated on 5640 ultrasound B-mode frames. Both training and inference were performed on a multi-GPU (Nvidia Titan X) cluster integrated with the platform. As performance metrics we used: accuracy as a percentage of correct answers in classification, dice coefficient for object detection, and mean and std. dev. of a model's response time. The `S-4-2' model achieved 96% classification accuracy and a response time of 3 ms (334 predictions/s). This simple model makes accurate predictions in a short time. The `Gu-net' model achieved a 0.64 dice coefficient for object detection and a 76% target's presence classification accuracy with a response time of 15 ms (65 predictions/s).

Distributed Databases represents a software system that allows a multitude of applications to access the data stored in local or remote databases. In this scenario, the data distribution is achieved through the process of replication. Nowadays many solutions for storing the data are available: relational distributed Database Management Systems (DBMS), NoSQL storing solutions, NewSQL storing solutions, graph oriented databases, object oriented databases, object-relational databases, etc. The present study analyzes the most commonly used storing solution: the relational model. The replication topology used in the related experiments was the classical publisher-subscriber topology. The distribution of data is made from the publisher system. The present work studies the interaction between the most suited distributed data mining architecture (Distributed Committee Machines) for mining distributed data and real relational distributed databases. The chosen Data Mining task is the classification one. Distributed Committee Machines are a group of neuronal networks working in a distributed procedure to obtain an improved classification performance compared to a single neural structure. In these experiments we used the classical multilayer perceptron trained with the backpropagation algorithm.

Although there have been studies on diversity and its links to overall ensemble accuracy, little work has been done on the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures in class imbalance learning. The study of class imbalance learning is important, because many real-world problems, such as those in medical diagnosis, fraud detection, condition monitoring, etc., have imbalanced classes, where a minority class is usually more important and interesting than the majority class. In order to gain a deeper understanding of ensemble learning for imbalanced classes, this paper studies the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures theoretically and empirically.

10.1109/IoTDI54339.2022.00015,To Share or Not to Share: On Location Privacy in IoT Sensor Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Data sharing is crucial for building large datasets which in return are essential for developing and training accurate models in many contexts including smart cities, agriculture, and medical applications. However, shared data may leak private information, such as personal identifiers or location. Past research provides evidence that solely removing these identifiers through pseudonymization is not enough to ensure data privacy protection, since even the pseudonymized data may still contain information about the data provider. In this paper, we show that sensor data may leak a sensor&#x0027;s location even if the latter is not explicitly shared. Sensors are localized by linking sensor data with publicly available environmental data such as local weather. The proposed localization method relies on a machine learning model to predict weather data from sensor observations. Subsequently, the localization algorithm determines the sensor&#x0027;s location from the predicted weather trace using Bayesian filtering. We apply our approach to three real-world datasets where we (1) localize an ozone sensor given its readings, (2) localize a cow from activity parameters recorded with a tracker in the cow&#x0027;s reticulum, (3) localize solar panels based on their solar generation data. The achieved average localization accuracy of 5.68 km, 19.91 km, and 13.68 km on the above tasks, respectively, using data traces with a length of 365 days is remarkable. In addition, we introduce a mechanism, referred to as teleport, to protect location information in sensor data.

A pulsed Doppler gate was placed within the lumen of the vessel in the flow system, then the SHAPE algorithm was initiated (ftransmit: 5.6 MHz; chirp down transmit pulse; pulse inversion mode). The algorithm steps through all the available IAO levels, extracting and processing the subharmonic amplitude in real-time. The IAO level associated with the maximum derivative of the subharmonic amplitude is then chosen as the optimum IAO level. Simultaneous catheter pressure and subharmonic data were acquired at, below and above the optimum IAO level (10 secs; n = 3). Linear correlation between the subharmonic and catheter data was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). At the optimum IAO level the correlation coefficient between SHAPE and the pressure catheter data ranged between -0.6 and -0.9; for the IAO immediately below and above the optimum IAO, ranges were -0.4 to -0.8, and -0.6 to -0.8, respectively. In conclusion, optimum IAO level determination for insonating microbubbles to be utilized for SHAPE has been demonstrated; this will assist in real-time clinical applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8092364/,2017 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),6-9 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets.

However, the anisotropy in most ssEM data makes it difficult to directly adopt such learning-based methods for the registration of these images. Here, we propose a novel deformable image registration approach based on weakly supervised learning that can be applied to registering ssEM images at scale. The proposed method leverages slice interpolation to improve registration between images with sudden and large structural changes.

Different intelligent application scenarios can benefit from these computer-based systems that predict the ages of people correctly. Automatic apparent age system is particularly useful in medical diagnosis, facial beauty product development, movie role casting, the effect of plastic surgery, and anti-aging treatment. Predicting the real and apparent age of people has been quite difficult for both machines and humans. More recently, Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods have been extensively used for these classification task. It has incomparable advantages in extracting discriminative image features from human faces. However, many of the existing CNN-based methods are designed to be deeper and larger with more complex layers that makes it challenging to deploy on mobile devices with resource-constrained features. Therefore, we design a lightweight CNN model of fewer layers to estimate the real and apparent age of individuals from unconstrained real-time face images that can be deployed on mobile devices.

Stroke diseases can be divided into ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, and they should be minimized by emergency treatment such as thrombolytic or coagulant administration by type. First, it is essential to detect in real time the precursor symptoms of stroke, which occur differently for each individual, and to provide professional treatment by a medical institution within the proper treatment window. However, prior studies have focused on developing acute treatment or clinical treatment guidelines after the onset of stroke rather than detecting the prognostic symptoms of stroke. In particular, in recent studies, image analysis such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) has mostly been used to detect and predict prognostic symptoms in stroke patients. Not only are these methodologies difficult to diagnose early in real-time, but they also have limitations in terms of a long test time and a high cost of testing. In this paper, we propose a system that can predict and semantically interpret stroke prognostic symptoms based on machine learning using the multi-modal bio-signals of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) measured in real-time for the elderly. To predict stroke disease in real-time while walking, we designed and implemented a stroke disease prediction system with an ensemble structure that combines CNN and LSTM. The proposed system considers the convenience of wearing the bio-signal sensors for the elderly, and the bio-signals were collected at a sampling rate of 1,000Hz per second from the three electrodes of the ECG and the index finger for PPG while walking.

10.1109/JIOT.2021.3100068,ASTCN: An Attentive Spatial–Temporal Convolutional Network for Flow Prediction,IEEE,Journals,"Flow prediction attracts intensive research interests, since it can offer essential support to many crucial problems in public safety and smart city, e.g., epidemic spread prediction and medical resource allocation optimization. Among all the models in flow prediction, deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks) are popular and outperform other statistics and machine learning models, since they can learn intrinsic structures and extract features from spatial–temporal (ST) data. However, most of them set strict temporal periods in the prediction or separate the interaction between spatial and temporal correlations. Therefore, the prediction accuracy is affected. To overcome the difficulties, we propose a flow prediction network attentive spatial–temporal convolutional network (ASTCN), which can effectively handle large-scale flow data and learn complex features. In ASTCN, we leverage an attention mechanism to overcome the previous problem of strict temporal periods, and can effectively fuse ST data with multiple factors from different time-series sources. Furthermore, we propose a causal 3-D convolutional layer based on temporal convolutional networks (TCNs). It can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to improve the prediction accuracy. We comprehensively conducted our experiments based on real-world data sets. Experimental results show that ASTCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 3.78% in root mean square error.

To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive weighting and scalable distance regularized level set evolution (AW-SDRLSE) method for delineating lymphoma boundaries on 2D PET slices. There are three important characteristics with respect to AW-SDRLSE: 1) A scalable distance regularization term is proposed and a parameter $q$ can control the contour's convergence rate and precision in theory. 2) A novel dynamic annular mask is proposed to calculate mean intensities of local interior and exterior regions and further define the region energy term. 3) As the level set method is sensitive to parameters, we thus propose an adaptive weighting strategy for the length and area energy terms using local region intensity and boundary direction information. AW-SDRLSE is evaluated on 90 cases of real PET data with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8796. Comparative results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of AW-SDRLSE as well as its performance advantages as compared with related level set methods. In addition, experimental results indicate that AW-SDRLSE can be a fine segmentation method for improving the lymphoma segmentation results obtained by deep learning (DL) methods significantly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9177037/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,April 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Various studies have developed automatic critical fall detection systems for emergency alarms and medical services. Window sizes and segmentation approaches would affect the system performance in terms of power consumption, computational speed and reliability that are essential considerations in the real-world implementation. Intuitively, employing shorter window sizes and simpler segmentation approaches leads to a faster detection speed and better power efficiency. However, few works explore the effects of windowing methods on detection performance, especially for machine learning models. This paper investigates the impact of segmentation approaches and window sizes in wearable-based critical fall detection systems with machine learning models. Two generally used segmentation approaches, including sliding windows and impact-defined windows, are explored with a range of window sizes from 0.5 s to 5.0 s and four machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Naïve Bayes (NB). The results show that sliding windows are more sensitive to the changes of window sizes compared to impact-defined windows. However, the differences between the best performance of both segmentation approaches are within 1% (99.66% in sliding windows and 99.78% in impact-defined windows). For systems with SVM and k-NN models, using 0.5 s window sizes in sliding windows and combinations of 1.5 s backward and forward windows in impact-defined windows are sufficient to achieve at least 94% accuracy and 98% accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8910560/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"15 March15, 2020",ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Application of these methods to medical signals and images can help caregivers form proper decision-making. One of the important IoMT medical application areas includes aggressive driving behaviors to mitigate road incidents and crashes. Various IoMT-enabled body sensors or camera sensors can be utilized for real-time monitoring and detection of drivers' bio-signal status such as heart rate, blood pressure, and drivers' behaviors. However, it requires a lightweight detection module and a powerful training module with real-time storing and analysis of drivers' behaviors data from these medical devices to detect driving behaviors and provides instant feedback by the administrator for safety, gas emissions, and energy/fuel consumption. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a bio-signal-based system for real-time detection of aggressive driving behaviors using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model with edge and cloud technologies. More precisely, the system consists of three modules, which are the driving behaviors detection module implemented on edge devices in the vehicle, the training module implemented in the cloud platform, and the analyzing module placed in the monitoring environment connected with a telecommunication network. The DCNN model of the proposed system is evaluated using a holdout test set of 30% on two different processed bio-signal datasets. These two processed bio-signal datasets are generated from our collected bio-signal dataset by using two different time windows and two different time steps. The experimental results show that the proposed DCNN model achieves 73.02% of validation accuracy on the processed dataset 1 and 79.15% of validation accuracy on the processed dataset 2.

It is relatively easier to segment prostate from MR images than from CT images, due to better soft tissue contrast of the MR images. For segmenting prostate from CT images, most previous methods mainly used CT alone, and thus their performances are often limited by low tissue contrast in the CT images. In this article, we explore the possibility of using indirect guidance from MR images for improving prostate segmentation in the CT images. In particular, we propose a novel deep transfer learning approach, i.e., MR-guided CT network training (namely MICS-NET), which can employ MR images to help better learning of features in CT images for prostate segmentation. In MICS-NET, the guidance from MRI consists of two steps: (1) learning informative and transferable features from MRI and then transferring them to CT images in a cascade manner, and (2) adaptively transferring the prostate likelihood of MRI model (i.e., well-trained convnet by purely using MR images) with a view consistency constraint. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate MICS-NET on a real CT prostate image set, with the manual delineations available as the ground truth for evaluation. Our methods generate promising segmentation results which achieve (1) six percentages higher Dice Ratio than the CT model purely using CT images and (2) comparable performance with the MRI model purely using MR images.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8933421/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Aug. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most existing neural network circuit designs, however, are based on generic frameworks that are not optimized for memristors. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing efficient memristor-based implementations of complex neural network operators, such as deconvolutions and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, which are critical for achieving high accuracy in common medical image analysis applications, such as semantic segmentation. This article proposes convolution-kernel first (CKF), an efficient scheme for designing memristor-based fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs). Compared with existing neural network circuits, CKF enables effective parameter pruning, which significantly reduces circuit power consumption. Furthermore, CKF includes the novel, memristor-optimized implementations of deconvolution layers and SE blocks. Simulation results on real medical image segmentation tasks confirm that CKF obtains up to 56.2&#x0025; reduction in terms of computations and 33.62-W reduction in terms of power consumption in the circuit after weight pruning while retaining high accuracy on the test set.

Conventional ways to detect large-area brain activity using near-infrared (NIR) technology are based on Time-division or Frequency-division modulation technique, which traverses all physical sensory channels in a specific period. To achieve higher imaging resolution or brain-tasks classification accuracy, the NIRS system require higher density and more channels, which conflict with the limited battery capacity. Inspired by the functional atlas of the human brain, this paper proposes a spatial adaptive sampling (SAS) method. It can change the active channel pattern of the fNIRS system to match with the real-time brain activity, to increase the energy efficiency without significant reduction on the brain imaging quality or the accuracy of brain activity classification. Therefore, the number of the averaging enabled channels will be dramatically reduced in practice. To verify the proposed SAS technique, a wearable and flexible NIRS system has been implemented, in which each channel of light-emitting diode (LED) drive circuits and photodiode (PD) detection circuits can be power gated independently. Brain task experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed method, the power consumption of the LED drive module is reduced by 46.58&#x0025; compared to that without SAS technology while maintaining an average brain imaging PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) of 35 dB.

The complete process consists of noise filtering, fluorescence identification, optimization and elimination, spectral normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, and data clustering, as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling, intelligent control, and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as system identification, a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated, which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples. Raman spectra are weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, which have to be reduced to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic has been known to interpret uncertainty, imprecision, and vague phenomena. Thus, a fuzzy controller is used for noise filtering. On the other hand, background fluorescence acts as a secondary intensity component within a raw Raman spectrograph, so its spectral baseline should be determined. By removing background fluorescence, intrinsic Raman spectrum can be extracted in consequence. To optimize this detrend process, genetic algorithms have been implemented for baseline-function global optimization by selecting an optimal combination of individual spectroscopic functions. Normalization is performed by standard normal variate (SNV) afterwards to compensate for scattering effects. Normalized intrinsic spectra can be used for sample differentiation, where the PCA approach distinguishes some signatures from different samples in terms of dominant principal components. Eventually, various principal components are accumulated for clustering using scatter plots. The long-term objective of this intelligent-control approach is to create a real-time technique for sample analysis, using a Raman spectrometer directly mounted at the end-effectors of medical robots, which is to enhance the robotic surgery.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381368/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Jan. 2005,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Emotion classifiers have historically used software on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions. Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely, Emotiv Epoc+, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by BioCNN. For training and testing, BioCNN uses three repositories of emotion classification datasets, including the publicly available DEAP and DREAMER datasets, along with an original dataset collected in-house from 5 healthy subjects using standard visual stimuli. A subject-specific training approach is used under TensorFlow to train BioCNN, which is implemented using the Digilent Atlys Board with a low-cost Spartan-6 FPGA. The experimental results show a competitive energy efficiency of 11 GOps/W, a throughput of 1.65 GOps that is in line with the real-time specification of a wearable device, and a latency of less than 1 ms, which is smaller than the 150 ms required for human interaction times.

The non-constant rotation speed of optical components in the OCT catheter tip causes rotational distortion in OCT volumetric scanning. By improving the scanning process, this instability can be partially reduced. To further correct the rotational distortion in the OCT image, a volumetric data stabilization algorithm is proposed. The algorithm first estimates the Non-Uniform Rotational Distortion (NURD) for each B-scan by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A correlation map between two successive B-scans is computed and provided as input to the CNN. To solve the problem of accumulative error in iterative frame stream processing, we deploy an overall rotation estimation between reference orientation and actual OCT image orientation. We train the network with synthetic OCT videos by intentionally adding rotational distortion into real OCT images. As part of this article we discuss the proposed method in two different scanning modes: the first is a conventional pullback mode where the optical components move along the protection sheath, and the second is a self-designed scanning mode where the catheter is globally translated by using an external actuator.

For example, additive kernels work extremely well for some specific tasks, such as computer vision classification, medical research, and some specialized scenarios. Moreover, the analytical solution using AK-LS-SVM can formulate leave-one-out cross-validation error estimates in a closed form for parameter tuning, which drastically reduces the computational cost and guarantee the generalization performance especially on small and medium datasets. However, AK-LS-SVM still faces two main challenges: 1) improving the classification performance of AK-LS-SVM and 2) saving time when performing a grid search for model selection. Inspired by the stacked generalization principle and the transfer learning mechanism, a layer-by-layer combination of AK-LS-SVM classifiers embedded with transfer learning is proposed in this paper. This new classifier is called deep transfer additive kernel least square support vector machine (DTA-LS-SVM) which overcomes these two challenges. Also, considering that imbalanced datasets are involved in many real-world scenarios, especially for medical data analysis, the deep-transfer element is extended to compensate for this imbalance, thus leading to the development of another new classifier iDTA-LS-SVM. In the hierarchical structure of both DTA-LS-SVM and iDTA-LS-SVM, each layer has an AK-LS-SVM and the predictions from the previous layer act as an additional input feature for the current layer. Importantly, transfer learning is also embedded to guarantee generalization consistency between the adjacent layers.

After the 2011 historic milestone of defeating the two best human players in the Jeopardy! game show, the technology behind IBM Watson, DeepQA, is undergoing gamification into real-world business problems. Gamifying a business domain for Watson is a composite of functional, content, and training adaptation for nongame play. During domain gamification for medical, financial, government, or any other business, each system change affects the machine-learning process. As opposed to the original Watson Jeopardy!, whose class distribution of positive-to-negative labels is 1:100, in adaptation the computed training instances, question-and-answer pairs transformed into true-false labels, result in a very low positive-to-negative ratio of 1:100 000.

Conversational data from social media contain a considerable amount of useful information, and such data are the foundation for researching dynamic and artificial emotion. At present, most human–machine interaction systems focus on the complexity and accuracy of the dialog but neglect the emotional characteristics of the speaker. When generating a dialog considering the emotional personality of the interlocutor, controlling, and guiding the dialog to a specified direction are essential. This article presents a system for studying dynamic emotions in human-computer interaction from the perspective of emotional transfer and guidance. Based on the emotional state of the interlocutor and the distribution of emotional transfer, the process of emotional transfer is simulated and sampled, and the sequence of emotional guidance is generated. In this system, two algorithms are proposed. A generative Markov chain Monte Carlo (GEN-MCMC) algorithm is proposed to generate a variety of emotional transfer sequences that fit the talke’s personality dynamically based on the real-world dialog. Further, a guiding MCMC (GUI-MCMC) algorithm-based GEN-MCMC is proposed to generate the emotional guiding sequences. The generated emotional sequences by GEN-MCMC were evaluated in two aspects: 1) consistency and 2) diversity. The experimental results show that the GEN-MCMC algorithm performs better than the general sequence generation algorithm in terms of consistency and diversity in generating emotional states. The GUI-MCMC was able to generate a proper stimulus sequence when given the first and target emotions. An emotional stimulus sequence can simulate the emotional transfer of the interlocutor in the process of dialogue, and give the observer appropriate reference to guide and control the emotions of dialogue. The experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively model the dynamic emotion in emotional transfer and guidance, which can be further used to build chat robots, intelligent assistants, and human–machine interaction systems. The models can also be used for emotional induction and enhance the feel-good or feel-terrible factor in human–machine communication applications, such as medical treatment of mental diseases, interrogation, and psychological attack and defense.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943333/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This implies the need for convenient solutions to simplify screening and diagnosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of a novel wireless system in detecting breathing and snoring episodes during sleep. Methods: A wireless acoustic sensor was elaborated and implemented. Segmentation (based on spectral thresholding and heuristics) and classification of all breathing episodes during recording were implemented through a mobile application. The system was evaluated on 1520 manually labeled episodes registered from 40 real-world, whole-night recordings of 16 generally healthy subjects.

In medical ultrasound imaging, the structures that need to be detected appear as a collection of microstructures correlated along a path. In this paper, we investigated techniques that extract meaningful low-level information for curvilinear structures, using techniques based on structure tensor. We proposed a novel structure tensor enhancement inspired by bilateral filtering. We compared the proposed approach with five state-of-the-art curvilinear structure detectors. We tested the algorithms against simulated images with known ground truth and real images from three different domains (medical ultrasound, scanning electron microscope, and astronomy). For the real images, we employed experts to delineate the ground truth for each domain. Techniques borrowed from machine learning robustly assessed the performance of the methods (area under curve and cross validation). As a practical application, we used the proposed method to label a set of 5000 ultrasound images. We conclude that the proposed tensor-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in providing magnitude and orientation information for curvilinear structures. The evaluation methodology ensures that the employed feature-detection method will yield reproducible performance on new, unseen images.

It is typically associated with the decrease in visual acuity. Given its wide prevalence, there is an unmet need for the development of new tools that can diagnose the disease at an early stage in order to prevent disease progression and vision loss. The aim of this study is to develop and test a machine learning algorithm that can detect keratoconus at early stages. We applied several machine learning algorithms to detect keratoconus and then tested the algorithms using real world medical data, including corneal topography, elevation, and pachymetry parameters collected from OCT-based topography instruments from several corneal clinics in Japan. We implemented 25 different machine learning models in Matlab and achieved a range of 62% to 94.0% accuracy. The highest accuracy level of 94% was obtained by a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm using a subset of eight corneal parameters with the highest discriminating power. The proposed model may aid physicians in assessing corneal status and detecting keratoconus, which is otherwise challenging through subjective evaluations, particularly at the preclinical and early stages of the disease.

However, existing machine learning-based solutions heavily rely on abundant manually labeled EMR training data to ensure satisfactory prediction results, impeding their performance in the existence of rare diseases that are subject to severe data scarcity. For each rare disease, the limited EMR data can hardly offer sufficient information for a model to correctly distinguish its identity from other diseases with similar clinical symptoms. Furthermore, most existing disease prediction approaches are based on the sequential EMRs collected for every patient and are unable to handle new patients without historical EMRs, reducing their real-life practicality. In this paper, we introduce an innovative model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for disease prediction, which utilizes external knowledge bases to augment the insufficient EMR data, and learns highly representative node embeddings for patients, diseases and symptoms from the medical concept graph and patient record graph respectively constructed from the medical knowledge base and EMRs. By aggregating information from directly connected neighbor nodes, the proposed neural graph encoder can effectively generate embeddings that capture knowledge from both data sources, and is able to inductively infer the embeddings for a new patient based on the symptoms reported in her/his EMRs to allow for accurate prediction on both general diseases and rare diseases.

Furthermore, the use of biometrics enables secure access to private medical data, now collected in wearable devices such as smartwatches. In this work, we present an accurate low-power device authentication system that employs electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as the biometric modality. The proposed ECG processor consists of front-end signal processing of ECG signals and back-end neural networks (NNs) for accurate authentication. The NNs are trained using a cost function that minimizes intra-individual distance over time and maximizes inter-individual distance.

Nowadays, numerous deep learning algorithms have been proposed to predict seizure onset and obtain better performance than traditional machine learning methods. However, these methods require a large set of parameters and large hardware resources; they also have high energy consumption. Therefore, these methods cannot be implemented on compact, low-power wearable, or implantable medical devices. The devices should operate on a real-time basis to continually inform the epileptic patients. In this paper, we describe energy-efficient and hardware-friendly methods to predict the epileptic seizures.

However, their superior performance relies on correctly annotated large-scale datasets. It is very expensive and time-consuming to get the annotated large-scale datasets, especially in the medical field. While collecting a large amount of data is relatively easy, given the amount of data available on the web, but these data are highly unreliable, and they often include a massive amount of noisy labels. The past research works have shown that these noisy labels could significantly affect the performance of the deep convolutional neural networks on image classification. However, training a robust deep convolutional neural network with extremely noisy labels is a very challenging task. Inspired by the co-teaching concept, this paper proposes a novel method for training a robust convolutional neural network with extremely noisy labels, which is called group-teaching. Specifically, we train a group of convolutional neural networks simultaneously, and let them teach each other by selecting possibly clean samples for each network in each mini-batch. Each network back propagates the samples selected by other networks except itself and then it updates itself. The empirical results on noisy versions of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the robustness for noisy labels. Particularly, to verify the efficacy of our group-teaching in real-world noisy labels distribution, we have also validated the effectiveness of our method on the real-world noisy WebVision1000-100 dataset.

In recent years, some popular methods based on deep learning have been used for text classification, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. However, some problems are still encountered when classifying Chinese text. For example, important but obscure context information in Chinese text is not easily extracted.

However, the majority of these robots are overly complex, and require teleoperation via either a skilled operator or a specialised device, and often the operator must be present at the scene to navigate safely around the casualty. Instead, improving the autonomy of such robots can reduce the reliance on expert operators and potentially unstable communication systems, while still extracting the casualty in a safe manner. There are several stages in the casualty extraction procedure, from navigating to the location of the emergency, safely approaching and loading the casualty, to finally navigating back to the medical assistance location. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Decomposed-Objective based Model Predictive Control (HiDO-MPC) method for safely approaching and manoeuvring around the casualty. We implement this controller on ResQbot — a proof-of-concept mobile rescue robot we previously developed — capable of safely rescuing an injured person lying on the ground, i.e. performing the casualty extraction procedure. HiDO-MPC achieves the desired casualty extraction behaviour by decomposing the main objective into multiple sub-objectives with a hierarchical structure. At every time step, the controller evaluates this hierarchical decomposed objective and generates the optimal control decision. We have conducted a number of experiments both in simulation and using the real robot to evaluate the proposed method’s performance, and compare it with baseline approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy gives significantly better results than baseline approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and execution time, when applied to casualty extraction scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369351/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The technologies introduced in this paper are based on two key methods for real-time transformation of the photographic-quality Reinhard tone-mapping operator on emerging appliances, without compromising its quality. The first allows computing convolutions “selectively,” yielding faster computation than state-of-the-art convolution techniques while requiring a significantly lower memory footprint. The second utilizes machine learning to decrease the number of required convolutions per pixel. Both methods allow for scalable parallel implementation on commodity multicore processors and embedded processors.

The inverse tone-mapping operation is equally important for rendering legacy content on new HDR displays. We used the underlying tone-mapping operator to perform inverse tone mapping using the two key methods described above. While existing techniques generally extend the dynamic range from the highlights side, our new operator performs two-sided expansion, yielding enhanced details in shades (and highlights) with generally negligible visible contrast loss.

Input data perseveration is a method to train more responsive RNN-based models. Input data is replicated k times during training and deployment. Each replication propagates through the cell state and output of the RNN, but only the output at the final replication is maintained and broadcast as the prediction for evaluation.

Early detection of malignant lesions through accurate techniques and innovative technologies has a significant impact on reducing skin cancer mortality rates. Recently, artificial intelligence has come to the forefront to facilitate skin cancer diagnosis based on medical images. Many deep learning models have been studied and developed, but the imbalance of performance among classes in the multi-class classification is still a challenging problem. This study proposes a hybrid method for handling class imbalance of skin-disease classification. This method combines the data level method of balanced mini-batch logic followed by real-time image augmentation with the algorithm level method of designing new loss function. The training dataset includes 24,530 dermoscopic images of seven skin disease categories, which is by far the largest dataset of skin cancer. The performance metrics of six proposed methods are evaluated on a test dataset of 2,453 images.

Additionally, this study discusses the quality, usability, and size of the available chest X-ray datasets and techniques for coping with unbalanced datasets. A detailed comparison of the available studies reveals that the majority of the applied datasets are highly unbalanced and limited, providing unreliable results and rendering methods that are unsuitable for large-scale use. Large-scale balanced datasets can be obtained via smart techniques, such as generative adversarial networks. Current literature has indicated that deep learning-based algorithms achieve the best results for pneumonia classification with an accuracy of 98.7%, a sensitivity of 0.99, and a specificity of 0.98.

Illustrations are provided in a lattice defined on the unit-hypercube where a lattice interval corresponds to a conventional hyperbox. A specific scheme for learning by clustering is presented, namely /spl sigma/-fuzzy lattice learning scheme or /spl sigma/-FLL (scheme) for short, inspired from adaptive resonance theory (ART). Learning by the /spl sigma/-FLL is driven by an inclusion measure /spl sigma/ of the corresponding Cartesian product to be introduced here. We delineate a comparison of the /spl sigma/-FLL scheme with various neural-fuzzy and other models.

This paper proposes a novel multi-channel lightweight model (ML-Net), that provides a new solution for portable detection devices with limited resources. In ML-Net, each electrocardiogram (ECG) lead is assigned an independent channel, ensuring data independence and preserve the ECG characteristics of different angles represented by different leads. Moreover, convolution kernels of heterogeneous sizes are utilized to achieve accurate classification with only a small amount of lead data. Extensive experiments over actual ECG data from the PTB diagnostic database are conducted to evaluate ML-Net.

If a domain shift exists, i.e. differences in image statistics between training and test data, care needs to be taken to ensure reliable deployment in real-world scenarios. In digital pathology, domain shift can be manifested in differences between whole-slide images, introduced by for example differences in acquisition pipeline - between medical centers or over time. In order to harness the great potential presented by deep learning in histopathology, and ensure consistent model behavior, we need a deeper understanding of domain shift and its consequences, such that a model's predictions on new data can be trusted. This work focuses on the internal representation learned by trained convolutional neural networks, and shows how this can be used to formulate a novel measure - the representation shift - for quantifying the magnitude of model-specific domain shift. We perform a study on domain shift in tumor classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained images, by considering different datasets, models, and techniques for preparing data in order to reduce the domain shift. The results show how the proposed measure has a high correlation with drop in performance when testing a model across a large number of different types of domain shifts, and how it improves on existing techniques for measuring data shift and uncertainty. The proposed measure can reveal how sensitive a model is to domain variations, and can be used to detect new data that a model will have problems generalizing to.

Unlike the conventional AHP, the modified AHP allows us to process quantitative factors that are ranking outcomes of individual gene selection methods including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test, and signal-to-noise ratio. The IT2FLS is introduced for the classification task due to its great ability for handling nonlinear, noisy, and outlier data, which are common problems in cancer microarray gene expression profiles. An unsupervised learning strategy using the fuzzy c-means clustering is employed to initialize parameters of the IT2FLS. Other classifiers such as multilayer perceptron network, support vector machine, and fuzzy ARTMAP are also implemented for comparisons. Experiments are carried out on three well-known microarray datasets: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer, and prostate. Rather than the traditional cross validation, leave-one-out cross-validation strategy is applied for the experiments. Results demonstrate the performance dominance of the IT2FLS against the competing classifiers. More noticeably, the modified AHP improves the classification performance not only of the IT2FLS but of all other classifiers as well.

Semi-supervised methods leverage this issue by making use of a small labeled dataset and a larger set of unlabeled data. In this paper, we present a flexible framework for semi-supervised learning that combines the power of supervised methods that learn feature representations using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks with the deeply embedded clustering algorithm that assigns data points to clusters based on their probability distributions and feature representations learned by the networks. Our proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm based on deeply embedded clustering (SSLDEC) learns feature representations via iterations by alternatively using labeled and unlabeled data points and computing target distributions from predictions. During this iterative procedure, the algorithm uses labeled samples to keep the model consistent and tuned with labeling, as it simultaneously learns to improve feature representation and predictions. The SSLDEC requires a few hyper-parameters and thus does not need large labeled validation sets, which addresses one of the main limitations of many semi-supervised learning algorithms. It is also flexible and can be used with many state-of-the-art deep neural network configurations for image classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we implemented and tested our approach on benchmark image classification tasks as well as in a challenging medical image segmentation scenario.

10.1109/TCAD.2020.3032626,Sparse Tucker Tensor Decomposition on a Hybrid FPGA–CPU Platform,IEEE,Journals,"Recommendation systems, social network analysis, medical imaging, and data mining often involve processing sparse high-dimensional data. Such high-dimensional data are naturally represented as tensors, and they cannot be efficiently processed by conventional matrix or vector computations. Sparse Tucker decomposition is an important algorithm for compressing and analyzing these sparse high-dimensional datasets. When energy efficiency and data privacy are major concerns, hardware accelerators on resource-constraint platforms become crucial for the deployment of tensor algorithms. In this work, we propose a hybrid computing framework containing CPU and FPGA to accelerate sparse Tucker factorization. This algorithm has three main modules: 1) tensor-times-matrix (TTM); 2) Kronecker products; and 3) QR decomposition with column pivoting (QRP). In addition, we accelerate the former two modules on a Xilinx FPGA and the latter one on a CPU. Our hybrid platform achieves  $23.6 \times \sim 1091\times $  speedup and over 93.519% ~ 99.514% energy savings compared with CPU on the synthetic and real-world datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9233253/,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,Sept. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, there are still some open problems in anomalous behavior detection, such as the large and complicated model is difficult to train, the accuracy of anomalous behavior detection is not high enough and the speed is not fast enough. A spatiotemporal representation learning model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the spatial-temporal features of the video are extracted by the constructed multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network. Then the scene background is modeled by the high-dimensional mixed Gaussian model and used for anomaly detection. Finally, the accurate position of anomalous behavior in the video data is achieved by calculating the position of the last output feature, that is, the position of the receptive field. The proposed model does not require specific training. Moreover, the proposed method has the advantages of high versatility, fast calculation speed and high detection accuracy. We validated the proposed algorithm on two representative surveillance scene datasets, the Subway and the UCSDSped2. Results show that proposed algorithm has achieved the detection rate of 18 FPS under the condition of common computing resources, and meet the real-time requirements.

Fog-computing radio access network (F-RAN) is a newly developed network paradigm, in which the edge devices perform the storage, communication, control, configuration and management. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered to be a hopeful multiple access mechanism for future radio access networks (RANs). The distinctive feature of NOMA is to assign the same channel for various users simultaneously by utilizing the power domain. With the deployment of NOMA, F-RAN can further promote system throughput, time latency, access capability and spectrum efficiency. The coordination between NOMA and F-RAN provides powerful support to extensive application of augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), vehicular networking, intelligent medical and other emerging applications. In this paper, we focus on a noncooperative game resource optimization to decrease the complexity while the dynamic optimization problem is decoupled to subchannel assignment and power allocation. Matching theory is applied to propose a subchannel assignment scheme. Then, we convert and decouple the power allocation problem into three subproblems and solve them separately at each slot.

10.1109/TPAMI.2006.23,Symbolic signatures for deformable shapes,IEEE,Journals,"Recognizing classes of objects from their shape is an unsolved problem in machine vision that entails the ability of a computer system to represent and generalize complex geometrical information on the basis of a finite amount of prior data. A practical approach to this problem is particularly difficult to implement, not only because the shape variability of relevant object classes is generally large, but also because standard sensing devices used to capture the real world only provide a partial view of a scene, so there is partial information pertaining to the objects of interest. In this work, we develop an algorithmic framework for recognizing classes of deformable shapes from range data. The basic idea of our component-based approach is to generalize existing surface representations that have proven effective in recognizing specific 3D objects to the problem of object classes using our newly introduced symbolic-signature representation that is robust to deformations, as opposed to a numeric representation that is often tied to a specific shape. Based on this approach, we present a system that is capable of recognizing and classifying a variety of object shape classes from range data.

Though numerous empirical results supported the notion that such shared knowledge among tasks plays an essential role in MTL, the theoretical understanding of the relationships between tasks and their impact on learning shared knowledge is still an open problem. In this work, we are developing a theoretical perspective of the benefits involved in using information similarity for MTL. To this end, we first propose an upper bound on the generalization error by implementing the Wasserstein distance as the similarity metric. This indicates the practical principles of applying the similarity information to control the generalization errors. Based on those theoretical results, we revisited the adversarial multitask neural network and proposed a new training algorithm to learn the task relation coefficients and neural network parameters automatically.

In arthroscopic surgery education, the paradigm shift from apprenticeship to simulation training has driven the need for better simulators, and the current focus is on improving simulators with respect to computational efficiency and system accuracy. However, expanding surgical simulations towards digital twins has not yet been explored. This paper introduces the digital twin concept for arthroscopic surgery, and explores its potential in light of the existing scientific literature. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to summarize and analyze the literature with respect to fast and robust design of an arthroscopic digital twin using patient-specific information, and methods for interactive surgical soft tissue simulation. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol with three reliable scientific search engines: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and PubMed.

The surgeons' naked eye sometimes is not enough to accurately delineate the brain tumor location and extension due to its diffuse nature that infiltrates in the surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, a support system that provides accurate cancer delimitation is essential in order to improve the surgery outcomes and hence the patient's quality of life. The brain cancer detection system developed as part of the “HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection” (HELICoiD) European project meets this requirement exploiting a non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis: the hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A crucial constraint that this system has to satisfy is providing a real-time response in order to not prolong the surgery. The large amount of data that characterizes the hyperspectral images, and the complex elaborations performed by the classification system make the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems essential to provide real-time processing. The most efficient implementation developed in this work, which exploits the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology, is able to classify the biggest image of the database (worst case) in less than three seconds, largely satisfying the real-time constraint set to 1 minute for surgical procedures, becoming a potential solution to implement hyperspectral video processing in the near future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8949497/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

ESD is a form of skin disease. It generally causes redness of the skin and also may cause loss of skin. They are generally due to genetic or environmental factors. ESD comprises six classes of skin conditions namely, pityriasis rubra pilaris, lichen planus, chronic dermatitis, psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis and pityriasis rosea.

In general, this practice consists of two parts: extracting appropriate features from sensor signals and recognizing possible faulty patterns from the features. In order to cope with the complex manufacturing operations and develop a feasible system for real-time application, we proposed three approaches. By defining the marginal energy, a new feature representation emerged, while by real-time learning algorithms with support vector techniques and hidden Markov model representations, a modular software architecture and a new similarity measure were developed for comparison, monitoring, and diagnosis. A novel intelligent computer-based system has been developed and evaluated in over 30 factories and numerous metal stamping processes as an example of manufacturing operations. The real-time operation of this system demonstrated that the proposed system is able to detect abnormal conditions efficiently and effectively resulting in a low-cost, effective approach to real-time monitoring in manufacturing.

And the situation is exacerbated by the properties of velocity, variety and volume (3Vs) of big data. To recovery the system from performance anomaly, the first step is to find the root causes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature-based performance diagnosis approach to rapidly pinpoint the root causes of performance problems in big data platforms. The performance diagnosis is formalized as a pattern recognition problem. We leverage Maximum Information Criterion (MIC) to express the invariant relationships amongst the performance metrics in the normal state. Each performance problem occurred in the big data platform is signified by a unique binary vector named signature, which consists of a set of violations of MIC invariants. The signatures of multiple performance problems form a signature database. If the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of the big data application exhibits model drift, our approach can identify the real culprits by retrieving the root causes which have similar signatures to the current performance problem. Moreover, considering the diversity of big data applications, we establish an ensemble approach to treat each application separately. The experiment evaluations in a controlled big data platform show that our approach can pinpoint the real culprits of performance problems in an average 84% precision and 87% recall when one fault occurs, which is better than several state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359155/,2018 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE),26-29 March 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Compared with traditional methods, fault diagnosis method based on deep learning could approximate complex non-linear relationship and achieve very high precision under the same load. However, the performance of these deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods will be greatly reduced when the load changes, which are significant in fault diagnosis issues since the working load is changing all the time in real world industrial applications. Thus, a fault diagnosis method based on multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to solve this problem. CNN is a type of neural network which can extract feature from the fault signal directly. In order to obtain sufficient fault information, the proposed method uses multi-scale convolution kernels to extract features of different scales.

Rotating machineries use bearings to perform rotational or linear movement of various subcomponents while reducing friction and stress. Compared other types of bearing, REBs offer a good balance of key attributes like friction, lifetime, stiffness, speed and cost. Hence, real-time monitoring and diagnosis of bearings is crucial to prevent failures, improve safety, avoid unforeseen downtime of production assembly lines and lower cost. We propose an approach based on Wavelet Transform and ANN for analysis of vibration signals from a rolling element bearing to identify and multi-classify its component defects. The vibration signals from the REB being analyzed are passed over to the software setup consisting of Wavelet Transform and ANN. To remove noise and extract the relevant features from this signal, we pass the vibration signal through a Wavelet transform. These features are retrieved using time domain parameters like Skewness, Kurtosis, RMS and Crest Factor and they are used as an input for ANN classifier. The role of the ANN is to classify the bearing fault features produced by the Wavelet Transform and identify bearing faults, if any. To this end, we have designed a feedforward topology ANN using the sigmoid transfer function. The ANN training methodology uses three learning paradigms - namely, Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient Back-propogation and Scaled Conjugate method. The learning models generated by each algorithm are tested to find the one which gives better accuracy.

Most of these applications are developed considering vibration data from artificially induced faults. However, bearing failure in real-life can show huge damage variations even within a single category of failure which artificially induced failures are unable to represent. Thus, in this paper, the performance of classical CNN is evaluated on bearings with naturally occurring and progressing defects from the Paderborn University Dataset. A three-class (Healthy, Inner Race Fault and Outer Race Fault) classification problem is solved considering five bearing conditions within each class. These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: (1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; (2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness.

Adversarial samples are quasi-imperceptible to humans but can easily fool those deep models in the deploying phases, which may raise high risks in safety and security critical conditions. In view of that, this work proposes a novel real-time detection countermeasure called subspace diagnosis. First, principal component analysis has been utilized for feature subspace representations of images. After then, all extracted dimensions are divided into multiple clusters with a predefined scheme for the generation of unified monitoring statistics in various feature subspaces. For deciding the normal boundaries, Gaussian mixture model is considered and the Bayesian inference mechanism has been developed for adversarial example detection.

Majority of the faults which occur in induction motors are mainly diagnosed using motor current signature analysis. However, the accuracy of fault detection depends on selection of suitable features from motor current, the failure of which may result in incorrect interpretation. Considering the aforesaid fact, this paper presents an image processing aided deep learning framework for reliable diagnosis of induction motor faults, which eliminates the need of separate feature extraction stage. To this end, the motor current signals under different types of fault conditions were procured and were subsequently processed into frequency occurrence plots. The frequency occurrence image plots for different fault scenarios were finally used as inputs to a deep convolution neural network for the purpose of classification. Transfer learning technique was adopted to reduce the computation time of Convolution Neural Network and classification of motor faults was done at five different loading conditions. Four types of classification tasks have been addressed here and comprehensive analysis was done using a variety of CNN architectures.

Most matching systems do evaluation by comparing the correspondences with reference alignment. Since 2010 another method has been used to measure a logic-based of correspondence or mapping, called incoherent mapping measurement. The more incoherent of the mapping the lower quality of mapping. Incoherent mapping repair will restore the incoherent to coherent condition in mapping, by removing unwanted mapping. The process of removing unwanted mapping to restore the coherent condition is called diagnosis process. Since mappings are very important sources to support data integration and exchange, then diagnosis should be done as minimal as possible. We propose two focuses minimal using global new technique to repair the incoherent mapping. This approach should (1) ensure minimal impact on the input alignment by minimizing the number of mapping removed; and (2) minimize the average of confidence values of the mapping removed.

10.1109/SRDSW.2011.20,Distributed Fault Diagnosis Using Bayesian Reasoning in MAGNETO,IEEE,Conferences,"Many of the emerging telecom services make use of Outer Edge Networks, in particular Home Area Networks. The configuration and maintenance of such services may not be under full control of the telecom operator which still needs to guarantee the service quality experienced by the consumer. Diagnosing service faults in these scenarios becomes especially difficult since there may be not full visibility between different domains. This paper describes the fault diagnosis solution developed in the MAGNETO project, based on the application of Bayesian Inference to deal with the uncertainty. It also takes advantage of a distributed framework to deploy diagnosis components in the different domains and network elements involved, spanning both the telecom operator and the Outer Edge networks. In addition, MAGNETO features self-learning capabilities to automatically improve diagnosis knowledge over time and a partition mechanism that allows breaking down the overall diagnosis knowledge into smaller subsets. The MAGNETO solution has been prototyped and adapted to a particular outer edge scenario, and has been further validated on a real testbed.

Solving these domain adaptive transfer learning tasks has the potential to save large efforts on manually labeling data and modifying models for new machines in the same fleet.

One promising solution to this problem is to use domain adaptation techniques. It aims to improve model performance on the target new machine. Inspired by its successful implementation in computer vision, we introduced Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to our context, along with two other popular methods existing in previous fault diagnosis research.

The current diagnostic procedure uses patient assessments to evaluate symptoms and sometimes a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. However, symptom variations cause inaccurate assessments, and the analysis of MRI scans requires experienced specialists. This research proposes to use deep learning to diagnose PD severity by combining symptoms data and MRI data, all of which comes from the public Parkinson&#x2019;s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, in order to provide specialists and patients with more flexibility. A new hybrid model architecture was implemented to fully utilize both forms of clinical data to evaluate PD severity with high accuracy, and models based on only symptoms and only MRI scans were also developed. The developed model integrates a fully connected deep learning neural network for symptoms data training and a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network for MRI scans training. Instead of performing only binary classification, all models classify patients into five severity categories, with stage zero representing healthy patients and stages four and five representing patients with PD. The symptoms-only, MRI scans-only and hybrid models achieved accuracies of 0.77, 0.68, and 0.94, respectively. The hybrid model also had high precision and recall scores of 0.94 and 0.95. Real clinical cases confirm the hybrid model&#x2019;s strong performance, where patients were classified incorrectly with both other models but correctly by the hybrid.

10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00022,Identifying Root-Cause Metrics for Incident Diagnosis in Online Service Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Incidents in online service systems could incur poor user experience and tremendous economic loss. To reduce the influence of incidents and guarantee service reliability, it is critical to identify root-cause metrics for engineers with clues to assist incident diagnosis. However, it is a challenging task due to the complicated dependencies and huge volume of various metrics in large-scale systems. Existing approaches are based on either anomaly detection or correlation analysis, performing not well in terms of accuracy or efficiency. To better understand the problem of root-cause metric identification, we conduct a preliminary study based on real-world data analysis and interactions with engineers. The key observation is that root-cause metrics should satisfy two requirements. One is that the metric is expected to behave abnormally during the incident; the other is that the anomaly pattern should meet physical meaning and engineers&#x0027; demand. Motivated by the findings obtained from the study, we propose an effective approach named PatternMatcher to identifying root-cause metrics accurately. Specifically, PatternMatcher contains three steps, where coarse-grained anomaly detection aiming to filter out normal metrics, anomaly pattern classification aiming to filter out unimportant anomaly patterns, and root-cause metric ranking. An extensive study on four real-world datasets including 113 incident cases from a large commercial bank demonstrates that PatternMatcher outperforms all baseline approaches, achieving top-3 average accuracy of 0.91. Moreover, we have deployed PatternMatcher in practice and shared some successful cases from real deployment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9700253/,2021 IEEE 32nd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE),25-28 Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/APSEC.2018.00033,NotOnlyLog: Mining Patch-Log Associations from Software Evolution History to Enhance Failure Diagnosis Capability,IEEE,Conferences,"Log messages are widely used in the diagnosis of software failures. Existing studies of failure diagnosis based on log messages tend to use rule-based methods or execution-path-based methods. Rule-based methods generate bug-fixing rules using either human expertise, which is time consuming, or machine learning methods, which may lack the precision of failure diagnosis. To remedy these problems, researchers propose execution-path-based methods that reconstruct execution paths by analyzing source code and run-time logs. These methods, however, may lead to path explosion. To fill this gap, our work focuses on solving the path explosion problem in execution-path-based methods. We assume that run-time logs may have a relationship with their corresponding patches in real-world bug reports. We conduct empirical studies on seven open-source software packages and obtain two findings: (1) 80% of similar bugs have similar patches, and (2) 70% of faulty code is found to lie near the code where the first failure message is printed. Based on these two observations, we design and implement a practical tool NotOnlyLog for bug diagnosis. NotOnlyLog is able to mine the relationships between failure logs and their corresponding patches, in order to reduce both the number and length of uncertain execution paths in bug diagnosis. We evaluate the performance of NotOnlyLog on nine real-world bugs from three large open-source projects.

10.1049/cp:19970735,Pre-processing of acoustic signals by neural networks for fault detection and diagnosis of rolling mill,IET,Conferences,"Incipient faults and changes in the structure of any industrial process may be detected and known by their effects: vibration and/or acoustic signals. We consider some methods for pre-processing the acoustic signal, generated by a rolling mill process, for fault detection and structural classification. The pre-processing methods are based on artificial neural networks. The methods refer to: signal decomposition algorithms, a distances measure for spectral amplitude classification and neural network structures for spectrum compression. For the signal decomposition problem an adaptive neural network algorithm is proposed in which the number of inputs is adapted to the imposed error. When the training error for two successive steps is very little, then the number of inputs in network is increased. If the spectral components are zero for sufficient time, then the number of inputs is decreased. The Hausdorff distance is proposed for spectrum classification as the distance measure for the frequency domain in a pattern recognition context. It shown that the Hausdorff distance has a monotone relationship with the signal-to-noise-ratio. Finally, the possibility of decreasing the number of spectrum components as patterns is presented, by compression with neural networks. Spectral representations of the acoustic source show that signatures collected at rolling mill sensor locations can be successfully used to identify process and structural changes in the rolling mill monitoring system.

First, the main working condition parameters (MWCP) are extracted according to the mutual information between the performance parameters and working condition parameters, and used as input feature vector to construct the RDM-WNN model. Second, relative residual are calculated by comparing the output vector of RDM-WNN model to the corresponding real values. Third, the relative residual values are used to implement quantitative diagnosis of HGU using weighted fuzzy set theory.

Timely diagnosis of faults of rotating machinery equipment is of great significance to maintain the reliability and safety of the whole system. Since the development of fault diagnosis technology, there have been many diagnosis methods that can be applied to rotating machinery, and these methods have achieved good results. However, many of these methods cannot balance the relationship between diagnostic accuracy and timeliness very well, and require high computing capabilities of the device, which is not conducive to algorithm deployment on hardware devices, and the long diagnosis time is not conducive to real-time monitoring of the rotating machinery. This paper takes the core component bearing of rotating machinery equipment as the object, and proposes a fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM).

Furthermore, the data obtained in many industrial applications is not labelled, so that a classification of intact and defective bearings is often not possible. This paper presents an approach for an AI-system that is trained with a bearing fault simulation and can then be deployed in industrial applications. A method for bearing fault simulation is presented which is based on the superposition of characteristic fault frequencies of a bearing. With the data from the simulation, an AI-system is implemented with a two-stage approach for fault detection and diagnosis. First, a semi-supervised k-nearest neighbor distance measure is calculated using synthetic data from the simulation. From this, a suitable value for the number of neighbors k is defined and the threshold at which a sample is considered faulty is determined. Then the AI-system is deployed in an industrial application and real world data is analysed with the given value for k and the threshold.

10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698581,Towards the Development of a Photovoltaic Array Fault Detection and Diagnosis (PVAFDD) System,IEEE,Conferences,"The perpetual increment in energy demand continues to put pressure on the South African Economy. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) have been contracted to relieve the strain by supplementing energy production using solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies. These IPPs are paid per megawatt they produce and face stiff penalties should they fail to deliver on contractual obligations. Naturally solar PV plants are susceptible to numerous PV faults that could lead to a negative return on investment. It therefore makes economic sense to adopt mechanisms that can be able to detect, localize and diagnose PV faults when they occur within a solar PV system. There exists an extensive literature on how to detect and diagnose PV faults, however, localizing PV faults is still in its infancy. This paper proposes to cater to the needs of the IPPs by developing an intelligent PV Array Fault Detection and Diagnostics (PVAFDD) system capable of localizing PV faults which can be embedded into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system used to manage and control such PV systems. The PVAFDD system is based on a machine learning (ML) model implemented using logistic regression algorithm. The ML model is trained using meteorological data ranging over a period of eight years in Alice, Eastern Cape. Using simulations driven by real-life data scenarios, we have been able to train, validate and test the PVAFDD system. When the PVAFDD system detects a fault, a cascade of real-time PVA tests is undertaken to localize the PV fault. The system then carries out PVA fault diagnostics and gives recommendations on the PV fault classification. Corrective measures can therefore be implemented on the affected PVA swiftly reducing the downtime of the PV plant, ergo proving to be a cost-effective measure that offers a competitive edge to IPPs using the PVAFDD system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9698581/,"2021 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Energy Technologies (ICECET)",9-10 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the second stage, the prognosis stage, the deviation of the real-time measurement data from the estimated values was calculated. If the deviation increases beyond a confidence band, an alarm is triggered and a proposed risk indicator is updated.

However, the wide applications of this scheme are generally compromised in real-world conditions because of the discrepancy between the training data and testing data. Although the recently emerging transfer fault diagnosis can learn transferable features from relevant source data and adapt the diagnostic model to the target data, these methods still only work on the target domain with a priori data distribution. The generalization capability of the transferred model cannot be guaranteed for unseen domains. Since the working conditions of machinery are varying during operation, the generalization capability of the diagnosis methods is crucial in this case. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a domain generalization-based hybrid diagnosis network for deploying to unseen working conditions. The main idea is to regularize the discriminant structure of the deep network with both intrinsic and extrinsic generalization objectives such that the diagnostic model can learn robust features and generalize to unseen domains. The triplet loss minimization of intrinsic multisource data is implemented to facilitate the intraclass compactness and the interclass separability at the class level, leading to a more generalized decision boundary. The extrinsic domain-level regularization is achieved by using adversarial training to further reduce the risk of overfitting.

However, since EEG signals are highly complex, nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, both visual inspection and the existing computed aid detection approaches fail to capture the intrinsic dynamics of seizure events, leading to unsatisfactory detection performance. Therefore, an accurate computer-aided automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis system is valuable and urgently needed in clinical application. In this study, we propose an automatic classification method using nonlinear dynamics features and nonlinear classifiers for determining whether the EEG signals are in interictal or ictal activities, respectively. The main novelty of this paper is that investigating the performance of discernable entropy-based nonlinear dynamics features used for automatic diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. First, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to obtain de-noised and sub-band signals. Second, the nonlinear dynamics features are extracted based on information entropy theory. Subsequently, one-way analysis of variance and forward sequential feature selection technique are employed to identify the most explainable features for seizure detection. Then the selected features are fed to six different classifiers, namely, least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest, for automatic diagnosis of the epileptic seizure. Finally, a public EEG dataset from Bonn University, Germany, is utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the LS-SVM yields the optimal performance with an accuracy of 99.50%, a sensitivity of 100.00%, and a specificity of 99.40%.

A risk may be defined as the effects of uncertainty on the achievement of the goals of a company, some of which can be associated with security aspects (e.g., data corruption or data leakage). The execution of the activities can be choreographed using business processes models, in which the risk of the entire business process model derives from a combination of the single activity risks (executed in an isolated manner). In this paper, a risk assessment method is proposed to enable the analysis and evaluation of a set of activities combined in a business process model to ascertain whether the model conforms to the security-risk objectives. To achieve this objective, we use a business process extension with security-risk information to: 1) define an algorithm to verify the level of risk of process models; 2) design an algorithm to diagnose the risk of the activities that fail to conform to the level of risk established in security-risk objectives; and 3) the implementation of a tool that supports the described proposal.

Under this framework, aiming at the influence of CNCMT failure on the initial production planning, a self-adaptation rescheduling method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm is proposed to provide support for developing more efficient production planning. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by experimental study.

In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD).

Recently, deep learning has achieved remarkable performance in fault classification tasks. However, in reality, the model can be deployed under highly varying working environments. As a result, the model trained under a certain working environment (i.e., certain distribution) can fail to generalize well on data from different working environments (i.e., different distributions). The naive approach of training a new model for each new working environment would be infeasible in practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel conditional contrastive domain generalization (CCDG) approach for fault diagnosis of rolling machinery, which is able to capture shareable class information and learn environment-independent representation among data collected from different environments (also known as domains). Specifically, our CCDG attempts to maximize the mutual information of similar classes across different domains while minimizing mutual information among different classes, such that it can learn domain-independent class representation that can be transferable to new unseen domains. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world fault diagnosis datasets with an average improvement of 7.75&#x0025; and 2.60&#x0025;, respectively.

The intelligent fault diagnosis method has been widely used to accurately diagnose bearing faults. However, in engineering practice, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sample data to train the intelligent diagnosis model. Therefore, in this article, a fusion diagnosis model CGAN-2-D-CNN that combines a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN) is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis with small samples. Considering the problem of insufficient sample data, CGAN is used to learn the data distribution of real samples to generate new samples with similar data distribution by the confrontation training of the generator and discriminator. Then, 2-D preprocessing is conducted to convert the generated 1-D data into 2-D gray images. Finally, these images are input into the 2-D-CNN to extract the features and classify the bearing fault types. Two experimental cases are implemented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CGAN-2-D-CNN. The experimental results illustrate that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method used on the small sample data is close to that of the 2-D-CNN directly used on the enough original sample data whose size is equal to the expanded sample size.

In particular, we show that different domains can be linked through adversarial learning with data available in different working conditions to facilitate the training of the model, as it is impractical to acquire data for all conditions in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the initial failure is a difficult problem to diagnose because it does not show a significant difference from the normal data between different conditions. Moreover, if only the domain discriminator is judged when adapting the domain, it tends to easily cause misclassification, so the reliability of the detection result needs to be improved. In this study, we propose a new learning method that improves classification performance by sharing the classification characteristics of the classifier for each task with the target domain characteristic generator. The proposed mechanism uses spatial attention to extract the focused partial information of the feature generator and discriminator, and further enhances task-specific features using the attention mechanism between the two extracted information types. Addresses the challenge of implementing both domain adaptation and classification. Extensive experimentation demonstrates efficiency and improved classification performance on benchmark and real-world application datasets.

Machine learning-based methods are increasingly being used for fault diagnosis applications. However, the performance of such detection algorithms will degrade because of variations between the source domain data used during the development and the target domain data encountered in operation of the field. Furthermore, the fault's data in the target domain for model training are usually not available. In this paper, domain adaptation combined with deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DA-DCGAN)-based methodology is proposed, where DA-DCGAN first learns an intelligent normal-to-arcing transformation from the source-domain data. Then by generating dummy arcing data with the learned transformation using the normal data from the target domain and employing domain adaptation, a robust and reliable fault diagnosis scheme can be achieved for the target domain. The PV loop current is framed and arranged into a 2D matrix as input for cross-domain DC series arc fault diagnosis.

However, most of the studies are run in controlled environments and the performance in industrial real-world environments is not yet fully validated. Hence, a suitable tool to implement fault diagnosers is transfer learning, this topic is under development and challenges persist. This paper proposes a framework for creating accurate 1D-CNN based fault classifiers that can be transferred between different rotating machines and working conditions. Multiple Bayesian processes select architecture parameters and hyperparameters, which minimize a loss function related to their transferability to other machines and to the same machine under different operating conditions (such as load and engine speed). The resulting model is fitted to heterogeneous fault diagnosis data resulting in a 1D-CNN ensemble that improves the performance of the unitary model. Subsequently, the transfer learning capability of the ensemble is analyzed on two source data sets using function and parameter based transfer. The results are compared with classical fault diagnosis classifiers. Finally, additional transfer operations on five target domain datasets validate our framework on limited labeled samples and allow interpretation of the ensemble results.

In designing reliable cellular networks, it is essential to predict spectrum saturation events in the future by analyzing the past behavior of base stations, especially their frequency resource block (RB) utilization states. This paper investigates a deep learning-based forecasting strategy of the future RB usage rate (RBUR) status of hundreds of LTE base stations deployed in Seoul, South Korea. The dataset consists of real measurement RBUR samples with a randomly varying number of base stations at each measurement time. This poses a difficulty in handling variable-length RBUR data vectors, which is not trivial for state-of-the-art deep learning estimation models, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), developed for handling fixed-length inputs. To this end, we propose a two-step RBUR estimation approach. In the first step, we extract a useful feature of the RBUR dataset that accurately approximates the behavior of the top quantile base stations. The feature parameters are carefully designed to be fixed-length vectors regardless of the dimensions of the raw RBUR samples. The fixed-length feature parameter vectors are readily exploited as the training dataset of RNN-based prediction models. Thus, in the second step, we propose a feature estimation strategy where the RNN is trained to predict the future RBUR from the input feature parameter sequences. With the estimated RBUR at hand, we can easily predict the spectrum saturation of the future LTE systems by examining the resource utilization states of the top quantile base stations.

Considering computing resources and communication loss of multiple clients, an efficient method based on stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAEs) and Siamese networks is proposed to detect interturn short-circuit (ITSC) faults in permanent magnet synchronous motors.

Here, we introduce the idea of zero-shot learning into the industry field, and tackle the zero-sample fault diagnosis task by proposing the fault description based attribute transfer method. Specifically, the method learns to determine the fault categories using the human-defined fault descriptions instead of the collected fault samples.The defined description consists of arbitrary attributes of the faults, including the fault positions, the consequences of the fault, and even the cause of the fault, etc. For the attribute knowledge of target faults, they can be prelearned and transferred from some readily available faults occurred in the same process.

Recently developed deep learning methods show their ability to distinguish some severe heart diseases. However, since deep neural network requires a high cost on memory consumption and computation, implementation scenarios of these interpretation methods are constrained to nonportable devices. Few commercial portable devices only have heartbeat detection ability, and therefore, only a few simple cardiac diseases can be diagnosed. In this article, to achieve diagnosing a wide range of cardiac diseases and continuous monitoring, a homecare-oriented ECG diagnosis platform is designed based on a large-scale multilabel deep conventional neural network.

However, DNN training takes a long time due to its complex calculation, which makes it difficult to optimize and retrain models. To address such an issue, this work proposes a novel fault diagnosis model by combining binarized DNNs (BDNNs) with improved random forests (RFs). First, a BDNN-based feature extraction method with binary weights and activations in a training process is designed to reduce the model runtime without losing the accuracy of feature extraction. Its generated features are used to train an RF-based fault classifier to relieve the information loss caused by binarization. Second, considering the possible classification accuracy reduction resulting from those very similar binarized features of two instances with different classes, we replace a Gini index with ReliefF as the attribute evaluation measure in training RFs to further enhance the separability of fault features extracted by BDNN and accordingly improve the fault identification accuracy. Third, an edge computing-based fault diagnosis mode is proposed to increase diagnostic efficiency, where our diagnosis model is deployed distributedly on a number of edge nodes close to the end rotational machines in distinct locations. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method on the data sets from rolling element bearings, and the results demonstrate that, in almost all cases, its diagnostic accuracy is competitive to the state-of-the-art DNNs and even higher due to a form of regularization in some cases. Benefited from the relatively lower computing and storage requirements of BDNNs, it is easy to be deployed on edge nodes to realize real-time fault diagnosis concurrently. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;Rotating machines, such as engines and motors, are the cornerstones of the modern industry. Edge computing is an emerging computing paradigm where computation is performed on the edges of networks rather than on the central cloud, thereby reducing system response time, transmission overhead, storage space, and computation resources of the cloud. Motivated by the high demand on computation for deploying DNN models and lower computation complexity for running BDNN models and easiness for large-scale deployment of BDNNs, an edge computing-based method for real-time fault diagnosis of rotating machines is proposed. First, we design a BDNN-based feature extractor to decrease the amount of computation and speed up a diagnosis processes. Then, the resulting binary features are fed to train an RF-based classifier, where we use ReliefF instead of Gini index when training a random forest model to further improve the proposed method&#x2019;s diagnostic accuracy. Finally, a novel cloud-edge collaborative computing-based fault diagnostic mode is presented, where the model trained from the central cloud is deployed on the edge computing devices distributed in large-scale scenarios to realize real-time fault diagnosis.

However, it is difficult to identify anomalies based on the voluminous, high-dimensional, and noisy data collected by system monitoring infrastructures. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to automatically diagnose performance anomalies at runtime. Our framework leverages historical resource usage data to extract signatures of previously-observed anomalies. We first convert collected time series data into easy-to-compute statistical features. We then identify the features that are required to detect anomalies, and extract the signatures of these anomalies. At runtime, we use these signatures to diagnose anomalies with negligible overhead. We evaluate our framework using experiments on a real-world HPC supercomputer and demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies 98 percent of injected anomalies and consistently outperforms existing anomaly diagnosis techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466019/,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1 April 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/JIOT.2020.2994200,Optimization of Edge-PLC-Based Fault Diagnosis With Random Forest in Industrial Internet of Things,IEEE,Journals,"Facing globalized competition, there have been increasing requirements for safety and efficiency in smart factories, where the industrial Internet of Things can enable the monitoring of equipment's status and the detecting of faults before they go critical. Regarding cloud computing, data-driven methods running at clouds are adopted to train the model with a large amount of raw data at the beginning, then end machines upload their real-time readings to the cloud center for processing. However, this incurs considerable computational costs and may sometimes bear a severe delay. In this article, we consider a hierarchical structure where edge-PLCs are employed to gather sensed data locally and reduce communication costs. Since a single fault may be related to multiple influencing features, we want to first minimize the number of features that need to determine a fault, then try to find out the minimal set of edge-PLCs which can cover all key features so as to save the deployment cost. We propose a random-forest-based method to handle the features selection problem, and then the selection of edge-PLCs by solving the set coverage problem. Through the simulation on real data trace, we compare our method with other artificial-intelligence-based methods, such as the logistics regression model and its extensions. The results prove the efficiency and performance of the proposed method, which reaches or even exceeds the accuracy of methods using the full set of data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9091605/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/3476.585143,Real-time diagnosis of semiconductor manufacturing equipment using a hybrid neural network expert system,IEEE,Journals,"This paper presents a tool for the real-time diagnosis of integrated circuit fabrication equipment. The approach focuses on integrating neural networks into an expert system. The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line post-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the ease of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, continuous hypothesis testing on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts. A working prototype for this hybrid diagnostic system has been implemented on the Plasma Therm 700 series reactive ion etcher located in the Georgia Tech Microelectronics Research Center.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/585143/,"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C",Jan. 1997,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/OJIES.2022.3172899,SA1D-CNN: A Separable and Attention Based Lightweight Sensor Fault Diagnosis Method for Solar Insecticidal Lamp Internet of Things,IEEE,Journals,"Sensor faults can produce abnormal and spurious observations in the solar insecticidal lamp Internet of Things (SIL-IoTs) system. Early detection and identification of the sensor node&#x2019;s abnormality are critical to ensure the SIL-IoTs system&#x2019;s reliability. In this study, we propose a lightweight separable 1D convolution neural network that can be implemented in SIL-IoTs nodes to identify sensor faults, reduce detecting delay, and decrease data transmission. However, the reliability of data acquired by sensors is decreased because a SIL-IoTs node releases high voltage pulse discharge (a kind of electromagnetic interference) when pests collide with its metal mesh. This kind of data fluctuation impacts fault diagnosis accuracy. Consequently, fault-related feature maps and temporal signals are characterized via a novel time and channel attention module (TCAM) method, which contributes to separating electromagnetic interference noise from sensor faults of SIL-IoTs nodes. A real-world testbed is applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on sensor fault diagnosis in the SIL-IoTs system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect four typical sensor faults with the best trade-off between accuracy (99.9&#x0025; average accuracy and 97.6&#x0025; average F1-score) and efficiency (351 KB inference model size and 4.33 W average energy consumption on Raspberry Pi).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9769996/,IEEE Open Journal of the Industrial Electronics Society,2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In practice, however, the fault data of WT are limited, which makes it hard to identify faults of WT accurately using the existing intelligent diagnosis methods. To address this, signals augmented self-taught learning network (SASLN) is proposed for the fault diagnosis of the generator, which is one of the most important parts in WT. In SASLN, fault signal samples are generated by the Wasserstein distance guided generative adversarial networks to expand the limited training data set. The sufficient generated signal samples are used to pretrain the self-taught learning network (SLN) to enhance the generalization ability of SLN. Then, the weights of SLN are fine-tuned using a small number of real signal samples for accurate fault classification. The effectiveness of SASLN is verified by two bearing vibration data sets. The results show that SASLN can achieve fairly high fault classification accuracy using small training samples. Besides, SASLN has good robustness in noisy working environment and can also identify faults even in variable loads and variable rotating speeds cases, which makes it meaningful for decreasing the running costs and improving the maintenance management of WT.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9285302/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this article, we aim to detect driver inattention leveraging on large-scale vehicle trajectory data while at the same time explore how do these inattentive events affect driver behaviors and what following reactions they may cause, especially, for commercial vehicles. Specifically, the proposed system targets four most commonly occurring critical inattentive events, including smoking, phone call, turning back, and yawning. By applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) (Inception v3) with two data augmentation routines—Mixup and synthetic minority oversampling technique (Smote), we are able to balance the training data distribution and improve the generalization of the classification model.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.142,7A-4 A New Method for Enhancing Dynamic Vascular Patterns of Focal Liver Lesions in Contrast Ultrasound,IEEE,Conferences,"The differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLL) frequently presents a dilemma, as FLL cannot be reliably characterized with conventional ultrasound. Recently, ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) and contrast-specific imaging methods have substantially improved the characterization of FLL. This was made possible by the known differences in dynamic vascular patterns (DVP) between healthy parenchyma and various FLL types, revealed by UCA. The purpose of this work was to develop a new method, called DVP processing, which provides a DVP-enhanced imaging mode of FLL using contrast ultrasound; this mode allows an improved differentiation of benign from malignant lesions. DVP processing consists in generating a sequence of images, where hyper-echoic and hypo- echoic pixels, compared to reference levels taken in healthy parenchyma, are coded over time in warm and cold colors, respectively. For example, a benign lesion remains hyper-echoic over time, while a malignant lesion is hyper-echoic in the arterial phase and turns into hypo-echoic in the portal phase. This method was implemented as an image-processing software program, which was the object of clinical evaluation. Sequences of 111 FLL were acquired with real-time low-MI contrast- specific ultrasound after a 2.5-mL bolus injection of SonoVuetrade, and subsequently analyzed off-fine with DVP processing. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by two clinical observers in this way were 92%, and 86%, respectively. These results reflect a significant improvement over accuracy scores achieved with contrast-enhanced ultrasound alone, having resulted in 93% and 82% in sensitivity and specificity, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4409715/,2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings,28-31 Oct. 2007,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Secondly, support vector machines (SVM) are implemented to classify the data into pixel-wised liver or non-liver. Finally, specially combined morphological operations are designed as a post processor to remove noise and to delineate the liver. Our unique contributions to liver segmentation are twofold: one is that it has been proved through experiments that wavelet features present better classification than Haralick texture descriptors when SVMs are used; the other is that the combination of morphological operations with a pixel-wised SVM classifier can delineate volumetric liver accurately.

While anomaly detection is a valid approach to avoid unplanned maintenance or even complete breakdown, its effective realization in IIoT requires the design and implementation of frameworks for efficient monitoring, data collection, and analysis. Most of the existing anomaly detection techniques provide only a diagnosis of the fault without taking into account the uncertainty. Moreover, the lack of ground truth data (which is a typical problem in the industrial context), make their implementation even more challenging.

The paper is a continuation of the work presented by the authors at the IEEE-PCIC 2017 conference in Calgary. The proposed asset management system analyses condition monitoring (CM) data and assesses the risk of failure data across complete HV networks. Knowledge of deteriorating asset condition provides the operator with an advanced, early warning of incipient mechanical and electrical faults. With knowledge of the severity and source of such faults, pinpointed preventative maintenance interventions can then made during planned maintenance outages. The complete HV network asset monitoring solution described includes permanent sensors and monitoring nodes deployed at strategic locations across the network. Processed data is passed via a local area network to local servers and then via secure data cloud transmission to a centralized monitoring server located at the CM headquarters. This central server operates a CM database that logs, displays, benchmarks and trends the condition data with comparison to a statistically-significant database of measurements. It is proposed in the IIoT solution proposed that this database will be downloadable to a smartphone/tablet for use by the field engineer. The monitoring technology will likely also incorporate a number of AI machine learning software modules for the de-noising of raw signals and the diagnosis of different types of defects within different types of HV plant items. The proposed SMART CM system includes an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing HV asset CM data along with operational and maintenance (O&M) data.

Identification of atrial sites which are effective ablation targets remains challenging. Supervised machine learning has emerged as an effective tool for handling classification problems with multiple features. The main goal of this work is to use learning algorithms in predicting the responses of ablating electrograms and their effect on terminating AF and the cycle length changes. A total of 3,206 electrograms (EGMs) from ten persistent AF (persAF) patients were used. 5-fold cross-validation was applied, in which 80 % of the data were used as training set and 20 % used as validation. Dominant frequency (DF) and organisation index (OI) were calculated from EGMs (264 seconds) for all patients and used as input features. A k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier was trained using ablation lesion data and deployed in additional 17,274 EGMs that were not ablated. The classification accuracy of 85.2 % was achieved for the KNN classifier.

In particular, advanced techniques for finding faults through the use of explicit structural and/or behavioural models of the physical system to be diagnosed have been developed both in the area of control engineering and in the field of artificial intelligence. Although many approaches to creating model-based diagnostic systems (MBDS) exist, as yet, no clear methodology is available for the selection of an appropriate approach to solve individual given diagnostic problems. We have therefore been developing a specification methodology that essentially comprises a taxonomy of diagnostic tasks, a taxonomy of model-based systems, and a set of guidelines that provides a mapping from the former to the latter, Our aim is to provide a method by which existing MBDS tools and techniques may be combined within a generic architecture in a principled manner to produce effective diagnostic systems for given applications. The structure of the methodology has been derived in part from the top level architectural design of ARTIST, a generic model-based diagnostic toolkit that combines a wide variety of model based diagnostic (MBD) tools.

In this research area the improvements in systems for clinical specular microscopy in vivo made a strong contribution to the study and the comprehension of the physiopathology of corneal endothelium. The more recent systems allow acquisition of the images and morphometric analysis. Nevertheless, the results (i.e. the automated reconstruction of the endothelium cell borders) are often inaccurate. Moreover, they do not allow the correct recognition of the cell shapes. On the other hand, even if the semiautomatic systems allow an effective evaluation of the cell shape, they are highly time consuming and provide results that could be affected by the criterion used by the operator in the cell corner detection.

This paper describes two parts of a project carried out at the University of Dundee for Scottish Hydro-Electric plc (HE) on the use of an artificial intelligence system for alarm processing and fault diagnosis. The first part of the project was an overview and comparison study of three real-time object-oriented toolkits: Muse, Kappa and Nexpert Object. The study is based on the capabilities of such toolkits to handle the power system alarm processing integration with external programs and real-time databases, portability, price and execution speed.

Portfolio scheduling addresses the dynamic aspect of the workload. Q-learning, allows our approach to adapt to the periodic patterns of the workload, and to tune the other configuration parameters. The proposed policies are heuristics that guide the provisioning process, and map workflow tasks to the provisioned cloud resources. Through real-world experiments based on real and synthetic industrial workloads, we analyze and compare our prototype implementation of ANANKE with a system without portfolio scheduling (baseline) and with a system equipped with a standard portfolio scheduler.

Recently, deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been employed widely for the classification of objects. Moreover, it is promising that lots of networks can be deployed on wearable devices. An increasing number of methods can be used to realize ECG signal classification for the sake of arrhythmia detection. However, the existing neural networks proposed for arrhythmia detection are not hardware-friendly enough due to a remarkable quantity of parameters resulting in memory and power consumption. In this paper, we present a 1-D adaptive loss-aware quantization, achieving a high compression rate that reduces memory consumption by 23.36 times.

A back propagation (BP) neural network was trained to predict projection values of CO<inf>2</inf> and CO mole fractions from integral absorbances of H<inf>2</inf>O spectrum centered at 7185.6 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 7444.4 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> along the same projections. And the datasets for network training and testing were generated using a pentagonal fan beam arrangement derived from a real TDLAS tomographic sensor.

10.1109/MALTESQUE.2018.8368457,ConfigFile++: Automatic comment enhancement for misconfiguration prevention,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, misconfiguration has become one of the key factors leading to system problems. Most current research on the topic explores misconfiguration diagnosis, but is less concerned with educating users about how to configure correctly in order to prevent misconfiguration before it happens. In this paper, we manually study 22 open source software projects and summarize several observations on the comments of their configuration files, most of which lack sufficient information and are poorly formatted. Based on these observations and the general process of misconfiguration diagnosis, we design and implement a tool called ConfigFile++ that automatically enhances the comment in configuration files. By using name-based analysis and machine learning, ConfigFile++ extracts guiding information about the configuration option from the user manual and source code, and inserts it into the configuration files. The format of insert comment is also designed to make enhanced comments concise and clear. We use real-world examples of misconfigurations to evaluate our tool. The results show that ConfigFile++ can prevent 33 out of 50 misconfigurations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8368457/,2018 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning Techniques for Software Quality Evaluation (MaLTeSQuE),20-20 March 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, ECG recording is vulnerable to different types of noises and artifacts that make it very difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis. In this context, we propose a novel ECG denoising algorithm based on the deep Convolutional Denoising Auto-Encoder (CDAE) which requires minimal preprocessing steps, and conserves the important ECG features. In this study, the proposed CDAE algorithm is specifically implemented to remove the Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN) from the recorded ECG signal. The CDAE was trained, validated and tested on a set of real ECG signals acquired from the well-known MIT-BIH-Arrythmia (MITDB) database with artificially generated AWGN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to some of the state-of-the-art methods.

Despite neural immaturity, seizures can also occur in preterm infants. However, surprisingly little is known about their evolution after an HI insult or patterns of expression. An improved understanding of preterm seizures will help facilitate diagnosis and prognosis and the implementation of treatments. This requires improved detection of seizures, including electrographic seizures. We have established a stable preterm fetal sheep model of HI that results in different types of post-HI seizures. These including the expression of epileptiform transients during the latent phase (0-6 h) of cerebral energy recovery, and bursts of high amplitude stereotypic evolving seizures (HAS) during the secondary phase of cerebral energy failure (~6-72 h). We have previously developed successful automated machine-learning strategies for accurate identification and quantification of the evolving micro-scale EEG patterns (e.g. gamma spikes and sharp waves), during the latent phase. The current paper introduces, for the first time, a real-time approach that employs a 15-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, directly fed with the raw EEG time-series, to identify HAS in the 1024Hz and 256Hz down-sampled data in our preterm fetuses post-HI. The classifier was trained and tested using EEG segments during ~6 to 48 hours post-HI recordings. The classifier accurately identified HAS with 98.52% accuracy in the 1024Hz and 97.78% in the 256Hz data.

One of them is the so-called Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), which tries to disaggregate the consumed energy on a household or building, based on the voltage, current and/or power measurements carried out in a single smart meter. NILM techniques often vary according to the variables measured and their corresponding sampling frequency, thus determining the final application. In recent years, these NILM techniques have become relevant in the field of Ambient Intelligence for Independent Living, where the identification of loads and the detection of the on/off switching in appliances can be used to infer the householders’ behavior in a non-intrusive way. This is the basis for further applications, such as diagnosis support tools, monitoring proposals for carers, or alert systems.

This work proposes the use of a fault injection framework to generate data that resembles the behaviour of failed components during startup. The data generated can then be used for developing fault diagnostic mechanisms.

However, outages, i.e., severe incidents that always impact multiple services, can dramatically affect user experience and incur severe economic losses. Locating the root-cause service, i.e., the service that contains the root cause of the outage, is a crucial step to mitigate the impact of the outage. In current industrial practice, this is generally performed in a bootstrap manner and largely depends on human efforts: the service that directly causes the outage is identified first, and the suspected root cause is traced back manually from service to service during diagnosis until the actual root cause is found. Unfortunately, production cloud systems typically contain a large number of interdependent services. Such a manual root cause analysis is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose COT, the first outage triage approach that considers the global view of service correlations. COT mines the correlations among services from outage diagnosis data. After learning from historical outages, COT can infer the root cause of emerging ones accurately. We implement COT and evaluate it on a real-world dataset containing one year of data collected from Microsoft Azure, one of the representative cloud computing platforms in the world.

Some fields, as industrial process control and product development can be highly benefited by the development of techniques based on the proven potentialities of ANN models, allowing more accurate simulation, better adaptation to changing environments, and greater robustness in model-based fault diagnosis. Along with the advance of ANNs, there is a trend of open-source softwares use for soft computing which facilitates the access of the interested readers to implement their own codes and to explore other applications. Historically evolutionary algorithms such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been implemented to evolve the architectures to search for solutions, in order to solve this fundamental issue that is still an open problem in the general case. Therefore, the present paper investigates the application of ANN to model the nonlinear aircraft turbojet engine through black-box approach. For that purpose it was used real-world measurements of aircraft engine's fuel and rotation as input and output, respectively.

10.1109/ECTICON.2008.4600483,Grape leaf disease detection from color imagery using hybrid intelligent system,IEEE,Conferences,"Vegetables and fruits are the most important export agricultural products of Thailand. In order to obtain more value-added products, a product quality control is essentially required. Many studies show that quality of agricultural products may be reduced from many causes. One of the most important factors of such quality is plant diseases. Consequently, minimizing plant diseases allows substantially improving quality of the products. This work presents automatic plant disease diagnosis using multiple artificial intelligent techniques. The system can diagnose plant leaf disease without maintaining any expertise once the system is trained. Mainly, the grape leaf disease is focused in this work. The proposed system consists of three main parts: (i) grape leaf color segmentation, (ii) grape leaf disease segmentation, and (iii) analysis & classification of diseases. The grape leaf color segmentation is pre-processing module which segments out any irrelevant background information. A self-organizing feature map together with a back-propagation neural network is deployed to recognize colors of grape leaf. This information is used to segment grape leaf pixels within the image. Then the grape leaf disease segmentation is performed using modified self-organizing feature map with genetic algorithms for optimization and support vector machines for classification. Finally, the resulting segmented image is filtered by Gabor wavelet which allows the system to analyze leaf disease color features more efficient. The support vector machines are then again applied to classify types of grape leaf diseases. The system can be able to categorize the image of grape leaf into three classes: scab disease, rust disease and no disease. The proposed system shows desirable results which can be further developed for any agricultural product analysis/inspection system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4600483/,"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology",14-17 May 2008,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to its direct impact on Central Nervous System if tumor cells prevail at certain locations in the brain, the overall functionality of the body is disturbed and chances of a person approaching death accelerate. Tumors can be cancerous or non-cancerous but in many cases, the chances of complete recovery are less and as a result death rate has increased all over the world despite recent advancements in technology, equipment and awareness. So the main concern is to detect brain related diseases at early stages so that it does not spread into vital parts of brain and disrupt body functions. Also, more precise and accurate technologies are required to serve as aid in diagnosis, treatment and surgery of brain. Therefore, its high alarming time to monitor mortality statistics and develop faster and accurate methods to curb the situation by simulating tissue deformation and locating cancerous nodes which is a good area of research. A brain tumor is used to design the deformation model. Early stage detection of tumors is difficult from images. Moreover, the accuracy involved is less. Keeping all this into consideration, a machine learning approach has been developed to detect and model tissue deformation with classification of soft and hard tissues so that the tissues having risk of future problem can also be recognized. The machine learning is the approach which learns from the existing patterns and derives new patterns based on their input parameters.

The deluge of IoT data creates enormous opportunities for us to explore the physical world, especially with the help of deep learning techniques. Traditionally, the Cloud is the option for deploying deep learning based applications. However, the challenges of Cloud-centric IoT systems are increasing due to significant data movement overhead, escalating energy needs, and privacy issues. Rather than constantly moving a tremendous amount of raw data to the Cloud, it would be beneficial to leverage the emerging powerful IoT devices to perform the inference task. Nevertheless, the statically trained model could not efficiently handle the dynamic data in the real in-situ environments, which leads to low accuracy. Moreover, the big raw IoT data challenges the traditional supervised training method in the Cloud. To tackle the above challenges, we propose In-situ AI, the first Autonomous and Incremental computing framework and architecture for deep learning based IoT applications. We equip deep learning based IoT system with autonomous IoT data diagnosis (minimize data movement), and incremental and unsupervised training method (tackle the big raw IoT data generated in ever-changing in-situ environments). To provide efficient architectural support for this new computing paradigm, we first characterize the two In-situ AI tasks (i.e. inference and diagnosis tasks) on two popular IoT devices (i.e. mobile GPU and FPGA) and explore the design space and tradeoffs. Based on the characterization results, we propose two working modes for the In-situ AI tasks, including Single-running and Co-running modes. Moreover, we craft analytical models for these two modes to guide the best configuration selection. We also develop a novel two-level weight shared In-situ AI architecture to efficiently deploy In-situ tasks to IoT node.

The development of intelligent early-warning systems of dam safety (IEWSDS) is a significant approach to realize above aim. This paper regarded dam as a vital and intelligent system, thereby constructed a bionics model of dam safety, which consisted of sensing system (nerve), central processing unit (cerebrum) and decision-making implement (organism). With above model and systems engineering, this paper designed an IEWSDS, which was composed of integration control, intelligent inference machine, project database, model base, graphics base and input/output modules. In the system, metadata base based on object oriented data model was used to implement the integration of homogeneous or nonhomogeneous databases storing dam safety data from different information sources. The multilevel link style was adopted to manage model base. Intelligent inference machine is the central processing unit of IEWSDS implementing data analysis, abnormality diagnosis and evaluation for dam safety. Because of strong non-linear and dynamic characteristics, the system adopted a combination model based on wavelet networks to approximate and forecast the run characteristics of dam. The abnormality diagnosis is a process of discovering knowledge on the pattern between of disease and geneses. The methods of attributions reduction in rough sets theory were presented to diagnose adaptively the abnormal cases and find out the geneses. The safety status of dam changes dynamically, which emerges in the quantitative and qualitative change manners. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative changes need be considered comprehensively in the process of dam safety evaluation. This paper proposed an extension evaluation method. The quantitative change and qualitative change of dam safety property were integrated into a matter-element. Based on the matter-element extensibility, the contradictory problem for dam safety elevation can be solved. In practice, the proposed system has been used to monitor dam safety successfully.

The joint algorithm combines the advantages of the fuzzy clustering algorithm and of the self-learning algorithm; the fuzzy clustering algorithm has been widely applied in fault diagnosis of conventional mechanical systems, but is difficult to be applied for the fault diagnosis of railway vehicle running gears in the specific track-vehicle environment, due to the track irregularities. When combined with the self-learning algorithm, the new joint algorithm converts original featured values into clustering series as new judgement criteria by clustering samples in the same section, and then obtains the dynamic early warning threshold to realize the vibration monitoring and early warning of the railway vehicle running gear. A mechanical vibration test rig was built to verify the new joint algorithm. A monitoring and early warning software platform based on the joint algorithm was also developed to monitor and early warn the abnormal vibrations of the railway vehicle in real time. The experimental results show that the new method can efficiently identify the abnormal vibrations in the case of mechanical failure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8749115/,2018 24th International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC),6-7 Sept. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Previous studies mainly focus on QoS (Quality of Service) based anomaly detection and root cause analysis, but the cellular network operators pay more attention to the userâ€™s QoE (Quality of Experience) degradation since QoE can better represent the userâ€™s actual service experience. To achieve online QoE anomaly detection and root cause analysis, in this paper, we present a new integrated anomaly detection and diagnosis framework. Firstly, QoE is expressed by the KQIs (Key Quality Indicators) vector of the userâ€™s three most common services with largest traffic. And then, QoE anomaly detection is processed by using two-step clustering method (SOM+K-mediods) to obtain QoE Anomaly Codebooks. Diagnosis is achieved by selecting KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and learning their characteristic impact on KQIs to obtain Fault Cause Codebooks. The QoE Anomaly Codebooks are used to detect anomaly samples, and the Fault Cause Codebooks are applied to find the fault cause types. The designed framework has been evaluated with real 4G data. For comparison, three other two- step clustering algorithms are introduced, and results show that our framework can achieve the highest detection accuracy rate. Therefore, it can be directly used in real-world cellular networks for online fault detection and diagnosis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9024618/,2019 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps),9-13 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

High quality diagnosis results, measured in terms of accuracy and resolution, are crucial for physical failure analysis during fast yield ramping. Despite various existing methods for enhancing diagnosis, there is still ample room for further improvement. In this paper, a new machine learning based diagnosis method is proposed for improving both accuracy and resolution. Based on features extracted from tester and simulation data, the goal is to predict whether a defect candidate actually corresponds to the real defect. Specifically, semi-supervised learning is deployed to use unlabeled data to augment model training. In addition, a defect-level learning procedure uses characteristics from similar defects to further improve resolution. Experiments involving virtual and silicon datasets demonstrate significant improvements that include: 6.4× increase in occurrences of perfect diagnosis, and a performance that consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art diagnosis techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325212/,2020 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC),1-6 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Precise calibration lies at the core of a variety of applications, due to the need to accurately perceive the world. However, while a lot of work has focused on calibrating the sensors, not much has been done towards identifying when a sensor needs to be recalibrated.

On the other hand, this paper takes ARM Cortex M4 and BLE 5.0 as the solution for data transmitting and encoding. All the above circuits are integrated into one PCB, and the prototype is designed by 3D-printer. The whole ECG Patch's size is 86.6 mm* 50 mm* 20 mm. The software system includes an application (APP) with DT algorithms, a cloud server is available to execute DT training and to provide a user interface for supporting telemedicine. This paper proposes a simplified DT model, which can be realized in APP based on iOS system.

Feature selection is one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure.

The proposed method implements transfer learning based on the ResNet50 CNN, pretrained using the ImageNet dataset. Datasets from the ISIC Archive were implemented during training, validation and testing. Further tests were performed on a smaller dataset of images taken from the Dermnet NZ website and from recent clinical cases still awaiting histological results to indicate the trained network's ability to generalise to real cases. The 86% test accuracy achieved with the proposed method was comparable to the results of prior studies but required significantly less pre-processing actions to classify a lesion and was not dependant on consistent image scaling or the presence of a scale on the image.

Considering the criticality, finance, and time involved in repair, periodic condition monitoring and maintenance of transformers are the key to ensure electrical safety as well as stable operation of the large interconnected power system. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is an established tool used to determine the incipient faults within the transformer by analyzing the concentration of different gases in the transformer oil and giving early warnings and diagnoses. Currently, transformers worldwide utilise online sensors to monitor dissolved gases and moisture content in oil. The online DGA sensor uses a small amount of oil from transformer to perform real-time DGA analysis and gives the ppm content of dissolved gases for further course of action. Considering the large quantity of assets and the huge amount of data produced, it is imperative to develop a tool to aid the operators in assimilating the available data for diagnosis and proactive decision making. The present study improvises AI techniques to predict future dissolved gas concentrations using real time DGA data collected from the transmission utility of the country. The prediction helps to forecast the trend of development of incipient faults in the transformer. The complete project scope is to develop a highly reliable diagnostic tool to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in transformer DGA analysis to enhance transformer life. In the present paper, models based on Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Vector Auto Regression (VAR) are implemented to predict DGA data of three in-service transformers. DGA data is forecasted for up to 8 monthly samples in the future, and the accuracy of results is compared with each other.

In this paper, we compare the performance of the 1D CNN and 2D CNN for the multi-class classification of time-series sensor data. The architecture of each CNN considered in this work has a single convolutional layer and one fully connected layer. Real measured data are used for the training and testing of the models. 1D signal extracted from sensor signal is converted into 2D data array for the input of the 2D CNN.

The time series obtained from the decomposition, covering different frequency ranges, will be randomly shuffled and combined to generate new artificial samples for each group. Then, both the generated artificial samples and part of the real samples will be used to train the LSTM network, and the remaining original samples will be used to test the model.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can measure the blood chromophores noninvasively for early diagnosis, and frequent examination, which are vital in case of brain degeneration. We present the development and functioning of our lab-developed fNIRS system. It provides a real-time display of variation in blood chromophores related to neuronal activation. It employs 128 dual-wavelength LEDs of 735 nm and 850 nm. The selection of these wavelengths allows computation of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). A single photosensor is used in the presented device.

People with LBP show altered trunk muscle activity and enhanced fatigability of trunk muscles is associated with the development and future risk of LBP. Therefore, a system that can forecast trunk muscle activity and detect fatigue can help subjects, practitioners and physiotherapists in the diagnosis, monitoring and recovery of LBP. In this paper, we present a novel approach in order to determine whether subjects are fatigued, or transitioning to fatigue, 25 seconds ahead of time using surface Electromyography (sEMG) from 14 trunk muscles. This is achieved using a three-step approach: A) extracting features related to fatigue from sEMG, B) forecasting the features using a real-time adaptive filter and C) performing dimensionality reduction (from 70 to 2 features) and then classifying subjects using a supervised machine learning algorithm.

In particular, formulating the respiration monitoring process as a 3D space-time volumetric representation, we introduce a real-time surface reconstruction algorithm to generate omni-direction deformation states of a patient's chest while breathing, which reflects the change in tidal volume over time. These deformation states are then used to estimate breathing volume through a per-patient correlation metric acquired through a Bayesian-network learning process.

Within the presented framework, the fault is detected by a model-based method using self-recurrent wavelet neural network. Afterward, a semi-supervised fuzzy clustering technique is applied to locate the failed switch while multiresolution wavelet analysis is used for feature extraction. Presented method offers the ability to detect the fault online and minimizes the isolation time without deploying extra hardware. In comparison with supervised classifiers to locate the failed switches, the proposed scheme requires significantly fewer data collected under fault operation to train the clustering model. The developed scheme has been validated by different fault scenarios on MATLAB simulations as well as on a lab prototype including a five-phase induction motor fed by a 3-level 5-phase neutral point clamped inverter.

However their on-site application is a rather difficult task because PD information is widely superimposed with electromagnetic disturbances. These disturbances affect very negatively all known PD diagnosis systems. Especially the detection and suppression of stochastic pulse shaped noise is a major problem. To determine such noise a fast machine intelligent signal recognition system (NeuroTEK II) was developed. This system is able to distinguish between PD pulses and noise up to a signal to noise ratio of 1:10. Therefore a measuring system acquires the input data in the VHF range (20..100MHz). The discrimination of the pulses is performed in real time in time domain using fast neural network hardware.

The equipment can be by video camera recording, machine vision systems and force plates. Motion analysis systems supported by multi-camera machine vision systems are an expensive solution for many applications. Force plates are another measurement tool that can be used in conjunction with a machine vision system or as a separate system. In the case of the latter set-up, the force plate is able to measure the centroid and vector of the ground reaction force, and the data retrieved can be interpreted by clinical staff to determine the nature of balance or stance of a patient. There is valuable information in the transients that can be detected by this approach, however the force plate cannot be utilised to discriminate other spatial factors in the way that the loads are applied by the patient on the surface. This paper reports the distributive approach to tactile sensing applied to infer the 3 dimensional motion of a moving mass in a supporting mechanism placed on the 2 dimensional sensing surface. The distributive approach has the advantage over forceplates on constructional costs and the ability to discriminate many motion metrics of patients. Implementation of the system using only three low cost deflection sensing elements, positioned under the surface with the resulting signals interpreted by neural network implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) output near real time sampling rates greater than 70 KHz.

Robust, automatic AF detection in clinics remains challenging. Deep learning has emerged as an effective tool for handling complex data analysis with minimal pre- and post-processing. A 16-layer 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed to classify the ECGs including AF. One of the key advances of the proposed CNN was that skip connections were employed to enhance the rate of information transfer throughout the network by connecting layers earlier in the network with layers later in the network. Skip connections led to a significant increase in the feature learning capabilities of the CNN as well as speeding up the training time. For comparisons, we also have implemented recurrent neural networks (RNN) and spectrogram learning. The CNN was trained on 8,528 ECGs and tested on 3,685 ECGs ranging from 9 to 60 seconds in length.

In theory, the dry-type air core reactor with multi strand parallel winding can effectively avoid the occurrence of inter turn short circuit fault, but there are still faults in the actual operation, so there is a lack of research on the inter strand short circuit fault of the reactor. In order to study the influence of inter strand short circuit fault on reactor, a field circuit coupling finite element simulation model was established to simulate the spatial magnetic field and current distribution characteristics of reactor under normal operation and inter strand short circuit fault. The results show that the working state of the reactor hardly changes when the same turn inter strand short circuit fault occurs; the different turn inter strand short circuit fault will significantly affect the space magnetic field near the short circuit turn, and the closer the short circuit point is to the end, the more serious the fault is; the different turn inter strand short circuit fault will significantly change the current of the reactor, especially the real part current. The research work fully reveals the change of operation characteristics of reactor under inter strand short circuit fault, and provides a reference for the occurrence and diagnosis of reactor fault.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9836889/,2022 IEEE 10th Joint International Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC),17-19 June 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The failures of the power transformer impact critically the grid, can cause energy loss and blackouts. In energy production, transmission, distribution, and industrial applications, the oil immersed power transformer is the most used. The maintenance of this key equipment is highly important which can be done with different techniques such as thermal and vibration analysis, frequency analysis using wavelet transform and dissolved gas analysis. The application of predictive maintenance of the power transformer represents an important feature of the Smart Energy Management System in micro grids, that can reduce the percentage of failure occurrence while increasing the availability of the power transformer and prevents blackouts.

This paper proposes a new statistical method combined with a simple classification algorithm that can discriminate epileptic EEG signals from normal signals. The statistical method extracts most significant spectral features by maximizing statistical distance between the epileptic and the normal power spectrums. The power spectrum density of EEG signals is estimated by the multi-taper method. A linear algorithm based on the Fisher discriminant analysis classifies the selected spectral features as either the epileptic or the normal class from the EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that our method could reach >99.6% classification accuracy while its computational complexity appears to be much lower than the previously proposed methods that exhibited similar classification performances. It is suggested that our method may be readily implemented in real time with high accuracy so that it can provide an on-line monitoring tool for clinical epilepsy diagnosis.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5580709/,2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics,11-14 July 2010,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Doctors screen for sarcopenia by observing patients&#x2019; habitual gait features without quantification and the performance of gait disturbances differ in various people that are considered to be sarcopenic, which is an important basis along with reduced physical functioning for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Such a subjective diagnosis has been seen as a problem because diagnostic results may differ among doctors and factors such as fatigue may affect diagnosis. To strengthen and aid the use of these observations, we built a novel automatic deep learning model based on random forest for real-time human body joint detection coupled with a modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to recognize gait features for further clinical analysis. Aligned with the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) [1] aims, our goal is to facilitate the implementation of standardized sarcopenia diagnosis in clinical practice by providing an automatic gait analysis system.

10.1109/ITC50571.2021.00028,Triplet Convolutional Networks for Classifying Mixed-Type WBM Patterns with Noisy Labels,IEEE,Conferences,"Wafer Bin Maps (WBM) frequently show various spatial failure patterns that provide crucial information for engineers to identify the root cause of failures and their consequent low yield. To shorten the root-cause diagnosis process, it is important to classify different failure patterns with high accuracy, especially when there is mixed type of failure patterns on the same wafer. The main challenges of mixed type classification in WBMs include: 1) Lack of accurately annotated real-world training dataset, 2) Imbalanced/long-tail distributions among classes, 3) Synthesized training data usually cannot reflect the practical application conditions. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised learning approach and use an ensemble method based on triplet CNN models to classify mixed-type failure patterns in WBMs. We train the models based on the public WM-811K dataset, which is collected from real products but with only single-label annotations. We demonstrate that such models could mitigate the imbalanced class distribution and being able to learn efficiently from a weakly labeled dataset and achieve superior performances on the classification of real wafer maps with long-tail distributed mixed type failures.

10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2832648,A Cost-Sensitive Deep Belief Network for Imbalanced Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Imbalanced data with a skewed class distribution are common in many real-world applications. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning technique that is effective in classification tasks. However, conventional DBN does not work well for imbalanced data classification because it assumes equal costs for each class. To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches assign different misclassification costs for different classes without disrupting the true data sample distributions. However, due to lack of prior knowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard to choose in practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive learning could improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for imbalanced classification. ECS-DBN uses adaptive differential evolution to optimize the misclassification costs based on the training data that presents an effective approach to incorporating the evaluation measure (i.e., G-mean) into the objective function. We first optimize the misclassification costs, and then apply them to DBN. Adaptive differential evolution optimization is implemented as the optimization algorithm that automatically updates its corresponding parameters without the need of prior domain knowledge. The experiments have shown that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on both benchmark data sets and real-world data set for fault diagnosis in tool condition monitoring.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8368071/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Jan. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The digital revolution has transformed the manufacturing industry into smart manufacturing through the development of intelligent systems. In this paper, a big data ecosystem is presented for the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis in predictive maintenance with real industrial big data gathered directly from large-scale global manufacturing plants, aiming to provide a complete architecture which could be used in industrial IoT-based smart manufacturing in an industrial 4.0 system. The proposed architecture overcomes multiple challenges including big data ingestion, integration, transformation, storage, analytics, and visualization in a real-time environment using various technologies such as the data lake, NoSQL database, Apache Spark, Apache Drill, Apache Hive, OPC Collector, and other techniques. Transformation protocols, authentication, and data encryption methods are also utilized to address data and network security issues. A MapReduce-based distributed PCA model is designed for fault detection and diagnosis. In a large-scale manufacturing system, not all kinds of failure data are accessible, and the absence of labels precludes all the supervised methods in the predictive phase. Furthermore, the proposed framework takes advantage of some of the characteristics of PCA such as its ease of implementation on Spark, its simple algorithmic structure, and its real-time processing ability. All these elements are essential for smart manufacturing in the evolution to Industry 4.0.

Due to the limited data, existing models suffer from incapable feature extraction and poor network convergence and optimization. Accordingly, a multi-stage residual network, MSRCovXNet, is proposed for effective detection of COVID-19 from chest x-ray (CXR) images. As a shallow yet effective classifier with the ResNet-18 as the feature extractor, MSRCovXNet is optimized by fusing two proposed feature enhancement modules (FEM), i.e., low-level and high-level feature maps (LLFMs and HLFMs), which contain respectively more local information and rich semantic information, respectively. For effective fusion of these two features, a single-stage FEM (MSFEM) and a multi-stage FEM (MSFEM) are proposed to enhance the semantic feature representation of the LLFMs and the local feature representation of the HLFMs, respectively. Without ensembling other deep learning models, our MSRCovXNet has a precision of 98.9&#x0025; and a recall of 94&#x0025; in detection of COVID-19, which outperforms several state-of-the-art models.

Then, some well-trained prediction models are used to construct a global view of a radio environment, namely, radio environment map (REM), for diagnosis and management purposes. Moreover, REMs enable operators to detect existing coverage and capacity problems at any interested location. To verify the feasibility of indoor diagnoses, we collect a real trace data from an indoor testbed and then conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the machine-learning algorithms in terms of the accuracy, the time complexity, and the sensitivity to data volumes. The experimental results provide an insightful guideline to the indoor deployment of small cells in cellular-based IoT networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8643780/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,June 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we present a novel real-time machine learning system for Arrhythmia classification. The system is based on the parallel Delta modulation and QRS/PT wave detection algorithms. We propose a patient dependent rotated linear-kernel support vector machine classifier that combines the global and local classifiers, with three types of feature vectors extracted directly from the Delta modulated bit-streams. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. According to the AAMI standard, two binary classifications are performed and evaluated, which are supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) versus the rest four classes, and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) versus the rest. For SVEB classification, the preferred SkP-32 method's F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity value are 0.83, 79.3%, 99.6%, and 88.2%, respectively, and for VEB classification, the numbers are 0.92%, 92.8%, 99.4%, and 91.6%, respectively.

10.1109/TNSM.2019.2917271,A Semantic-Based Policy Analysis Solution for the Deployment of NFV Services,IEEE,Journals,"Policies in network function virtualization (NFV) systems may conflict when they have different restrictions on the shared resources. In this context, it is of paramount importance to identify such conflicts before sending network service (NS) request (NS-Req) to the embedding algorithm to avoid unexpected behavior in its execution. Since both NS-Req and NFV infrastructure (NFVI) may contain many policies, the process of conflict detection and diagnosis is an intricate work both for humans and computer systems. Besides, as conflicts may occur among a set of constraints, pairwise detection will not suffice. Therefore, this paper proposes NSChecker, a semantic verification system to detect and diagnose policy conflicts in NFV environments. To achieve its functionality, NSChecker uses an ontology, called Onto-NFV, to describe the NFVI, NS, and associated policies. With Onto-NFV, conflicts detection is carried out through description logic (DL) inconsistency verification. We develop a prototype of NSChecker in Java and validate its capabilities on a small scenario with three use cases, showing that it supports conflict detection concerning the following policies: network function precedence, resource usage, and location. Finally, we evaluate NSChecker performance using some real topologies. The results shows that our solution is efficient even in scenarios with 50 000 nodes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8716553/,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It holds an important place in theory and practice, because a huge number of real-world problems, such as timetabling, planning, routing, bioinformatics, fault diagnosis, etc., could be encoded into it. Stochastic local search (SLS) methods can solve many real-world problems that often involve large-scale instances at reasonable computation costs while delivering good-quality solutions. In this work, we propose a novel SLS algorithm called adaptive variable depth SLS for PMSAT problem solving based on a dynamic local search framework. Our algorithm exploits two algorithmic components of an SLS method: parameter tuning and neighborhood search. Our first contribution is the design of an adaptive parameter tuner that searches for the best parameter setting for each instance by considering its features. The second contribution is a variable depth neighborhood search (VDS) algorithm adopted for PMSAT problem, which our empirical evaluation proves is a more efficient w.r.t. single neighborhood search. We conducted our experiments on the PMSAT benchmarks from MaxSAT Evaluation 2014 to 2019, including more than 3600 instances which have been encoded from a broad range of domains such as verification, optimization, graph theory, automated-reasoning, pseudo Boolean, etc. Our experimental evaluation results show that AVD-SLS solver, which is implemented based on our algorithm, outperforms state-of-the-art PMSAT SLS solvers in most benchmark classes, including random, crafted, and industrial instances. Furthermore, AVD-SLS reports remarkably better results on weighted benchmark, and shows competitive results with several well-known hybrid PMSAT solvers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9386095/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology breaks the tight coupling between the control plane and the data plane in the traditional network architecture, making the controllability, security, and economy of network resources into a reality. As one of the important actualization methods of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), combined with SDN architecture will have great potential in areas, such as network resource management, route planning, traffic scheduling, fault diagnosis, and network security.

From the perspective of ML algorithms, this paper focuses on the applications of classical ML algorithms in SDN-based networks, after a characteristic analysis of algorithms. From the other perspective, after classifying the existing network applications based on the SDN architecture, the related ML solutions are introduced. Finally, the future development of the ML algorithms and SDN concepts is discussed and analyzed. This paper occupies the intersection of the AI, big data, computer networking, and other disciplines; the AI itself is a new and complex interdisciplinary field, which causes the researchers in this field to often have different professional backgrounds and, sometimes, divergent research purposes.

To fight against the disease, a series of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are developed and applied to real-world scenarios such as safety monitoring, disease diagnosis, infection risk assessment, and lesion segmentation of COVID-19 CT scans. The coronavirus epidemics have forced people wear masks to counteract the transmission of virus, which also brings difficulties to monitor large groups of people wearing masks. In this article, we primarily focus on the AI techniques of masked facial detection and related datasets. We survey the recent advances, beginning with the descriptions of masked facial detection datasets. A total of 13 available datasets are described and discussed in detail. Then, the methods are roughly categorized into two classes: conventional methods and neural network-based methods. The conventional methods are usually trained by boosting algorithms with hand-crafted features, which accounts for a small proportion. Neural network-based methods are further classified as three parts according to the number of processing stages. Representative algorithms are described in detail, coupled with some typical techniques that are described briefly. Finally, we summarize the recent benchmarking results, give the discussions on the limitations of datasets and methods, and expand future research directions.

Cardiac arrhythmia is a very common type of CVD and may indicate an increased risk of stroke or sudden cardiac death. The ECG is the most widely adopted clinical tool to diagnose and assess the risk of arrhythmia. ECGs measure and display the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. During patients' hospital visits, however, arrhythmias may not be detected on standard resting ECG machines, since the condition may not be present at that moment in time. While Holter-based portable monitoring solutions offer 24-48 h ECG recording, they lack the capability of providing any real-time feedback for the thousands of heart beats they record, which must be tediously analyzed offline. In this paper, we seek to unite the portability of Holter monitors and the real-time processing capability of state-of-the-art resting ECG machines to provide an assistive diagnosis solution using smartphones. Specifically, we developed two smartphone-based wearable CVD-detection platforms capable of performing real-time ECG acquisition and display, feature extraction, and beat classification.

However, the accurate performance of deep learning depends on the tuning of many hyperparameters and a large amount of labeled data. This COVID-19 data bottleneck also leads to insufficient human resources for data labeling, which presents a challenging obstacle. In this paper, a novel discriminative batch-mode active learning (DS3) is proposed to allow faster and more effective COVID-19 data annotation. The framework specifically designed to suit the imbalanced data phenomenon that is characteristic of COVID-19 data. Extensive experiments over four public real-world COVID-19 datasets from several countries such as Brazil, China, Israel and Mexico show that our active learning framework significantly outmatches other state-of-the-art models.

However, the volume and fast changing behavior of metric streams have rendered it a challenging task. Many diagnosis frameworks often rely on thresholding with stationarity or normality assumption, or on complex models requiring extensive offline training. Such techniques are known to be prone to spurious false-alarms in online settings as metric streams undergo rapid contextual changes from known baselines. Hence, we propose two unsupervised incremental techniques following a two-step strategy. First, we estimate an underlying temporal property of the stream via adaptive learning and, then we apply statistically robust control charts to recognize deviations. We evaluated our techniques by replaying over 40 time-series streams from the Yahoo! Webscope S5 datasets as well as four other traces of real Web service QoS and ISP traffic measurements.

However their on-site application is a rather difficult task as PD information is generally superimposed with electromagnetic disturbances. These disturbances affect negatively all known PD evaluation systems. Especially the detection and suppression of stochastically distributed pulse shaped disturbances is a major problem. To determine such disturbances fast machine intelligent recognition systems are being developed. Three different strategies based on digital signal processing are discussed in this paper, while focusing on time resolved neural signal recognition. The system investigated more closely is currently able to distinguish between PD pulses and disturbances with the disturbances values being ten times higher than the peak values of the PD pulses. Therefore a measuring system acquires the input data in the VHF range (20-100 MHz). The discrimination of the pulses is performed in real time in time domain using fast neural network hardware. With that signal recognition system a noise reassessed phase resolved pulse sequence (PRPS) data set in the CIGRE data format is generated that can be the input source of most PD evaluation software.

Most of the current seizure detection approaches strongly rely on patient history records and thus fail in the patient-independent situation of detecting the new patients. To overcome such limitation, we propose a robust and explainable epileptic seizure detection model that effectively learns from seizure states while eliminates the inter-patient noises. A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals through adversarial training. Furthermore, to enhance the explainability, we develop an attention mechanism to automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure diagnosis procedure. The proposed approach is evaluated over the Temple University Hospital EEG (TUH EEG) database. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines with low latency.

One of the main challenges in monitoring these degradation phenomena is to adequately measure a statistically significant number of signals from each of the sources acting on the asset under test. However, in industrial environments the presence of large amplitude noise sources or the simultaneous presence of multiple PD sources may limit the acquisition of the signals and therefore the final diagnosis of the equipment status may not be the most accurate. Although different procedures and separation and identification techniques have been implemented with very good results, not having a significant number of PD pulses associated with each source can limit the effectiveness of these procedures. Based on the above, this research proposes a new algorithm of artificial generation of PD based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) architecture which allows artificially generating different sources of PD from a small group of real PD, in order to complement those sources that during the measurement were poorly represented in terms of signals.

The aim of this paper is to reduce user variability in data acquisition by automatically computing a score of echo quality for operator feedback. To do this, a deep convolutional neural network model, trained on a large set of samples, was developed for scoring apical four-chamber (A4C) echo. In this paper, 6,916 end-systolic echo images were manually studied by an expert cardiologist and were assigned a score between 0 (not acceptable) and 5 (excellent). The images were divided into two independent training-validation and test sets. The network architecture and its parameters were based on the stochastic approach of the particle swarm optimization on the training-validation data. The mean absolute error between the scores from the ultimately trained model and the expert's manual scores was 0.71 ± 0.58. The reported error was comparable to the measured intra-rater reliability. The learned features of the network were visually interpretable and could be mapped to the anatomy of the heart in the A4C echo, giving confidence in the training result. The computation time for the proposed network architecture, running on a graphics processing unit, was less than 10 ms per frame, sufficient for real-time deployment.

10.1109/TVT.2021.3092354,CAN-D: A Modular Four-Step Pipeline for Comprehensively Decoding Controller Area Network Data,IEEE,Journals,"Controller area networks (CANs) are a broadcast protocol for real-time communication of critical vehicle subsystems. Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers—both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios—and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a $>$ 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal that is also the state of the art. In evaluation on 10 vehicles of different makes, CAN-D's average $\ell ^1$ error is five times better (81% less) than all previous methods and exhibits lower average error, even when considering only signals that meet prior methods’ assumptions.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3098799,Cost-Based Heterogeneous Learning Framework for Real-Time Spam Detection in Social Networks With Expert Decisions,IEEE,Journals,"With the widespread use of social networks, spam messages against them have become a major issue. Spam detection methods can be broadly divided into expert-based and machine learning-based detection methods. When experts participate in spam detection, the detection accuracy is fairly high. However, this method is highly time-consuming and expensive. Conversely, methods using machine learning have the advantage of automation, but their accuracy is relatively low. This paper proposes a spam-detection framework that combines and fully exploits the advantages of both methods. To reduce the workload of the experts, all messages are first analyzed via a primary machine learning filter, and those that are determined to be normal messages are allowed through, whereas suspicious messages are flagged. The flagged messages are subsequently analyzed by an expert to enhance the overall system accuracy. In the filtering process, cost-based machine learning is used to prevent the fatal error of misidentifying a spam message as a normal message. In addition, to obviate the continuously evolving spam trends, a module that periodically updates the expert-diagnosis results on the training dataset is incorporated into the framework. The results of experiments conducted, on an imbalanced dataset of spam tweets and normal tweets in a ratio similar to the actual situation in real life, indicate that the proposed framework has a spam-detection rate of almost 92.8%, which is higher than that of the conventional machine learning technique.

Although the use of data-driven fault detection techniques have gained much interest, the main deterrent in using these approaches in detecting ITSC faults is in the generalization and robustness of the diagnosis. In this paper, a data-driven on-line fault detection framework, incorporated with multi-feature extraction/selection and multi-classifier ensemble is proposed, capable of detecting ITSC faults in induction motors (IMs) that subjected to variable operating conditions. By using the synchronous time series signals collected from the machines, multiple feature extraction/selection is explored to find the sensitive faulty features, and the different types of classification strategies is used to increase the diversity of single based models. With the increased diversity of the base learners, the fault detection accuracy is expected to be enhanced and the robustness can be guaranteed.

The proposed process is based on pixel neighborhood analysis using only simple arithmetic operations on the image files. This leads to an optimization of the processing speed of the produced image. A first step in the process is to identify and locate the defective pixels on the image. Three defective pixel detection algorithms are proposed. The first one uses the distance between the pixel under test and its neighboring pixels. The second method is based on the median value of the pixel block around each pixel. The third method uses an evaluation and analysis of the local dispersion parameters in the image. The concealment of detected defective pixels is the second step of the self-healing process of image sensor. It consists of substituting the defective value by the median value of the neighborhood pixel block. In the study and learning phase, distorted images obtained by injecting random disturbances into healthy reference images are used to evaluate the defective pixel detection and concealment methods. The set of $1 176$ distorted images is constructed using 196 reference images with six types of defects, based on typical failure mechanism of image sensors. The proposed methods are compared to different state-of-the-art defective pixel detection and correction methods, in both software and FPGA implementations.

This approach is helpful not only to formulate individualized diagnosis schemes, but also to understand the pathogenesis of diseases. Many studies have focused on enhancing the prediction performance using explicit side information, such as miRNA functional similarity and disease semantic similarity. The existing approaches, however, often ignore the higher-order implicit proximity among miRNAs and diseases. To this end, in this paper, we first propose a novel approach HOP_MDA (<u>H</u>igher-<u>O</u>rder <u>P</u>roximity based <u>M</u>iRNA and <u>D</u>isease <u>A</u>ssociation Prediction) for predicting potential association between miRNA and disease. Both explicit interaction information and implicit higher-order proximity information between miRNA and disease are encoded with different order proximity matrices which are weightily combined into a parameterized prediction matrix. A supervised learning approach based on the known miRNAs-disease associations is proposed to determine the optimal weight parameters. The prediction matrix is then used to achieve effective prediction. Additionally, a higher-order proximity approximation technique (HOPA_MDA) is presented to make more efficient predictions. 5-fold cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The average AUC values of HOPA_MDA for two real datasets are 0.921+/-0.002 and 0.944+/-0.0015, respectively.

The system-on-package (SOP) approach has been identified as a key strategy for integrating these strategic packaging technologies. Because of rising costs, the challenge before SOP manufacturers is to offset capital investment with greater automation and technological innovation in the fabrication process. To reduce manufacturing cost, several important subtasks have emerged, including increasing fabrication yield, reducing product cycle time, maintaining consistent levels of product quality and performance, and improving the reliability of processing equipment. Because of the large number of steps involved, maintaining product quality in an SOP manufacturing facility requires the control of hundreds of process variables.

However, deep learning-based approaches are computationally expensive and have huge parameters, which makes them less affordable for edge devices. In order to make them affordable for edge devices, the whole classification model needs to be compressed while maintaining accuracy. Providing a low-cost solution for histopathological diagnosis in the recent edge-computing world is of utmost importance. Therefore, in this study, we propose “MobiHisNet,” an efficient and lightweight CNN model for histopathological image classification (HIC) based on MobileNet. MobiHisNet was successfully deployed on a Raspberry Pi, as well as three mobile devices, demonstrating its ability to run on a lightweight and portable processor. Our studies indicated that a depth parameter ( $\gamma = 0.5$ ) and a 16-bit quantization are the optimum parameters for the proposed model while balancing the accuracy, inference time, and memory peak requirements. Compared to the state-of-the-art, pretrained models, MobiHisNet has fewer parameters and calculations, resulting in faster image classification. This renders it more viable for production purposes and applications on edge devices. In addition, MobiHisNet is computationally faster than VGG16, ResNet50, Xception, and InceptionV3 by twenty-seven, eight, six, and five times, respectively. This also outperforms all the baseline models with the moderate model size and FLOP counts.

One of the most common is associated with the optimization algorithm used to train them. The most commonly used training method is stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation (or backpropagation for short) because it is mathematically tractable (given that the activation functions are differentiable). However, backpropagation is not guaranteed to find the globally optimal set of weights and biases. As a result, the MLP is often incapable of obtaining a desirable solution to the problem. Clonal selection algorithms (CSA) are optimization procedures that effectively explore a complex and large space to find values near the global optimum. Consequently, CSA can be used to solve the problem of training MLP networks. This paper presents a novel implementation of CSA for training MLP architectures to solve real-world problems such as breast cancer diagnosis, active sonar target classification, wheat classification, and flower classification. The CSA is used to find the optimal weights and biases that will significantly increase the classification accuracy of the MLP. The performance of our proposed approach is compared with other popular training methods: genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Harris hawks optimization (HHO), moth-flame optimization (MFO), flower pollination algorithm (FPA), and backpropagation (BP). The comparison is benchmarked using five classification datasets: Iris Flower, Sonar, Wheat Seeds, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Haberman&#x2019;s Survival.

The proposed framework comprises three stages namely; feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and GA optimized AIS. In the first stage, signal processing methods are applied to extract multidomain features (time-domain statistical, frequency domain statistical, and special features) of the system. In the second stage, two unsupervised methods namely, k-NN clustering and pretraining using deep learning neural network are proposed for dominant fault-characterizing feature selection. Finally, in the third stage, the fault-characterizing feature vectors are used for system status categorization (i.e., normal, fault) using selected (fault-characterizing) features-based AIS method. The efficacy of the proposed framework is verified through experiments on motor bearing fault detection using vibration signal.

However, loss of sensor readings due to sensor abnormalities and/or malfunction of connectors has long been a hurdle to reliable fault diagnosis and prognosis in multichannel CM systems. The problem becomes more challenging when the sensor channels are not synchronized because of different sampling rates used and/or time-varying operational schemes. This paper provides a nonparametric sensor recovery technique and a semi-parametric alternative to enhance the robustness of multichannel CM systems. Based on historical data, models for all the sensor signals are constructed using functional principal component analysis (FPCA), and functional regression (FR) models are developed for those correlated signals. These models with parameters updated in online implementation can be used to recover the lost sensor signals.

Over the years, PoCUS services are adopted in resource-limited settings for faster and useful outcomes. For a cost-effective and power-efficient solution, a smartphone-based portable continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound (US) system has been developed for diagnosing peripheral arterial diseases based on the hemodynamic feature values. The proposed system includes the analog front end (AFE), signal processing and display unit (SPDU), and smartphone application. The AFE acquires blood flow signal from the brachial artery using an 8-MHz pencil probe, extracts the Doppler shift frequency, and transfers to the SPDU through 12-bit analog-to-digital converter. To provide an area and power-efficient solution, SPDU is embedded in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based single chip. A COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC)-based custom-designed 512-point fast Fourier transform is implemented in that FPGA for displaying the blood flow spectrogram in real time. For back-end processing, the smartphone application receives a spectrogram through Bluetooth, removes noise, extracts hemodynamic features, and diagnoses using a machine learning framework. The device has been examined on 18 volunteers (normal: 17 and abnormal: 1), while the accuracy is found to be 94% in the pretrained support vector machine classifier. For validation, the spectrogram of the normal and abnormal subjects and parameter values are compared with the commercial device. Overall, the handheld device is minimally trained operator-dependent and consumes <; 4 W of power for real-time processing. Such smartphone-based feature extraction and automated diagnosis can facilitate the point-of-care system and provide a baseline for early assessment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9064842/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/JSEN.2019.2921862,Speed of Sound-Based Capnographic Sensor With Second-Generation CNN for Automated Classification of Cardiorespiratory Abnormalities,IEEE,Journals,"The measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in exhaled air can be used as a diagnostic tool for many pulmonary and respiratory diseases. Capnography, the waveform that tracks the amount of CO2 in exhaled air, reflects the physiological and anatomical conditions of the human body. In this paper, we propose a novel speed of sound-based capnographic sensing mechanism for measuring the CO2 concentration in the exhaled air. The sensor response is further classified using our proposed second-generation convolutional neural network with SVM architecture. Automated quantitative analysis to differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), between healthy and congestive heart failure (CHF), and between COPD and CHF has been implemented. The classification was performed on both the signal acquired using the developed hardware and the signal from the capnobase dataset. Furthermore, the experimental results were clinically validated. The proposed method yields an accuracy of 95.16%, 87.55%, and 90.19% for COPD/Healthy, CHF/Healthy, and COPD/CHF classifications, respectively. The development of a non-invasive, low cost, and small size sensor for capnography can extend the use of capnography from intubated patients to pre-hospital applications. Lower computation time and better accuracy achieved depict the effectiveness of the proposed method to be used in real-time diagnosis of cardiorespiratory diseases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8733864/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Oct.1, 2019",ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095391,Studying the Applicability of Generative Adversarial Networks on HEp-2 Cell Image Augmentation,IEEE,Journals,"The Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANAs) testing is the primary serological diagnosis screening test for autoimmune diseases. ANAs testing is conducted mainly by the Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) on Human Epithelial cell-substrate (HEp-2) protocol. However, due to its high variability, human-subjectivity, and low throughput, there is an insistent need to develop an efficient Computer-Aided Diagnosis system (CADs) to automate this protocol. Many recently proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrated promising results in HEp-2 cell image classification, which is the main task of the HE-p2 IIF protocol. However, the lack of large labeled datasets is still the main challenge in this field. This work provides a detailed study of the applicability of using generative adversarial networks (GANs) algorithms as an augmentation method. Different types of GANs were employed to synthesize HEp-2 cell images to address the data scarcity problem. For systematic comparison, empirical quantitative metrics were implemented to evaluate different GAN models' performance of learning the real data representations. The results of this work showed that though the high visual similarity with the real images, GANs' capacity to generate diverse data is still limited. This deficiency in the generated data diversity is found to be of a crucial impact when used as a standalone method for augmentation. However, combining limited-size GANs-generated data with classic augmentation improves the classification accuracy across different variants of CNNs. Our results demonstrated a competitive performance for the overall classification accuracy and the mean class accuracy of the HEp-2 cell image classification task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9475986/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TBME.2005.869776,Telephony-based voice pathology assessment using automated speech analysis,IEEE,Journals,"A system for remotely detecting vocal fold pathologies using telephone-quality speech is presented. The system uses a linear classifier, processing measurements of pitch perturbation, amplitude perturbation and harmonic-to-noise ratio derived from digitized speech recordings. Voice recordings from the Disordered Voice Database Model 4337 system were used to develop and validate the system. Results show that while a sustained phonation, recorded in a controlled environment, can be classified as normal or pathologic with accuracy of 89.1%, telephone-quality speech can be classified as normal or pathologic with an accuracy of 74.2%, using the same scheme. Amplitude perturbation features prove most robust for telephone-quality speech. The pathologic recordings were then subcategorized into four groups, comprising normal, neuromuscular pathologic, physical pathologic and mixed (neuromuscular with physical) pathologic. A separate classifier was developed for classifying the normal group from each pathologic subcategory. Results show that neuromuscular disorders could be detected remotely with an accuracy of 87%, physical abnormalities with an accuracy of 78% and mixed pathology voice with an accuracy of 61%. This study highlights the real possibility for remote detection and diagnosis of voice pathology.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1597497/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,March 2006,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3177651,Texture Attention Network for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a disease caused by a high level of glucose in retina vessels. This malicious disease put millions of people around the world at risk for vision loss each year. Being a life-threatening disease, early diagnosis can be an effective step in the treatment and prevention of vision loss. To automate the early diagnosis process, computer-aided diagnosis methods are not only useful in detecting the diabetic signatures but also provide information regarding the diabetic grade for the optometrist to determine an appropriate treatment. Several deep classification models are proposed in the literature to solve the diabetic retinopathy classification task, however, these methods usually lack incorporate an attention mechanism to better encode the semantic dependency and highlight the most important region for boosting the model performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to incorporate a style and content recalibration mechanism inside the deep neural network to adaptively scale the informative regions for diabetic retinopathy classification. In our proposed method, the input image passes through the encoder module to encode both high-level and semantic features. Next, by utilizing a content and style separation mechanism, we decompose the representational space into a style (e.g., texture features) and content (e.g., semantic and contextual features) representation. The texture attention module takes the style representation and applies a high-pass filter to highlight the texture information while the spatial normalization module uses a convolutional operation to determine the more informative region inside the retinopathy image to detect diabetic signs. Once the attention modules are applied to the representational features, the fusion module combines both features to form a normalized representation for the decoding path. The decoder module in our model performs both diabetic grading and healthy, non-healthy classification tasks. Our experiment on APTOS Kaggle dataset (accuracy 0.85) demonstrates a significant improvement compared to the literature work. This fact reveals the applicability of our method in a real-world scenario.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9780378/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933437,The OCS-SVM: An Objective-Cost-Sensitive SVM With Sample-Based Misclassification Cost Invariance,IEEE,Journals,"Studies on the traditional support vector machine (SVM) implicitly assume that the costs of different types of mistakes are the same and minimize the error rate. On the one hand, it is not enough for many practical applications to rely solely on the error rate, which reflects only the average classification ability of a classifier. It is also of great significance to consider the performance of classifiers from the perspective of each sample. On the other hand, many real-world problems, such as credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, oil-spill detection and cancer diagnosis, usually involve substantially unequal misclassification costs. To solve this problem, many works on the cost-sensitive SVM (CS-SVM) have emerged. The misclassification costs for this model are generally provided by domain experts. Inspired by the concept of the CS-SVM, we propose a new SVM with sample-based misclassification cost invariance with the aim of constructing a relatively reliable classifier. The relatively reliable classifier is defined as the one with low probabilities of finding a classifier that correctly classifies each misclassified sample. Note that the cost is determined by the inherent characteristics of each sample rather than being subjectively assigned, so we denote the proposed classifier as the objective-cost-sensitive SVM (OCS-SVM). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with nine other commonly used classifiers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8789540/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
