Hence, with the aim of improving the uncertainty management and facilitating the weighting criteria, this paper introduces an improved fuzzy Einstein Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methodology. Such a CoCoSo model improves previous CoCoSo proposals by using nonlinear fuzzy weighted Einstein functions for defining weighted sequences. In addition, it proposes a novel algorithm for determining the criteria weights based on the fuzzy logarithmic function, therefore it allows decision-makers a better perception of the relationship between the criteria, as it considers the relationships between adjacent criteria; high consistency of expert comparisons; and enables the definition of weighting coefficients of a larger set of criteria, without the need to cluster (group) the criteria. Nonlinear fuzzy Einstein functions implemented in the fuzzy Einstein CoCoSo methodology enable the processing of complex and uncertain information. Such characteristics contribute to the rational definition of compromise strategies and enable objective reasoning when solving real-world decision problems. The efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed fuzzy Einstein CoCoSo model are illustrated by a case study to create a conceptual framework to evaluate and rank the prioritization of public transportation management at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal its good performance in determining the transportation management systems strategy.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, accurate bus travel time prediction is important to improve the serviceability of bus transport systems. Many researchers have proposed machine learning and deep learning-based models for bus travel time predictions. However, most of the existing models focus on predicting the travel times using complete data. Moreover, with the dramatically increasing population, bus systems also expand and upgrade their routes to provide improved coverage. Consequently, predicting the routes with sparse or no historical records becomes vital in this situation, and has not been well addressed in the literature. In particular, the challenges involved in this prediction include discovering routes with sparse records, discovering newly deployed routes, and finding the roads that need new routes. In order to address these, we propose a Multi-Attention Graph neural network for city-wide bus travel time estimation (TTE), especially for the routes with limited data, called MAGTTE. In particular, we first represent the bus network using a novel multi-view graph, which can automatically extract the stations and paths as nodes and weighted edges of bus graphs, respectively. Using inductive learning on dynamic graphs, we propose a multi-attention graph neural network with novel masks to capture the global and local spatial dependencies using limited data, and formulate a framework with LSTM and transformer layers to learn short and long-term temporal dependencies. Evaluation of our model on a real-world bus dataset from Xi’an, China demonstrates that the proposed model is superior compared to nine baselines, and robust to highly sparse data.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We propose a novel deep generative adversarial network (GAN) model called CrowdGAN to solve the problem. Specifically, CrowdGAN employs a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract spatio-temporal features from sparse traffic maps, and adopts a novel design of co-training a generator and a discriminator under the supervision of an accuracy assurance network to generate a high-resolution cellular traffic map for prediction. We implement the proposed CrowdGAN in TensorFlow and evaluate its performance using two real-world cellular traffic datasets. Extensive experiments show that CrowdGAN significantly outperforms the baselines on a variety of performance metrics, and achieves at least 47% reduction in root-mean-squared error compared to the state-of-the-art.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the high user mobility among scattered edge servers in many scenarios such as internet of vehicular applications, dynamic service migration is desired to maintain a reliable and efficient quality of service (QoS). However, inevitable service downtime incurred by service migration would largely degrade the real-time performance of delay-sensitive DNN inference services. To address this issue, we advocate a user-centric management for dynamic DNN inference service migration with flexible multi-exit mechanism, aiming at maximizing overall user utility (e.g., DNN model inference accuracy) with various service downtime. We first leverage dynamic programming to propose an optimal offline migration and exit point selection strategy (OMEPS) algorithm when complete future information of user behaviors is available. Amenable to a more practical application domain without complete future information, we incorporate the OMEPS algorithm into a model predictive control (MPC) framework, then construct a mobility-aware service migration and DNN exit point selection (MOMEPS) algorithm, which improves the long-term user utility within limited predictive future information. However, heavy computation overheads of MOMEPS algorithm impose burdens on mobile devices, thus we further advocate a cost-efficient algorithm, named smart-MOMEPS, which introduces a smart migration judgement based on Neural Networks to control the implementation of (MOMEPS) algorithm by wisely estimating whether the DNN service should be migrated or not. Extensive trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our smart-MOMEPS algorithm for achieving significant overall utility improvements with low computation overheads compared with other online algorithms.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

On an operational level, this relates to short-term predictions with lead times of less than an hour. Where conventional data sources on ridership, such as Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data, may have longer lag times and contain no travel intentions, in contrast, trip planner data are often available in (near) real-time and are used before traveling. In this paper, we investigate how such data from a trip planner app can be utilized for short-term bus ridership predictions. This is combined with AFC data (in this case smart card data) to construct a ground truth on actual ridership. Using informative variables from the trip planner dataset through correlation analysis, we develop 3 supervised Machine Learning (ML) models, including k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting. The best-performing model relies on random forest regression with trip planner requests. Compared with the baseline model that depends on the weekly trend, it reduces the mean absolute error by approximately half. Moreover, using the same model with and without trip planner data, we prove the usefulness of trip planner data by an improved mean absolute error of 8.9% and 21.7% and an increased coefficient of determination from a 5-fold cross-validation of 7.8% and 18.5% for two case study lines, respectively. Lastly, we show that this model performance is maintained even for the trip planner requests with prediction lead times up to 30 min ahead, and for different periods of the day. We expect our methodology to be useful for PT operators to elevate their daily operations and level of service as well as for trip planner companies to facilitate passenger replanning, in particular during peak hours.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These alternatives are evaluated on thirteen sub-criteria, grouped under four main aspects: efficiency, operation, social and health, and legislation and regulation.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art accuracy comes at a computational cost rarely available in the edge cloud. At the same time, due to strict latency constraints and the vast amount of bandwidth edge cameras generate, we can no longer rely on offloading the task to a centralized cloud. Consequently, there is a need for a meeting point between the resource-constrained edge cloud and accurate real-time video analytics. If state-of-the-art models are too expensive to run on the edge, and lightweight models are not accurate enough for the use cases in the edge, one solution is to demand less from the lightweight model and specialize it in a narrower scope of the problem, a technique known as model specialization. By specializing a model to the context of a single camera, we can boost its accuracy while keeping its computational cost constant. However, this also involves one training per camera, which quickly becomes unfeasible unless the entire process is fully automated. In this paper, we present and evaluate COVA (Contextually Optimized Video Analytics), a framework to assist in the automatic specialization of models for video analytics in edge cloud cameras. COVA aims to automatically improve the accuracy of lightweight models by specializing them to the context to which they will be deployed. Moreover, we discuss and analyze each step involved in the process to understand the different trade-offs that each one entails. Using COVA, we demonstrate that the whole pipeline can be effectively automated by leveraging large neural networks used as teachers whose predictions are used to train and specialize lightweight neural networks. Results show that COVA can automatically improve pre-trained models by an average of 21% mAP on the different scenes of the VIRAT dataset.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

                  Since February 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly spread throughout Italy. Some studies showed an association of environmental factors, such as PM10, PM2.5, NO2, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and mobility with the spread of the epidemic.
                  In this work, we aimed to predict via Deep Learning the real-time transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy, in a grid with a small resolution (12 km × 12 km), including satellite information.
               
                  Methods
                  We focused on the Province of Reggio Emilia, which was severely hit by the first wave of the epidemic. The outcomes included new SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 hospital admissions. Pollution, meteorological and mobility data were analyzed. The spatial simulation domain included the Province of Reggio Emilia in a grid of 40 cells of (12 km)2. We implemented a ConvLSTM, which is a spatio-temporal deep learning approach, to perform a 7-day moving average to forecast the 7th day after. We used as training and validation set the new daily infections and hospital admissions from August 2020 to March 2021. Finally, we assessed the models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared with Mean Observed Value (MOV) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on data from April to September 2021. We tested the performance of different combinations of input variables to find the best forecast model.
               
                  Findings
                  Daily new cases of infection, mobility and wind speed resulted in being strongly predictive of new COVID-19 hospital admissions (MAE = 2.72 in the Province of Reggio Emilia; MAE = 0.62 in Reggio Emilia city), whereas daily new cases, mobility, solar radiation and PM2.5 turned out to be the best predictors to forecast new infections, with appropriate time lags.
               
                  Interpretation
                  ConvLSTM achieved good performances in forecasting new SARS-CoV-2 infections and new COVID-19 hospital admissions. The spatio-temporal representation allows borrowing strength from data neighboring to forecast at the level of the square cell (12 km)2, getting accurate predictions also at the county level, which is paramount to help optimise the real-time allocation of health care resources during an epidemic emergency.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This study presents a new computer vision–based data acquisition and analytics approach for curb lane monitoring and illegal parking impact assessment. The proposed “rank, detect, and quantify impacts” system consists of three main modules: 1) hotspot identification based on rankings generated by local spatial autocorrelation analysis, 2) curb lane occupancy estimation leveraging traffic cameras and computer vision techniques, and 3) illegal parking traffic impact quantification using an M/M/∞ queueing model. To demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach, it was tested and empirically validated using field data collected from three case study sites in Midtown Manhattan, New York City (NYC)—one of the most complex urban transportation networks in the world. Different types of curb lane occupancy, including parking and bus lanes, and different frequencies of illegal parking (high, moderate, low) were investigated. The proposed method was proven to be effective even for low resolution and discontinuous video feeds obtained from publicly available traffic cameras. All three case study sites achieved good detection accuracy (86% to 96%) for parking and bus lane occupancy, and acceptable precision and recall in detecting illegal parking events. The queueing model was also proven to effectively quantify link travel time with the appearance of illegal parking events of different frequencies. The proposed “rank, detect, and quantify impacts” system is friendly for large-scale real-time implementation and is highly scalable to help evaluate the impact of other modes such as bike or mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. It can also be easily adopted by other cities to provide transportation agencies with effective data collection and innovative curb space management strategies.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, associated optimal deployment is highly challenging due to the involved high-dimensional system planning, non-linear component sizing, and complex solar potential accurate characterization. To address this challenge, this study proposed a strategy to minimize the payback period of the deployed rooftop PV and batteries for achieving net-zero energy of electric bus transportation by taking associated grid impacts into consideration. In this strategy, a genetic algorithm-integer linear programming (GA-ILP) approach was developed to solve the high-dimensional rooftop PV planning problem and the non-linear PV and battery sizing problem. Our 3D-GIS (geographic information system) and DL (deep learning) integrated approach was used to attain accurate spatiotemporal rooftop solar power generation profiles. To verify the proposed strategy, a case study covering 5 bus terminuses with 28 bus routes and a total of 1,224 building rooftops surrounding the terminuses was conducted in a real region of Hong Kong. The effectiveness of the developed strategy was verified by comparing the optimized deployment with 150 million Monte-Carlo-generated solutions. The optimized deployment achieved the shortest payback period of 3.98 years by effectively tackling design issues such as battery oversizing, PV misallocation, and battery misallocation. To meet the increasing requirement on peak export power reduction (representing the grid impact constraint in the study), the proposed strategy can find a cost-effective balance between shifting PVs from higher-density solar potential terminuses to lower ones and increasing battery capacity. The proposed strategy can be adopted in practice to facilitate the development of cost-effective and grid-friendly community-solar-powered electric bus networks in high-density cities.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since the electrification of transport is happening simultaneously, autonomous marine vessels can reduce environmental impact, lower costs, and increase efficiency. Although close monitoring is still required to ensure safety, the ultimate goal is full autonomy. One major milestone is to develop a control system that is versatile enough to handle any weather and encounter that is also robust and reliable. Additionally, the control system must adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) for successful interaction with human sailors. Since the COLREGs were written for the human mind to interpret, they are written in ambiguous prose and therefore not machine-readable or verifiable. Due to these challenges and the wide variety of situations to be tackled, classical model-based approaches prove complicated to implement and computationally heavy. Within machine learning (ML), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential for a wide range of applications. The model-free and self-learning properties of DRL make it a promising candidate for autonomous vessels. In this work, a subset of the COLREGs is incorporated into a DRL-based path following and obstacle avoidance system using collision risk theory.

It is important to examine the effectiveness of such emission reductions and assess the resulting changes in air quality. However, such evaluation is difficult as meteorological factors can amplify, or obscure the changes of air pollutants, in addition to the emission reduction. In this study, we applied the random forest machine learning technique to decouple meteorological influences from emissions changes, and examined the deweathered trends of air pollutants in 12 Chinese mega-cities during 2013–2020. The observed concentrations of all criteria pollutants except O3 showed significant declines from 2013 to 2020, with PM2.5 annual decline rates of 6–9% in most cities. In contrast, O3 concentrations increased with annual growth rates of 1–9%. Compared with the observed results, all the pollutants showed smoothed but similar variation in trend and annual rate-of-change after weather normalization. The response of O3 to NO2 concentrations indicated significant regional differences in photochemical regimes, and the differences between observed and deweathered results provided implications for volatile organic compound emission reductions in O3 pollution mitigation. We further evaluated the effectiveness of first and second clean air actions by removing the meteorological influence. We found that the meteorology can make negative or positive contribution in reducing pollutant concentrations from emission reduction, depending on type of pollutants, locations, and time period. Among the 12 mega-cities, only Beijing showed a positive meteorological contribution in amplifying reductions in main pollutants except O3 during both clean air action periods. Considering the large and variable impact of meteorological effects in changing air quality, we suggest that similar deweathered analysis is needed as a routine policy evaluation tool on a regional basis.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Then the theoretical control policy is extended by using a distributed approximation and position-weighted pressure so that the policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms can be utilized to optimize the parameters in the policy network including the switching curve and the weight curve. Simulation results show that the proposed control method greatly outperforms the conventional max pressure control. The proposed framework combines the strengths of the data-driven method and the theoretical control model by utilizing reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the max pressure controller, which is also of great significance for real-world implementations because the proposed control policy can be generated in a distributed fashion based on local observations.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, their complex characteristics in terms of implementation, data requirements, and simulation time limit their application in regular drinking water source management. This study demonstrates the potential of a ML model (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) as viable alternatives to process-based hydrodynamic and water quality models in water source management. Using meteorological and hydrological measurements, a hydrodynamic and water quality model was first calibrated to predict time series, profiles, and contours of water variables namely Escherichia coli (E. coli), faecal coliforms, zinc, and lead concentrations in the Brusdalsvatnet lake, which is the drinking water source for the city of Ålesund in Norway. The results obtained were combined with the input data to train a suite of LSTM models to emulate the results achieved with the process-based modelling. The results indicate that ML models can conveniently reproduce the spatio-temporal evolution of water quality in the lake that is achievable with the process-based model, particularly when specific locations within the lake are of interest. Compared to R2, NS and MSE ranges of 0.72–0.87, 0.68–0.85, and 0.21–0.44 achieved with the process-based model in the prediction of temperature in the lake, 0.78–0.95, 0.75–0.89, and 0.011–0.028 were respectively achieved in testing the LSTM models. Similar performance levels were achieved with the LSTM model in the prediction of Escherichia coli (E. coli), faecal coliforms, Zinc, and Lead concentrations at different depths in the lake. While setting up and training the LSTM model to emulate the process-based model simulations was very time-consuming, a validated model as developed in this study can offer an opportunity for real-time simulation of water quality in drinking water sources when integrated with cloud data transmission from field sensors.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They improve the predicting accuracy by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract spatial and temporal features from the traffic speed data, respectively. However, these models have complex structures and high computational costs. To improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce the cost of model training, we propose a hybrid model, Spatial-Temporal Gated Graph Attention network (ST-GGAN), based on Graph Attention mechanism (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Such a method has a simpler structure, lower computational costs, and higher predicting accuracy.

Determining them by their respective reference methods, however, is laborious, expensive, and time consuming. To overcome this, we developed a new analytical instrument called Solids in Wastewater's Machine Vision-based Automatic Analyzer (SWAMVA), which is equiped with an automatic sampler and a software for real-time digital movie capture to quantify sequentially the TSS and SetS contents in wastewater samples. The machine vision algorithm (MVA) coupled with the Red color plane (derived from color histograms in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) system) showed the best prediction results with R2 of 0.988 and 0.964, and relative error of prediction (REP) of 6.133 and 9.115% for TSS and SetS, respectively. The constructed models were validated by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the accuracy and precision of the predictions by the t- and F-tests, respectively, at a 0.05 significance level. The elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) test confirmed the accuracy, while the coefficient of variation (CV) of 6.529 and 10.908% confirmed the good precisions, respectively. Compared with the reference method (Standard Methods For the Examination of Water and Wastewater), the proposed method reduced the analysis volume from 1.5 L to just 15 mL and the analysis time from 12 h to 24 s per sample.

Food delivery platforms provide the end-to-end services that connect restaurants with consumers, including the delivery service to those people ordering food through an online portal. A key component of these platforms is logistics, specifically the logistics of drivers. Ideally, the number of drivers operating in an urban area should be just the right number to serve the demand in that area. Since the demand is extremely dynamic in space and time, the spatial–temporal distribution of drivers remains a challenging problem, partially solved by means of variable incentives in different city areas at different times. In this context, a precise demand prediction would avoid a local lack of drivers in some areas, and an inefficient concentration of drivers in some other areas. For this reason, we propose a deep neural network-based methodology to forecast short-term food delivery demand distribution over urban areas. The study, carried out on a real-world dataset from a food delivery company, focuses on hourly demands and frequent prediction updates. The sequential modeling approach, designed to catch rapid changes and sudden variations beyond the general demand trend, is based on a multi-target CNN-LSTM regressor trained on location-specific time series. The methodology uses a single model for all service areas simultaneously, and a single one-step volume inference for every area at each time update. The results disclose a better performance over baselines (historical estimates for the same time-area) and more traditional statistical approaches (moving averages and univariate time-series forecasting), demonstrating a promising implementation potential within an online delivery platform framework.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the periodic impacts of large-scale ecological water transport projects (EWTP) on ecohydrological systems have been neglected. In this study, wavelet analysis was used to evaluate the effect of flow regimes of EWTPs on the dynamics of ecohydrological systems through real data from a megaproject in the Tarim River basin, China. The results reveal that comparing with natural stream, the restoration flow exhibits seasonal periodicities in the winter instead of flood season, and exhibits unstable yearly periodicities. These characteristics created a distinct groundwater dynamics, which are not coincident with the growth rhythm of riparian vegetation. To optimize the EWTP, two designed flow schemes based on the time lags between flow and vegetation growth which was estimated using the wavelet analysis at seasonal and annual scales were proposed to improve the ecosystem restoration efficiency. The NARX network was used to predict the ecological restoration result. The predicting results show an up to 40% increase comparing to original restoration flow with the same total water volume. These results provide a new insight on ecohydrological system dynamics under EWTP from the periodic perspective, and also quantitatively prove that the designed flows based on wavelet analysis can improve ecosystem restoration efficiency in EWTPs.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to effectively handle this problem reliably over the internet. The inclusion of a MEC server allows computationally intensive tasks to be offloaded from IoT devices. However, communication overhead and delays are major drawbacks. With the advantages of high mobility and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can mitigate this issue by acting as MEC servers. The offloading decisions for such scenarios involve service latency, energy/power consumption, and execution delays.

Particularly in the domain of urban transportation, many researchers have put forward novel ideas, which are then implemented and evaluated through prototypes that usually draw upon AI methods and tools.

Here, we address the opportunity to find buildings with high solar heat gain and thus cooling requirements, in order to identify candidate buildings for shading technologies. Prior studies have theoretically documented derived estimates of solar heat gain to buildings, both through heat transport through the envelope and through fenestration. Additionally, various sensors have been added to residences to measure solar heat gain contributions. Such approaches are not replicable at scale. Here, acquired residential smart Wi-Fi thermostat data is combined with solar radiation and weather data. From this data, physics-informed Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and LSTM/GRU combined machine learning models to predict indoor temperature and temporal cooling are trained and validated. Solar heat gain contributions can be assessed by applying the developed model to inputs with solar heating conditions effectively turned off. The difference in cooling requirements, both real time and in total over time, between the actual cooling required and the cooling predicted in the absence of solar heating, reveals the passive solar heat gain for a building. Test residences included in the study offered different energy effectiveness and shading. The passive solar estimations developed uniquely for each residence matched expectations. The results shows that the percentage of cooling required to accommodate solar heat gain for the targeted residences ranged from 48% to 72%, dependent upon both the energy effectiveness and degree of solar shading.

In this regard, we conducted a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of GAN-related RS papers, with the goals of familiarizing the RS community with the potential of GANs and helping researchers further explore RS applications of GANs by untangling challenges common in this field. Our review is based on 231 journal papers that were retrieved and selected through the Web of Science (WoS) database. We reviewed the theories, applications, and challenges of GANs, and highlighted the gaps to explore in future studies. Through the meta-analysis conducted in this study, we observed that image classification (especially urban mapping) has been the most popular application of GANs, potentially due to the wide availability of benchmark datasets. One the other hand, we found that relatively few studies have explored the potential of GANs for analyzing medium spatial-resolution multi-spectral images (e.g., Landsat or Sentinel-2), even though such images are often freely available and useful for a wide range of applications (e.g., urban expansion analysis, vegetation mapping, etc.).

Sleep-related disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), periodic leg movement (PLM), and bruxism lead to hormonal imbalance, slower reaction time, memory problems, depression, and headaches. This adversity of sleep disorder gained the attention of many sleep researchers. To examine the reasons for sleep disorders, it is imperative to monitor and analyze the sleep of the affected patients. The conventional method of monitoring sleep and identifying the sleep disorders using polysomnographic (PSG) recording is a complicated and cumbersome task in which multiple physiological signals with multiple modalities are recorded for a long (overnight) duration. The PSG recordings are carried out in sophisticated sleep laboratories and cannot be considered suitable for real-time sleep monitoring. Thus, a simple and patient-convenient system is highly desirable to monitor and analyze the quality of sleep. We proposed an automatic detection of sleep disorders using single modal electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. We have used a new maximally flat multiplier-less biorthogonal filter bank for obtaining discrete wavelet transform of the signals. We computed Hjorth parameters (HOP) such as activity, mobility, and complexity from the wavelet sub-bands. Highly discriminative HOP features are fed to different machine learning classifiers to develop the model. Our results show that the developed system can classify insomnia, narcolepsy, NFLE, PLM, and REM behaviour disorder (RBD) against normal healthy subjects with an accuracy of 99.7%, 97.6%, 97.5%, 97.5%, and 98.3%, respectively using combined features from EOG and EMG signal. The proposed model has yielded an accuracy of 94.3% in classifying six classes using an ensemble bagged trees classifier (EBTC) with a 10-fold cross-validation technique.

Semantic segmentation provides a rich body of information required for an adequate decision-making process in a clustered, dynamic, and ever-changing manufacturing environment.

Semantic segmentation is carried out by exploiting fully convolutional neural networks. The new visual servoing algorithm utilizes an intensity-based image registration procedure, which results in the image transformation matrix. The transformation matrix encompasses the relations of images taken at the current and desired pose, and that information is directly used for visual servoing. The developed algorithm is deployed on our own developed wheeled differential drive mobile robot RAICO (Robot with Artificial Intelligence based COgnition).

This research aims at introducing a new risk-based multi-objective optimization framework for optimizing performance and budget allocation among subway systems in fulfillment to maintenance planning development in this domain. This would extensively ease the decision-making process for subway asset managers by providing the optimal allocated budget for each subway system in an automated way.

There is less reliance on explicit driver- or vehicle-based messages, such as hand/head movements, or flashing lights/beeping horns. With the impending deployment of Automated Vehicles (AV), especially those at SAE Level 4 and 5, where the driver is no longer in control of the vehicle, there has been a surge in interest in the value of new forms of communication for AVs, for example, via different types of external Human Machine Interfaces (eHMIs). However, there is still much to be understood about how quickly a novel eHMI affects pedestrian crossing decisions, and whether it provides any additional aid, above and beyond implicit/kinematic information from the vehicle. The aim of this between-participant study, funded by the H2020 interACT project, was to investigate how the combination of kinematic information from a vehicle (e.g., Speed and Deceleration), and eHMI designs, play a role in assisting the crossing decision of pedestrians in a cave-based pedestrian simulator. Method: Using an existing, well-recognized, message for yielding (Flashing Headlights - FH) as a benchmark, this study also investigated how quickly a novel eHMI (Slow Pulsing Light Band – SPLB) was learned. To investigate the effect of eHMI visibility on crossing decisions, the distance at which each eHMI was perceivable was also measured. Results: Results showed that, compared to SPLB, the FH led to earlier crossings during vehicle deceleration, especially at lower approaching speeds, and smaller time gaps. However, although FH was visible earlier than SPLB, this visibility does not appear to be the only reason for earlier crossings, with message familiarity thought to play a role. Participants were found to learn the meaning conveyed by FH relatively quickly, crossing around 1 second earlier in its presence (compared to the no eHMI condition), across the three blocks of trials. On the other hand, it took participants at least one block of 12 trials for the new SPLB signal to affect crossing, which only accelerated crossing initiations by around 200 ms, compared to the no eHMI condition. The role of comprehension, long-term exposure, and familiarity of novel messages in this context is therefore important, if AVs are to provide safe, trustworthy communication messages, which will enhance traffic flow and efficiency.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Machine Learning (ML), a powerful methodology for adaptive and predictive system development, has emerged in both vehicular and conventional wireless networks. Adopting data-centric methods enables ML to address highly dynamic vehicular network issues faced by conventional solutions, such as traditional control loop design and optimization techniques. This article provides a short survey of ML applications in vehicular networks from the networking aspect. Research topics covered in this article include network control containing handover management and routing decision making, resource management, and energy efficiency in vehicular networks. The findings of this paper suggest more attention should be paid to network forming/deforming decision making.

Despite a well-constrained global budget, quantification of local and regional methane emissions has proven challenging. Recent advancements in airborne remote sensing instruments such as from the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) provide 2-D observations of CH4 plume column enhancements at an unprecedented resolution of 1–5 m over large geographic areas. Quantifying an emission rate from observed plumes is a critical step for understanding local emission distributions and prioritizing mitigation efforts. However, there exists no method that can predict emission rates from detected plumes in real-time without ancillary data reliably. In order to predict methane point-source emissions directly from high resolution 2-D plume images without relying on other local measurements such as background wind speeds, we trained a convolutional neural network model called MethaNet. The training data was derived from large eddy simulations of methane plumes and realistic measurement noise over agricultural, desert and urban environments. Our model has a mean absolute percentage error for predicting unseen plumes under 17%, a significant improvement from previous methods that require wind information. Using MethaNet, a validation against a natural gas controlled-release experiment agrees to within the precision error estimate. Our results support the basis for the applicability of using deep learning techniques to quantify CH4 point sources in an automated manner over large geographical areas, not only for present and future airborne field campaigns but also for upcoming space-based observations in this decade.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As the interest in AV deployment increases, there is an increasing need to assess and understand the expected implications of AVs on traffic safety. Until recently, most of the literature has been based on either survey questionnaires, simulation analysis, virtual reality, or simulation to assess the safety benefits of AVs. Although few studies have used AV crash data, vulnerable road users (VRUs) have not been a topic of interest. Therefore, this study uses crash narratives from four-year (2017–2020) of AV crash data collected from California to explore the direct and indirect involvement of VRUs. The study applied text network and compared the text classification performance of four classifiers - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NN) and associated performance metrics to attain the objective. It was found that out of 252 crashes, VRUs were, directly and indirectly, involved in 23 and 12 crashes, respectively. Among VRUs, bicyclists and scooterists are more likely to be involved in the AV crashes directly, and bicyclists are likely to be at fault, while pedestrians appear more in the indirectly involvements. Further, crashes that involve VRUs indirectly are likely to occur when the AVs are in autonomous mode and are slightly involved minor damages on the rear bumper than the ones that directly involve VRUs. Additionally, feature importance from the best performing classifiers (RF and NN) revealed that crosswalks, intersections, traffic signals, movements of AVs (turning, slowing down, stopping) are the key predictors of the VRUs-AV related crashes.

With the precise prediction of bus travel times, the cost can be reduced for bus companies, such as from planning fixed buffer times between trips, while a better service can be provided for passengers. In this study, historical bus travel data from a bus line of the HOCHBAHN bus company in Germany in 2019 are used for the analysis. We develop two neural network models, namely multilayer perceptrons and a long short-term memory neural network, for predicting the bus travel time between timepoints for a trip occurring at a given time of day, on a given day of the week, and in given weather conditions. Both neural networks are combined with a genetic algorithm and a Kalman filter to improve accuracy. The genetic algorithm is implemented to tune the neural network parameters, such as the number of hidden layers and neurons in a hidden layer, while the Kalman filter algorithm is used to adjust the travel time prediction for the next trip using the latest bus operation information. In the experiment, we test our models month by month and split data for each month into three parts: the data of the first two weeks for training, one week for validation and the last week for prediction. The experiment results show that the hybrid model is powerful for predicting the bus travel time. In particular, the combination of the multilayer perceptrons with the genetic algorithm and Kalman filter provides the best travel time prediction (with an improvement of 56.2% compared with the planned bus travel time from the bus company). In order to make a recommendation for bus companies to plan vehicles with more accurate bus travel times, we test our hybrid models with larger training sets to predict the travel times e.g. in August. However, due to the structure of the planning problem, the plan for buses should be estimated before a new month begins.

While AV acceptability has been widely studied, changes in human drivers’ behavior and in passengers’ reactions have received less attention. It is not yet possible to ascertain the risk of driver behavioral changes such as overreaction, and the corresponding safety problems, in mixed traffic with partially AVs. Nor has there been proper investigation of the potential unease of car occupants trained for human control, when exposed to automatic maneuvers. The conjecture proposed in this paper is that automation Level 2 vehicles do not induce potentially adverse effects in traditional vehicle drivers’ behavior or in occupants’ reactions, provided that they are indistinguishable from human-driven vehicles. To this end, the paper proposes a Turing approach to test the “humanity” of automation Level 2 vehicles. The proposed test was applied to the results of an experimental campaign carried out in Italy: 546 car passengers were interviewed on board Level 2 cars in which they could not see the driver. They were asked whether a specific driving action (braking, accelerating, lane keeping) had been performed by the human driver or by the automatic on-board software under different traffic conditions (congestion and speed). Estimation results show that in most cases the interviewees were unable to distinguish the Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the human driver by observing random responses with a 95% significance level (proportion of success statistically equal to 50%). However, in the case of moderate braking and lane keeping at >100 km/h and in high traffic congestion, respondents recognized AI control from the human driver above pure chance, with 62–69% correct response rates. These findings, if confirmed in other case studies, could significantly impact on AVs acceptability, also contributing to their design as well as to long-debated ethical questions. AI driving software could be designed and tested for “humanity”, as long as safety is guaranteed, and autonomous cars could be allowed to circulate as long as they cannot be distinguished from human-driven vehicles in recurrent driving conditions.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Previous works mainly focus on binary change detection (BCD) based on modern technologies, e.g., deep fully convolutional network (FCN), whereas the deep network architecture for semantic change detection (SCD) is insufficiently explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task encoder-transformer-decoder architecture (ChangeMask) designed by exploring two important inductive biases: sematic-change causal relationship and temporal symmetry. ChangeMask decouples the SCD into a temporal-wise semantic segmentation and a BCD, and then integrates these two tasks into a general encoder-transformer-decoder framework. In the encoder part, we design a semantic-aware encoder to model the semantic-change causal relationship. This encoder is only used to learn semantic representation and then learn change representation from semantic representation via a later transformer module. In this way, change representation can constrain semantic representation during training, which introduces a regularization to reduce the risk of overfitting. To learn a robust change representation from semantic representation, we propose a temporal-symmetric transformer (TST) to guarantee temporal symmetry for change representation and keep it discriminative. Based on the above semantic representation and change representation, we adopt simple multi-task decoders to output semantic change map. Benefiting from the differentiable building blocks, ChangeMask can be trained by a multi-task loss function, which significantly simplifies the whole pipeline of applying ChangeMask. The comprehensive experimental results on two large-scale SCD datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ChangeMask in SCD. Besides, to demonstrate the potential value in real-world applications, e.g., automatic urban analysis and decision-making, we deploy the ChangeMask to map a large geographic area covering 30 km2 with 300 million pixels.

Moreover, the advanced deep reinforcement learning method Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) is used to obtain a promising EMS. To improve the adaptability of the strategy, a stochastic training environment, which is based on real measured speed profiles considering passenger numbers is used for training. Assuming different environmental and passenger transport volumes, the results confirm that the proposed TD3-EMS achieves battery charge-sustaining at low hydrogen consumption while slowing down fuel cell degradation.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In CR, the PU detection methods are mostly based on statistical models, and their detection performance heavily relies on the accuracy of assumed models. In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns. Correspondingly, the proposed PU-Net can be adopted for IoT/UAV-assisted communication systems in optimizing spectrum efficiency and resolving the coexistence issues in 5G and beyond networks.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Energy management, which optimizes the onboard energy usage, is a critical functionality of electric vehicles. It is usually developed following the model-based routine, which is conventionally costly and time-consuming and is hard to meet the increasing market competition in the digital era. To reduce the development workload for the energy management controller, this paper studies an innovative transfer learning routine. A new transferable representation control model is proposed by incorporating two promising artificial intelligence technologies, adaptive neural fuzzy inference system and Gaussian process regression, where the former applies k-fold cross valudation to build a neural fuzzy system for real-time implementation of offline optimization result, and the later connects the neural fuzzy system with a ‘deeper’ architecture to transfer the offline optimization knowledge learnt at source domain to new target domains. By introducing a concept of control utility that evaluates vehicle energy efficiency with a penalty on usage of battery energy, experimental evaluations based on the hardware-in-the-loop testing platform are conducted.

Limitations in obtaining measurements of turning movements have drawn attention to the need for alternative methods for estimation of turning rates. In a large-scale urban network, characteristics such as disparate signal plans and various intersection layouts make defining a generic model for the entire network challenging. For this reason, most of the proposed methods are impractical for real-field implementation. The application of existing optimization-based methods is also limited by computational complexity, the need for pre-defined assumptions and insufficient stationary traffic measurements (e.g. loop detectors and plate recognition cameras) in urban networks. In this study, we take advantage of probe vehicles to propose a hybrid method that noticeably reduces the need for stationary measurements in the network. This hybrid method consists of two core stages: signal processing, and physical data-driven modeling to consecutively estimate turning rates. In the signal processing phase, we use wavelet transformation to extract fundamental components of inferred floating car turning rates. These components are then used as inputs to a turning rate estimation model. Using these decomposed components of floating car turning rates instead of raw input helps to balance the effect of low and high-frequency signal components and leads to a more accurate estimation.

Off-grid water filtration plants are an alternative for communities where transportation of freshwater becomes a real challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for the water potabilization processes. For such potable water filtration plants, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be a viable solution to meet their energy demand meanwhile providing a sustainable water solution.
                  The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization.
                  Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function.

Smart walkers are a commonly used solution that should embed automatic and objective tools for data-driven human-in-the-loop control and monitoring. However, present solutions focus on extracting few specific metrics from dedicated sensors with no unified full-body approach. We investigate a general, real-time, full-body pose estimation framework based on two RGB+D camera streams with non-overlapping views mounted on a smart walker equipment used in rehabilitation. Human keypoint estimation is performed using a two-stage neural network framework. The 2D-Stage implements a detection module that locates body keypoints in the 2D image frames. The 3D-Stage implements a regression module that lifts and relates the detected keypoints in both cameras to the 3D space relative to the walker. Model predictions are low-pass filtered to improve temporal consistency. A custom acquisition method was used to obtain a dataset, with 14 healthy subjects, used for training and evaluating the proposed framework offline, which was then deployed on the real walker equipment. An overall keypoint detection error of 3.73 pixels for the 2D-Stage and 44.05 mm for the 3D-Stage were reported, with an inference time of 26.6 ms when deployed on the constrained hardware of the walker.

The UAV carrying a suspended load has two different dynamic behaviors, depending on the state of the cable. Thus, we proposed to model the complete system using the hybrid automata formalism. Using this novel UAV model approach, a hybrid control is designed based on feedback linearization controllers combined with an artificial neural network, which acts as an online estimator of the unknown mass. The suspended load is dealt with as an external disturbance. Simulation results show how the on-line learning control scheme increases the robustness of the control and it is able to stabilize the quadrotor without any information about neither the position of the load nor the tension of the cable.

This paper proposes a real-time learning and control framework for signalized intersection management, which includes both signal optimization and CAV trajectory control. The proposed framework integrates perception, prediction, planning, and optimization components and aims at improving efficiency mixed connected automated traffic in terms of traffic throughput and delay. This framework applies the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to implicitly learn traffic patterns and driver behavior and then estimate and predict the microscopic traffic conditions that are only partially observable. Then it utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve signal optimization problems by learning from the dynamic interactions between vehicles and the traffic environment. Under the proposed framework, the vehicular trajectories of CAVs can be controlled to maximize the utilization of the green time and reduce the start-up lost time by using a highly efficient trajectory planning algorithm. The CAV platooning operation, in coordination with traffic signals, is also implemented such that CAVs can pass the intersection efficiently. Simulations are performed at a signalized intersection a signalized intersection with multi-lane approaches, high traffic demand, and standard ring-barrier control, and results show that the proposed DRL-TP3 framework can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the average delay across different CAV market penetration rates (MPRs).

                  This was a prospective observational cohort study of chest pain patients transported by emergency medical services to three tertiary care hospitals in the US. We obtained raw 10-s, 12‑lead ECGs (500 s/s, HeartStart MRx, Philips Healthcare) during prehospital transport and followed patients 30 days after the encounter to adjudicate clinical outcomes. A total of 557 global and lead-specific features of P-QRS-T waveform were harvested from the representative average beats. We used Recursive Feature Elimination and LASSO to identify 35/557, 29/557, and 51/557 most recurrent and important features for LAD, LCX, and RCA culprits, respectively. Using the union of these features, we built a random forest classifier with 10-fold cross-validation to predict the presence or absence of culprit lesions.

The performance of secondary user communication depends largely on the intelligent choice of an appropriate spectral opportunity. The purpose of this research is to propose and assess the performance of a spectral decision model for CRN based on the Deep Learning technique. To achieve this, a classifier was adapted through the feature extraction technique that identifies three levels of traffic (high, medium and low) in a spectral occupation experimental power matrix that models the primary user. The extraction of features is done by Deep Learning and the process of classifying the successful set of features is done by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). These were used along with five evaluation metrics—total handoffs, failed handoffs, bandwidth, delay and throughput—to measure the performance of the proposed spectral decision model based on the Deep Learning technique, and to compare the results with the Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution (VIKOR), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW). This work presents five contributions: incorporation of the real behavior of licensed users, implementation of performance metrics for spectral mobility, proposal of an RGB conversion algorithm based on the threshold level, feedback in the classifier and a methodology based on priorities and scores to establish the channels with the highest availability.

These systems rely entirely on online traffic flow info estimated from time-dependent vehicle trajectories. Vehicle trajectories are extracted from vehicle detection and tracking data obtained by processing road-side camera images. General-purpose object detectors including Yolo, SSD, EfficientNet have been utilized extensively for real-time object detection task, but, in principle, Yolo is preferred because it provides a high frame per second (FPS) performance and robust object localization functionality. However, this algorithm’s average vehicle classification accuracy is below 57%, which is insufficient for traffic flow monitoring. This study proposes improving the vehicle classification accuracy of Yolo, and developing a novel bounding box (Bbox)-based vehicle tracking algorithm. For this purpose, a new vehicle dataset is prepared by annotating 7216 images with 123831 object patterns collected from highway videos. Nine machine learning-based classifiers and a CNN-based classifier were selected. Next, the classifiers were trained via the dataset. One out of ten classifiers with the highest accuracy was selected to combine to Yolo. This way, the classification accuracy of the Yolo-based vehicle detector was increased from 57% to 95.45%. Vehicle detector 1 (Yolo) and vehicle detector 2 (Yolo + best classifier), and the Kalman filter-based tracking as vehicle tracker 1 and the Bbox-based tracking as vehicle tracker 2 were applied to the categorical/total vehicle counting tasks on 4 highway videos.

With big data and artificial intelligence technologies, it is possible to estimate personalized air pollution exposure and synchronize it with activity, health, quality of life and behavioural data, and provide real-time, personalized and interactive alert and advice to improve the health and well-being of individual citizens. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM2.5 and PM1.0 and NO2) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM1.0 and PM2.5, NO2 exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change.

Coping with emerging infectious diseases such as Covid-19, different mitigation policies are developed by countries. However, the benefit of each mitigation policy is still not well-explored due to the considerable difference between implementations of policies in each country. The question is which policies play a significant role in controlling Covid-19 transmission. Developing two models used in Artificial Neural Network, this study investigates the impact of mitigation policies or strategies (a combination of policies) by considering different vaccination and mutation scenarios. The former model requires the prediction of reproduction number based on the number of cases reported in previous days; whereas, the latter model is constructed based on the number of people impacted by a mitigation policy or strategy. Although the first model yields more accurate results, it requires the use of historical data; hence, the passage of time during a critical period of fighting against Covid-19. The benefit of the second model is that it can be implemented more quickly by determining a coefficient for each policy or strategy based on the restricted population and/or limited mobility. Testing different scenarios through a real-world example from Turkey, we find mitigation policies or strategies play a significant role in controlling Covid-19; as well as vaccination and mutation scenarios. Our results suggest continuous and predetermined mitigation policies or strategies should be implemented to control the spread of infectious diseases in addition to a successful vaccination program.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents a multi-stage machine learning framework to predict passengers’ boarding stops using smart card data. The framework addresses the challenges arising from the imbalanced nature of the data (e.g. many non-travelling data) and the ‘many-class’ issues (e.g. many possible boarding stops) by decomposing the prediction of hourly ridership into three stages: whether to travel or not in that one-hour time slot, which bus line to use, and at which stop to board. A simple neural network architecture, fully connected networks (FCN), and two deep learning architectures, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) are implemented. The proposed approach is applied to a real-life bus network. We show that the data imbalance has a profound impact on the accuracy of prediction at individual level. At aggregated level, FCN is able to accurately predict the rideship at individual stops, it is poor at capturing the temporal distribution of ridership.

Many intelligent air quality monitoring networks have been deployed in various places, especially in big cities. These monitoring networks collect air quality data with some missing data for some reasons which pose an obstacle for air quality publishing and studies. Generative adversarial nets (GAN) methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in missing data imputation. GAN-based imputation method needs enough training data while one monitoring network has just a few and poor quality monitoring data and these data sets do not meet the independent identical distribution (IID) condition. Therefore, one monitoring network side needs to utilize more monitoring data from other sides as far as possible. However, in the real world, these air quality monitoring networks are owned by different organizations — companies, the government even some secret units. Many of them cannot share detailed monitoring data due to security, privacy, and industrial competition. In this paper, it is the first time to propose a conditional GAN imputation method under a federated learning framework to solve the data sets that come from diverse data-owners without sharing. Furthermore, we improve the vanilla conditional GAN performance with Wasserstein distance and “Hint mask” trick. The experimental results show that our GAN-based imputation methods can achieve the best performance. And our federated GAN imputation method outperforms the GAN imputation method trained locally for each participant which means our imputation model can work. Our proposed federated GAN method can benefit model quality by increasing access to air quality data through private multi-institutional collaborations. We further investigate the effects of data geographical distribution across collaborating participants on model quality and, interestingly, we find that the GAN training process with a federated learning framework performs more stable.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Floating solids are often not transported by the pump suction inlets and the individual solids can accumulate to stiff and thick FOG layers. The lack of data about the dynamics in FOG layer formation still hampers the design of effective measures towards its mitigation. In this article, we present a low-cost camera-based automated system for the observation of FOG layer dynamics in wastewater pumping stations at high-frequency (minutes) over extended time windows (months). Optical imagery is processed through a deep-learning computer vision routine that allows describing FOG layer dynamics (e.g. accumulation rate and changes in shape) and various hydraulic processes in the pump sump (e.g. the water level, surface flow velocity fields, vorticity, or circulation). Furthermore, the system can perform in-camera image processing, thus allowing the transfer of compressed-processed datasets when deployed in remote locations (Edge AI computing), which could be of great utility for the hydro-ecological monitoring community. In this study, the technology applied is illustrated with a dataset (six months, two-minute frequency) collected at a wastewater pumping station at the municipality of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. This monitoring system represents a source of information for the management of (waste)water pumping stations (e.g. detection of free-surface vortices and scheduling of sump cleaning operations) and facilitates the collection of standardized high-frequency FOG layer dynamics data for a detailed description of FOG build-up and transport processes.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The difficulty lies in simultaneously obtaining the optimal multivariable solution for spatial pricing and sequential solution for dynamic pricing, considering the heterogeneity, dynamics, and imbalance of on-demand ride supply/demand. Due to this problem's complexity, most studies have simplified the modeling setting and omitted the complicated matching and waiting process between drivers and passengers.

The reinforcement learning approach proximal policy optimization (PPO) is implemented in the RL-ABMS system, where two feed-forward neural networks are built as critic and actor. The critic judges the goodness of the current state, and the actor generates the optimal pricing strategy.Compared with the fixed pricing strategy, the experimental results on a real-world urban network show that dynamic pricing raises the platform's profit to 1.25 times, and spatial–temporal pricing even raises it to 1.85 times.

Accurate prediction of passenger demands is an essential step towards rescheduling resources to resolve the above challenges. However, existing work cannot fully capture and leverage the complex nonlinear spatial–temporal relationships within multi-modal data. They either include excessive data from weakly-correlated regions or oversight the correlations among those similar yet geographically distant regions. Moreover, these methods mainly focus on predicting the passenger demand for one future time step, whereas predictions over longer time scales are more valuable for developing efficient vehicle deployment strategies. We propose an end-to-end deep learning based framework to solve the above challenges. Our model comprises three parts: (1) a cascade graph convolutional recurrent neural network to extract spatial–temporal correlations within citywide historical vehicle demand data; (2) two multi-layer LSTM networks to represent the external meteorological data and time meta separately; (3) an encoder–decoder module to fuse the above two parts and decode the representation to achieve prediction over a longer time period into the future.

                  The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed health systems worldwide and highlighted limitations of diagnostic testing. Several types of diagnostic tests including RT-PCR-based assays and antigen detection by lateral flow assays, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, have been developed and deployed in a short time.
               
                  Methods
                  Here, we describe an immunoaffinity purification approach followed a by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted qualitative assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen from nasopharyngeal swab samples. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was developed using fragment ion intensities from the PRM data.
               
                  Findings
                  The optimized targeted assay, which was used to analyze 88 positive and 88 negative nasopharyngeal swab samples for validation, resulted in 98% (95% CI = 0.922–0.997) (86/88) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI = 0.958–1.000) (88/88) specificity using RT-PCR-based molecular testing as the reference method.

In addition to the high cost of mitigation and damage to property, floods make roads impassable and hamper community evacuation, movement of goods and services, and rescue missions. Knowing the depth of floodwater is critical to the success of response and recovery operations that follow. However, flood mapping especially in urban areas using traditional methods such as remote sensing and digital elevation models (DEMs) yields large errors due to reshaped surface topography and microtopographic variations combined with vegetation bias. This paper presents a deep neural network approach to detect submerged stop signs in photos taken from flooded roads and intersections, coupled with Canny edge detection and probabilistic Hough transform to calculate pole length and estimate floodwater depth. Additionally, a tilt correction technique is implemented to address the problem of sideways tilt in visual analysis of submerged stop signs. An in-house dataset, named BluPix 2020.1 consisting of paired web-mined photos of submerged stop signs across 10 FEMA regions (for U.S. locations) and Canada is used to evaluate the models. Overall, pole length is estimated with an RMSE of 17.43 and 8.61 in. in pre- and post-flood photos, respectively, leading to a mean absolute error of 12.63 in. in floodwater depth estimation.

Energy consumption is one of the major issues in global and national policies, therefore scientific efforts in creating prediction models of energy consumption and cost are highly important. One of the largest energy consumers in every state is its public sector, consisting of educational, health, public administration, military, and other types of public buildings. Recent technologies based on sensor networks and Big data platforms enable collection of large amounts of data that could be used to analyze energy consumption and cost. A real data from Croatian public sector is used in this paper including a large number of constructional, energetic, occupational, climate and other attributes. The algorithms for data pre-processing and modeling by optimizing parameters are suggested. Three strategies were tested: (1) with all available variables, (2) with a filter-based variable selection, and (3) with a wrapper-based variable selection which integrates Boruta algorithm and random forest. Prediction models of energy cost are created using two approaches: (a) comparative usage of artificial neural networks and two types of regression trees, CART and random forest, and (b) integration of RF-Boruta variable selection and machine learning methods for prediction. A cross-validation procedure was used to optimize the artificial neural network and regression tree topology, as well to select the most appropriate activation function. Along with creating a prediction model, the aim of the paper was also to extract the relevant predictors of energy cost in public buildings which are important in planning the construction or renovation of buildings. The results have shown that the second approach which integrates machine learning with Boruta method, where the random forest algorithm is used for both variable reduction and prediction modeling, has produced a higher accuracy of prediction than the individual usage of three machine learning methods. Such findings confirm the potential of hybrid machine learning methods which are suggested in previous research, but in favor of random forest method over CART and artificial neural networks. Regarding the variable selection, the model has extracted heating and occupational data as the most important, followed by constructional, cooling, electricity, and lighting attributes. The model could be implemented in public buildings information systems and their IoT networks within the concept of smart buildings and smart cities.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These results compare favourably to the ground truth data with vehicle counting accuracies of 5% realised. Detection of sparse motorcycles and pedestrians were less than optimal.

For success, the chosen strategy would need considerable public support. So here we demonstrate how support, or otherwise, could have been predicted using our freely available Planticipate app. It self improves by sending its users' judgements to the cloud, where learning routines formulate regression- and neural network-based relationships between thirteen, key, plan-evaluation criteria and overall plan desirability. Hence whenever any set of plans are scored on the criteria, these relationships generate forecasts of plan desirability according to a number of demographic groups of past users. Our app predicted that many community groups will regard the ‘do-Nothing’ option as statistically significantly inferior to the other two plans, and it also made several less-than-statistically-significant forecasts which were extremely thought provoking. Using innovative face charts to better interpret complicated, thirteen-dimensional data, Planticipate also suggested probable reasons for such forecasts. These included an apparent fixation upon only permissiveness and productivity by people living in North America and relative pragmatism amongst females. Such revelations immediately suggested possible modifications for making different plans more acceptable to certain community groups. Given that in reality several of these modifications were only implemented later on during the pandemic, an early application of our app would almost certainly have prompted faster, more creative and more empathetic urban management.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Each node underwent a calibration process by co-locating the node at an EU reference air quality monitoring station, followed by a deployment in a sub-urban or rural area in Catalonia, Spain. All nodes spent two to three weeks co-located at a reference station in Barcelona, Spain (urban area), followed by two to three weeks co-located at three sub-urban reference stations near the final deployment site. The nodes were then deployed in volunteers' homes for about two months and, finally, the nodes were co-located again at the sub-urban reference stations for two weeks for final calibration and assessment of potential drifts. All data presented in this paper are raw data taken by the sensors that can be used for scientific purposes such as calibration studies using machine learning algorithms, or once the concentration values of the nodes are obtained, they can be used to create tropospheric ozone pollution maps with heterogeneous data sources (reference stations and low-cost sensors).",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

If some flows are classified as suspicious, then middleboxes provide evidence of the evaluation results and request the corresponding session-keys from the agents. The agents verify the evidence, and if it is convincing, respond with the correct session-keys. With the session-keys, middleboxes finally decrypt the suspected encrypted flows and perform conventional DPI using intrusion signatures.

The VEGF-C expression level was determined using RT-qPCR and western blotting, and the VEGF-C concentration in supernatant was measured by ELISA. Tumor xenograft models of HCT-116 cells were generated using BALB/c nude mice, and the mice were randomly divided into a control group (gavaged with normal saline) and QFG group (gavaged with 2 g/kg QFG). The effect of QFG on tumor growth was evaluated by comparing the volume and weight of tumors between two groups. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-qPCR were performed to detect the expression levels of VEGF-C, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), and LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1). ELISA was performed to measure the concentration of serum VEGF-C. TMT proteomics technology and Reactome pathway analysis were used to explore the mechanism of QFG inhibiting lymphangiogenesis in tumor. The VEGF-C (5 ng/mL)-stimulated human lymphatic endothelial cell (HLEC) model was conducted to evaluate the effect of QFG on lymphangiogenesis in vitro. The model cells were treated with different concentrations (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/mL) of QFG. Cell viability was then determined using an MTT assay. The cell migration, invasion, and tube-formation ability were analyzed using transwell migration, matrigel invasion and tube formation assays, respectively. The underlying mechanism was uncovered, the levels of VEGFR-3, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/ mTOR were detected using western blotting.
               
                  Results
                  QFG significantly reduced VEGF-C expression and secretion in HCT-116 cells. QFG evidently suppressed in vivo tumor growth and the expression of VEGF-C, VEGFR-3, and LYVE-1. The serum VEGF-C level was also reduced by QFG. Moreover, TMT proteomics technology and Reactome pathway analysis identified 95 differentially expressed protein and multiple enriched pathway about matrix metalloproteinase and extracellular matrix, which is direct associate with lymphangiogenesis. In vitro experiment, QFG inhibited the viability, migration, invasion and tube formation of HLECs. Additionally, QFG reduced the VEGFR-3, MMP-2, MMP-9 expression levels, and the p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/ mTOR ratios.
               
                  Conclusion
                  QFG can exert its effect on both tumor cells and HLECs, exhibiting ani- lymphangiogenesis in colorectal cancer via the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 dependent PI3K/AKT pathway pathway.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The concept of “smart cities” aims at utilising advanced technologies, artificial intelligence and high computational capacity to increase their resilience and improve the services provided to the citizens. Computation-based numerical simulations have been essentially used to estimate the effects of explosion events in urban environments in terms of both structural damage and human casualties. These provide urban planners and decision makers with valuable information for vulnerability assessment and aid developing prevention or mitigation solutions. In this article, we present a framework to generate a 3D large-scale urbanistic finite element model, where the desired geospatial data are extracted from the open-source world map OpenStreetMap. The model is used to simulate blast wave propagation effects in a wide urban area taking into account the reflections at building surfaces via a sophisticated Fluid-Structure interaction technique integrated in the EUROPLEXUS explicit finite element method software. The explosion in the Port of Beirut in Lebanon, which took place on the 4th of August 2020, was remarkable for the large amount of explosive material causing considerable damage to surrounding structures and a high number of deaths and injured.

These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from

More specifically, leveraging the Gaussian process (GP) as the base model, a stochastic physics regularized Gaussian process (PRGP) model is developed and a Bayesian inference algorithm is used to estimate the mean and kernel of the PRGP. A physics regularizer, based on macroscopic traffic flow models, is also developed to augment the estimation via a shadow GP and an enhanced latent force model is used to encode physical knowledge into the stochastic process. Based on the posterior regularization inference framework, an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm is then developed to maximize the evidence lowerbound of the system likelihood. For model evaluations, this paper conducts empirical studies on a real-world dataset which is collected from a stretch of I-15 freeway, Utah.

                  Finger mobility plays a crucial role in everyday living and is a leading indicator during hand rehabilitation and assistance tasks. Depth-based hand pose estimation is a potentially low-cost solution for the clinical and home-based measurement of symptoms of limited human finger motion.
               
                  Objective
                  The purpose of this study was to achieve the contactless measurement of finger motion based on depth-based hand pose estimation using Azure Kinect depth cameras and transfer learning, and to evaluate the accuracy in comparison with a three-dimensional motion analysis (3DMA) system.
               
                  Methods
                  Thirty participants performed a series of tasks during which their hand motions were measured concurrently using the Azure Kinect and 3DMA systems. We propose a simple and effective approach to achieving real-time hand pose estimations from single depth images using ensemble convolutional neural networks trained by a transfer learning strategy. Algorithms to calculate the finger joint motion angles are presented by tracking the locations of the 24 hand joints. To demonstrate their potential, the Azure-Kinect-based 3D finger motion measurement system and algorithms are experimentally verified through comparison with a camera-based 3DMA system, which is the gold standard.

We present a detailed description of the computational models implemented in the open source GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo x-ray imaging simulation code MC-GPU. This code, originally developed to simulate radiography and computed tomography, has been extended to replicate a commercial full-field digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) device. The code was recently used to image 3000 virtual breast models with the aim of reproducing in silico a clinical trial used in support of the regulatory approval of DBT as a replacement of mammography for breast cancer screening. The updated code implements a more realistic x-ray source model (extended 3D focal spot, tomosynthesis acquisition trajectory, tube motion blurring) and an improved detector model (direct-conversion Selenium detector with depth-of-interaction effects, fluorescence tracking, electronic noise and anti-scatter grid). The software uses a high resolution voxelized geometry model to represent the breast anatomy. To reduce the GPU memory requirements, the code stores the voxels in memory within a binary tree structure. The binary tree is an efficient compression mechanism because many voxels with the same composition are combined in common tree branches while preserving random access to the phantom composition at any location. A delta scattering ray-tracing algorithm which does not require computing ray-voxel interfaces is used to minimize memory access. Multiple software verification and validation steps intended to establish the credibility of the implemented computational models are reported. The software verification was done using a digital quality control phantom and an ideal pinhole camera. The validation was performed reproducing standard bench testing experiments used in clinical practice and comparing with experimental measurements. A sensitivity study intended to assess the robustness of the simulated results to variations in some of the input parameters was performed using an in silico clinical trial pipeline with simulated lesions and mathematical observers. We show that MC-GPU is able to simulate x-ray projections that incorporate many of the sources of variability found in clinical images, and that the simulated results are robust to some uncertainty in the input parameters. Limitations of the implemented computational models are discussed.

These restrictions had positive impacts for air quality due to a dramatic reduction of economic activity and atmospheric emissions. In this work, a machine learning approach was designed and implemented to analyze local air quality improvements during the COVID-19 lockdown in Graz, Austria. The machine learning approach was used as a robust alternative to simple, historical measurement comparisons for various individual pollutants. Concentrations of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), PM10 (particulate matter), O3 (ozone) and Ox (total oxidant) were selected from five measurement sites in Graz and were set as target variables for random forest regression models to predict their expected values during the city’s lockdown period. The true vs. expected difference is presented here as an indicator of true pollution during the lockdown. The machine learning models showed a high level of generalization for predicting the concentrations. Therefore, the approach was suitable for analyzing reductions in pollution concentrations. The analysis indicated that the city’s average concentration reductions for the lockdown period were: -36.9 to −41.6%, and −6.6 to −14.2% for NO2 and PM10, respectively. However, an increase of 11.6–33.8% for O3 was estimated. The reduction in pollutant concentration, especially NO2 can be explained by significant drops in traffic-flows during the lockdown period (−51.6 to −43.9%).

We present an in-depth analysis of the spatio-temporal demand and supply, level of service, and origin and destination patterns of Belleville ODT users, based on the data collected from September 2018 till May 2019. The independent and combined effects of the demographic characteristics (population density, working-age, and median income) on the ODT trip production and attraction levels were studied using GIS and the K-means machine learning clustering algorithm. The results indicate that ODT trips demand is highest for 11:00 pm–11:45 pm during the weekdays and 8:00 pm–8:30 pm during the weekends. We expect this to be the result of users returning home from work or shopping. Results showed that 39% of the trips were found to have a waiting time of smaller than 15 min, while 28% of trips had a waiting time of 15–30 min. The dissemination areas with higher population density, lower median income, or higher working-age percentages tend to have higher ODT trip attraction levels, except for the dissemination areas that have highly attractive places like commercial areas. For the sustainable deployment of ODT services, we recommend (a) proactively relocating the empty ODT vehicles near the neighbourhoods with high level of activity, (b) dynamically updating the fleet size and location based on the anticipated changes in the spatio-temporal demand, and (c) using medium occupancy vehicles, like vans or minibuses to ensure high level of service.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data.

Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers.

The results show that considering all the influencing variables can significantly enhance the prediction performance, but comparatively speaking, the route characteristics contribute the most among the three categories and involving more variables demonstrates greater advantages within the trip length under 20 km. It is also found that the trip length, the number of bus stops and the number of the traffic lights passed rank the top three most influencing factors, while the wet-dry condition is the least one. In addition, the variations under five operation scenarios show similar trend. The trip length and average travel speed are inversely proportional to the specific electricity consumption, while the number of bus stops visited, traffic lights passed, and ambient temperature exhibit a gentle proportional relationship.

Data-driven approaches have become very popular for fault detection with the implemented built-in monitoring systems and the artificial intelligence.

The main purpose of LR is to transform irregularly developed land parcels into suitable forms. Since it is necessary to handle many criteria simultaneously to solve LR problems, classical mathematical methods can be insufficient due to time limitation. Since LR problems are similar to traveling salesman problems and typical scheduling problems in terms of structure, they are kinds of NP-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. Therefore, metaheuristic algorithms are used in order to solve NP-hard problems instead of classical methods. At first, in this study, an effective problem-specific objective function is proposed to address the main criteria of the problem. In addition, a map-based crossover operator and three different mutation operators are proposed for the LR, and then a hybrid approach is implemented by utilizing those operators together. Furthermore, since the optimal value of the problem handled in real world cannot be exactly estimated, a synthetic dataset is proposed as a benchmarking set in LR which makes the success of algorithms can be objectively evaluated. This dataset consists of 5 different problems according to number of parcel which are 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100. Each problem set consists of 4 sub-problems in terms of number of landowners per-parcel which are 1, 2, 3 and 4. Therefore, the dataset consists of 20 kinds of problems.

Here, we review the recent development of trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) coupled to TOF mass analysis. In particular, the parallel accumulation–serial fragmentation (PASEF) operation mode offers unique advantages in terms of sequencing speed and sensitivity. Its defining feature is that it synchronizes the release of ions from the TIMS device with the downstream selection of precursors for fragmentation in a TIMS quadrupole TOF configuration. As ions are compressed into narrow ion mobility peaks, the number of peptide fragment ion spectra obtained in data-dependent or targeted analyses can be increased by an order of magnitude without compromising sensitivity. Taking advantage of the correlation between ion mobility and mass, the PASEF principle also multiplies the efficiency of data-independent acquisition. This makes the technology well suited for rapid proteome profiling, an increasingly important attribute in clinical proteomics, as well as for ultrasensitive measurements down to single cells. The speed and accuracy of TIMS and PASEF also enable precise measurements of collisional cross section values at the scale of more than a million data points and the development of neural networks capable of predicting them based only on peptide sequences. Peptide collisional cross section values can differ for isobaric sequences or positional isomers of post-translational modifications. This additional information may be leveraged in real time to direct data acquisition or in postprocessing to increase confidence in peptide identifications.

The involved operators are, however, often reluctant to cooperate as they fear loosing valuable information and autonomy, eventually leading their clients to choose another (cooperating) operator. In this paper we propose a real-time co-planning method, called Secure Departure Learning that in real-time lets several truck operators indicate to a barge operator what departure schedules they prefer without revealing any sensitive information. The method uses Paillier encryption and a learning method inspired by Bayesian Optimization in a model predictive control framework. At frequent time intervals a number of potential barge schedules are communicated to the co-planning truck operators. They evaluate their operation cost for each schedule and communicate it to the barge operator encrypted using several public keys. The barge operator computes the encrypted total cost for each schedules, which hereafter is decrypted by several truck operators. The first action of the schedule that results in the lowest total cost is implemented in a model predictive control fashion. Simulated experiments on a realistic, Dutch transport network illustrate that Secure Departure Learning is a good alternative for replacing the current method in practice, where barge departures are scheduled ahead of time and only mode-decisions can be updated in real time.

The ravages of COVID-19 are leading to profound crises across the world. There is an urgent requirement for analyzing the current pandemic situation, predicting trends over time, and assessing the effectiveness of containment measures. Thus, numerous statistical models, primarily based on the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered or removed (SEIR) model, have been established. However, these models are highly technical, which are difficult for the public and governing bodies to understand and use. To address this issue, we developed a simple operating software based on our improved K-SEIR model termed as the kernel SEIR simulator (K-SEIR-Sim). This software includes natural propagation parameters, containment measure parameters, and certain characteristic parameters that can deduce the effects of natural propagation and containment measures. Further, the applicability of the proposed software was demonstrated using the examples of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, Wuhan city of China, Diamond Princess, and France. Operating results verified the potency of the proposed software in evaluating the epidemic situation and human intervention during COVID-19. Importantly, no installation is required and the software can perform real-time, backward-looking, and forward-looking analysis by functioning in data-driven and model-driven ways. All of them have considerable practical values in their applications according to the actual needs of personal use. Conclusively, K-SEIR-Sim is the first simple customized operating software that is highly valuable for the global fight against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The quest for suitable predictive models to improve realistic simulation of urban land use change has resulted in the use of several notable cellular automata calibrations. Cellular automata model has become very attractive and one of the strongest models for urban growth simulation due to its simplicity and possibility of evolution. However, the inability of cellular automata to include driving forces of urban growth in the simulation process has warranted further cellular automata calibrations to minimize this weakness. To address this problem, and contrary to previous cellular automata calibrations, this research presents a novel integration of support vector machine, Markov chain and cellular automata for urban change modelling. Support vector machine is introduced as a machine learning technique to mine the impact of the explanatory variables that drive urban change. Markov chain is employed to mine the urban transition probabilities between the various urban epochs while cellular automata are used to implement the incremental discrete time steps based on neighbourhood interaction from an initial time to a future time. This modelling is implemented using Landsat data acquired in 1984, 2000 and 2015 over Lagos in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous city. Urban transitions (1984–2000 and 2000–2015) are used to simulate future urban state in 2030 and validation metrics include McNemar's test. The introduction of stochasticity into the model helps create the typical randomness inherent in the real world for deriving future urban forms through discrete cellular automata iterations. The high accuracy obtained in this experiment implies a substantial fit between the predicted and reference data. This outcome proves the robustness of this method for modelling urban change.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While a range of methods has been used in the past for driving style classification, the emergence of connected vehicles equipped with communication devices provides a new opportunity to classify driving style using high-resolution (10 Hz) microscopic real-world data. In this study, location-based big data and machine learning are used to classify driving styles ranging from aggressive to calm. This classification can be used to customize driver assistance systems, assess mobility, crash risk, fuel consumption, and emissions. This study’s main objective is to develop a framework that harnesses Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) generated by connected vehicles to quantify instantaneous driving behavior and classify driving styles in different spatial contexts using unsupervised machine learning methods. To this end, a subset of the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) with more than 27 million BSM observations generated by more than 1300 individuals making trips on diverse roadways and through several neighborhoods in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were processed and analyzed. To quantify driving style, the concept of temporal driving volatility, as a surrogate safety measure of unsafe driving behavior, was utilized and applied to vehicle kinematics, i.e., observed speeds and longitudinal/lateral accelerations. Specifically, six volatility measures are extracted and used for classifying drivers. K-means and K-medoids methods are applied for grouping drivers in aggressive, normal, and calm clusters. Clustering results indicate that not only does driving style vary among drivers, but the thresholds for aggressive and calm driving vary across different roadway types due to variations in environment and road conditions. The proportion of aggressive driving styles was also higher on commercial streets than on highways and residential streets. Notably, we propose a Driving Score to measure driving performance consistently across drivers.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Considering, though, the substantial hurdles involved in collecting individual data for whole populations, this study introduces a first approach of simulating human movement and interaction behaviour, using Agent Based Modelling (ABM).
                  A city scale ABM was developed for urban Thessaloniki, Greece that feeds into population-based exposure assessment without imposing prior bias, basing its estimations onto emerging properties of the behaviour of the computerised autonomous decision makers (agents) that compose the city-system. Population statistics, road and buildings networks data were transformed into human, road and building agents, respectively. Survey outputs with time-use patterns were associated with human agent rules, aiming to model representative to real-world behaviours. Moreover, time-geography of exposure data, derived from a local sensors campaign, was used to inform and enhance the model. As a prevalence of an agent-specific decision-making, virtual individuals of different sociodemographic backgrounds express different spatiotemporal behaviours and their trajectories are coupled with spatially resolved pollution levels.
                  Personal exposure was evaluated by assigning PM concentrations to human agents based on coordinates, type of location and intensity of encountered activities. Study results indicated that PM2.5 inhalation adjusted exposure between housemates can differ by 56.5% whereas exposure between two neighbours can vary by as much as 87%, due to the prevalence of different behaviours.
                  This study provides details of a new methodology that permits the cost-effective construction of refined time-activity diaries and daily exposure profiles, taking into account different microenvironments and sociodemographic characteristics.

However, the dynamic nature of transportation traffic and increased data bandwidth demands are the major obstacles to achieve high transmission rate in Vehicular-to-Anything (V2X) Networks. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN)-controlled and Cognitive Radio (CR)-enabled V2X routing approach to achieve ultra-high data rate, by using predictive V2X routing that supports the intelligent switching between two 5G technologies: millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz). To improve the network management, Road Side units (RSUs) are used to segregate the V2X network into different clusters. Stability-aware clustering (SAC) scheme is also used for cluster formations. Our intelligent V2X is based on three features enabled machine learning approach: (1) To predict future 3D positions of the vehicles in the Cluster Heads (CHs) using Deep Neural Network with Extended Kalman Filter (DNN-EKF) algorithm for real-time, high-resolution prediction. (2) For THz communications, 0.3 THz to 3 THz band is selected for short-distance super-fast data transmissions. The THz band detection is performed by the CR-enabled Road Side Units (cRSUs). A Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based Improved Fruit Fly (GA-IFF) scheme is proposed to achieve an optimal route selection in THz communications.

This involves selection of the building form that minimizes wind loads and structural topologies that efficiently transfer loads. Current practice is to search for optimal shapes, but this limits buildings with static or fixed form. Aerodynamic shape tailoring that consists of modifying the external form of the building has shown great promise in reducing wind loads and associated structural motions as reflected in the design of Taipei 101 and Burj Khalifa. In these buildings, corner modifications of the cross-section and tapering along the height are introduced. An appealing alternative is to design a building that can adapt its form to the changing complex wind environment in urban areas with clusters of tall buildings, i.e., by implementing a dynamic facade. To leap beyond the static shape optimization, autonomous dynamic morphing of the building shape is advanced in this study, which is implemented through a cyber–physical system that fuses together sensing, computing, actuating, and engineering informatics.

Ageing is the primary contributor to a broad spectrum of chronic disorders all associated with a lower quality of life in the elderly. In 2019, the Chinese population constituted 18 % of the world population, with 164.5 million Chinese citizens aged 65 and above (65+), and 26 million aged 80 or above (80+). China has become an ageing society, and as it continues to age it will continue to exacerbate the burden borne by current family and public healthcare systems. Major healthcare challenges involved with caring for the elderly in China include the management of chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs), physical frailty, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, with emerging challenges such as providing sufficient dental care, combating the rising prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among nursing home communities, providing support for increased incidences of immune diseases, and the growing necessity to provide palliative care for the elderly. At the governmental level, it is necessary to make long-term strategic plans to respond to the pressures of an ageing society, especially to establish a nationwide, affordable, annual health check system to facilitate early diagnosis and provide access to affordable treatments. China has begun work on several activities to address these issues including the recent completion of the of the Ten-year Health-Care Reform project, the implementation of the Healthy China 2030 Action Plan, and the opening of the National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders. There are also societal challenges, namely the shift from an extended family system in which the younger provide home care for their elderly family members, to the current trend in which young people are increasingly migrating towards major cities for work, increasing reliance on nursing homes to compensate, especially following the outcomes of the ‘one child policy’ and the ‘empty-nest elderly’ phenomenon. At the individual level, it is important to provide avenues for people to seek and improve their own knowledge of health and disease, to encourage them to seek medical check-ups to prevent/manage illness, and to find ways to promote modifiable health-related behaviors (social activity, exercise, healthy diets, reasonable diet supplements) to enable healthier, happier, longer, and more productive lives in the elderly. Finally, at the technological or treatment level, there is a focus on modern technologies to counteract the negative effects of ageing. Researchers are striving to produce drugs that can mimic the effects of ‘exercising more, eating less’, while other anti-ageing molecules from molecular gerontologists could help to improve ‘healthspan’ in the elderly. Machine learning, ‘Big Data’, and other novel technologies can also be used to monitor disease patterns at the population level and may be used to inform policy design in the future. Collectively, synergies across disciplines on policies, geriatric care, drug development, personal awareness, the use of big data, machine learning and personalized medicine will transform China into a country that enables the most for its elderly, maximizing and celebrating their longevity in the coming decades.

This model is then integrated into a tool called My Air Quality Index (MyAQI), which is further implemented and evaluated in a real-life use case set up in Melbourne Urban Area (Victoria, Australia).

People can not only get a taxi anytime and anywhere, but also make an appointment for taxi in advance. Therefore, people are concerned about the current taxi capacity (i.e. the number of vacant taxis) around them. Meanwhile, they also want to know the future capacity to help them choose the appointment time to avoid congestion and plan their itinerary. However, most of the exiting studies only aim to help taxi companies to schedule traffic resources, and cannot consider future travel plans for users.

In order to explore more sufficient temporal relationship of data, DFSSTM models the temporal dynamics as three views: period, trend and closeness. Then the Siamese Spatial–Temporal Network (SSTN) is designed for each view, which introduces the Siamese architecture to capture the spatial–temporal dependencies of inflows and outflows simultaneously. Finally, DFSSTM automatically weights each view and fuses the outputs of the three views to get the final prediction.

It is caused by high concentrations of atmospheric air pollutants, such as dust, smoke and other particles that scatter and absorb sunlight. The poor visibility can result in the failure of multiple computer vision applications such as smart transport systems, image processing, object detection, surveillance etc. One of the major issues in the field of image processing is the restoration of images that are corrupted due to different degradations. Typically, the images or videos captured in the outside environment have low contrast, colour fade and restricted visibility due to suspended particles of the atmosphere that directly influence the image quality. This can cause difficulty in identifying the objects in the captured hazy images or frames. To address this problem, several image dehazing techniques have been developed in the literature, each of which has its own advantages and limitations, but effective image restoration remains a challenging task. In recent times, various learning (Machine learning & Deep learning) based methods greatly condensed the drawbacks of manual design of haze related features and reduces the difficulty in efficient restoration of images with less computational time and cost. The current state-of-the-art methods for haze free images, mainly from the last decade, are thoroughly examined in this survey. Moreover, this paper systematically summarizes the hardware implementations of various haze removal methods in real time.

Numerous ATSC algorithms have been proposed to accommodate real-time traffic conditions and optimize traffic efficiency. The common objective of these algorithms is to minimize total delay, decrease queue length, or maximize vehicle throughput. Despite their positive impacts on traffic mobility, the existing ATSC algorithms do not consider optimizing traffic safety. This is most likely due to the lack of tools to evaluate safety in real time. However, recent research has developed various real-time safety models for signalized intersections. These models can be used to evaluate safety in real time using dynamic traffic parameters, such as traffic volume, shock wave characteristics, and platoon ratio. Evaluating safety in real time can enable developing ATSC strategies for real-time safety optimization. In this paper, we present a novel self-learning ATSC algorithm to optimize the safety of signalized intersections. The algorithm was developed using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach and was trained using the simulation platform VISSIM. The trained algorithm was then validated using real-world traffic data obtained from two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Compared to the traditional actuated signal control system, the proposed algorithm reduces traffic conflicts by approximately 40 %. Moreover, the proposed ATSC algorithm was tested under various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs. The results showed that 90 % and 50 % of the algorithm’s safety benefits can be achieved at MPR values of 50 % and 30 %, respectively.

This framework relaxes assumptions in the literature by considering multiple origins and destinations, multiple access locations to the managed lane, en route diversion of travelers, partial observability of the sensor readings, and stochastic demand and observations. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and policy gradient methods are used to determine tolls as a function of real-time observations. Tolls are modeled as continuous and stochastic variables and are determined using a feedforward neural network. The method is compared against a feedback control method used for dynamic pricing. We show that Deep-RL is effective in learning toll policies for maximizing revenue, minimizing total system travel time, and other joint weighted objectives, when tested on real-world transportation networks. The Deep-RL toll policies outperform the feedback control heuristic for the revenue maximization objective by generating revenues up to 8.5% higher than the heuristic and for the objective minimizing total system travel time (TSTT) by generating TSTT up to 8.4% lower than the heuristic. We also propose reward shaping methods for the POMDP to overcome the undesired behavior of toll policies, like the jam-and-harvest behavior of revenue-maximizing policies.

In this study, we apply machine learning techniques to a dataset of 70 diesel vehicles tested in real-world driving conditions to: (i) cluster vehicles with similar emissions performance, and (ii) model instantaneous emissions. The application of dynamic time warping and clustering analysis by NOx emissions resulted in 17 clusters capturing 88% of trips in the dataset. We show that clustering effectively groups vehicles with similar emissions profiles, however no significant correlation between emissions and vehicle characteristics (i.e. engine size, vehicle weight) were found. For each cluster, we evaluate three instantaneous emissions models: a look-up table (LT) approach, a non-linear regression (NLR) model and a neural network multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. The NLR model provides accurate instantaneous NOx predictions, on par with the MLP: relative errors in prediction of emission factors are below 20% for both models, average fractional biases are −0.01 (s.d. 0.02) and −0.0003 (s.d. 0.04), and average normalised mean squared errors are 0.25 (s.d. 0.14) and 0.29 (s.d. 0.16), for the NLR and MLP models respectively.

Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate.

One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city’s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time.

Additionally, a model-driven graphical tool for security attack pattern definition and automatic code generation is provided, hiding all the complexity derived from implementation details from domain experts. The proposed architecture has been applied in the case of a healthcare IoT network to validate its ability to detect attacks made by malicious devices. The results obtained demonstrate that this architecture satisfactorily fulfils its objectives.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Ensuring efficient cleaning and disinfection (C&D) of equipment used for transport is needed to prevent the spread of AI. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy against the AI virus of C&D protocols applied on trucks and crates used for the transport of ducks during the H5N8 AI outbreaks in France in 2017. In 3 abattoirs, 16 transport vehicles and their crates were sampled by swabbing to detect the influenza type A genome by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Vehicles were tested before and after decontamination, which was carried out in accordance with the abattoirs' protocols. A total of 86 samples out of 299 collected before C&D were positive for AI (29%); 7 trucks out of 16 transported crates detected positive for AI. After C&D, the AI genome was detected in 56 samples out of 308 (18%). Ten trucks were loaded with a shipment of AI-positive crates. Eight vehicles were detected positive in the cabin, on the truck bed, and/or on the wheels. Despite reinforcement of C&D, the efficacy of decontamination was variable among slaughterhouses. The efficacy seemed to depend on the initial contamination load, C&D protocols, and how the protocol is implemented. Breaks in biosecurity measures led to frequent contamination of trucks after C&D. Observational studies during animal health crises are of interest to analyze practices in emergency conditions and to put forward measures aimed at increased preparedness.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Smart stormwater systems dynamically adapt their response to individual storms by controlling distributed assets, such as valves, gates, and pumps. This paper introduces a real-time control approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which has emerged as a state-of-the-art methodology for autonomous control in the artificial intelligence community. Using a Deep Neural Network, a RL-based controller learns a control strategy by interacting with the system it controls - effectively trying various control strategies until converging on those that achieve a desired objective. This paper formulates and implements a RL algorithm for the real-time control of urban stormwater systems. This algorithm trains a RL agent to control valves in a distributed stormwater system across thousands of simulated storm scenarios, seeking to achieve water level and flow set-points in the system. The algorithm is first evaluated for the control of an individual stormwater basin, after which it is adapted to the control of multiple basins in a larger watershed (4 km
                     2). The results indicate that RL can very effectively control individual sites. Performance is highly sensitive to the reward formulation of the RL agent. Generally, more explicit guidance led to better control performance, and more rapid and stable convergence of the learning process. While the control of multiple distributed sites also shows promise in reducing flooding and peak flows, the complexity of controlling larger systems comes with a number of caveats. The RL controller’s performance is very sensitive to the formulation of the Deep Neural Network and requires a significant amount of computational resource to achieve a reasonable performance enhancement. Overall, the controlled system significantly outperforms the uncontrolled system, especially across storms of high intensity and duration. A frank discussion is provided, which should allow the benefits and drawbacks of RL to be considered when implementing it for the real-time control of stormwater systems.

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented.

It can explore inner relationships between traffic conditions and crash risk, prevent potential crashes, and improve road safety. However, there exist some limitations in current studies on crash detection: (1) The commonly used machine learning methods cannot simulate the evolving transitions of traffic conditions before crash occurrences; (2) Current models collected traffic data of only one temporal resolution, which cannot fully represent traffic trends in different time intervals. Therefore, this study proposes a Long short-term memory (LSTM) based framework considering traffic data of different temporal resolutions (LSTMDTR) for crash detection. LSTM is an effective deep learning method to capture the long-term dependency and dynamic transitions of pre-crash conditions. Three LSTM networks considering traffic data of different temporal resolutions are constructed, which can comprehensively indicate traffic variations in different time intervals. A fully-connected layer is used to combine the outputs of three LSTM networks, and a dropout layer is used to reduce overfitting and improve prediction performance. The LSTMDTR model is implemented on datasets of I880-N and I805-N in California, America. The results indicate that the LSTMDTR model can obtain satisfactory performance on crash detection, with the highest crash accuracy of 70.43 %. LSTMDTR models constructed on one freeway can be transferred to other similar freeways, with 65.12 % of crash accuracy on transferability. Compared with machine learning methods and LSTM models with one or two temporal resolutions, the LSTMDTR model has been validated to perform better on crash detection and transferability. A proper number of neurons in the LSTMDTR model should be determined in real applications considering acceptable detection performance and computation time. The dropout technique can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the LSTMDTR model, increasing crash accuracy from 64.49 % to 70.43 %.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, one fundamental limitation of a Cloud is the connectivity with end devices. Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications.
                  In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise.

Photocatalysis has been proved able to mineralise most harmful contaminants. However, important problems associated with monitoring the efficiency of these solutions under real conditions still remain, including the lack of affordable analytical tools to measure NOx concentrations with enough accuracy. In this work, two pilot scale demonstration platforms were built at two different locations to assess the photocatalytic NOX removal efficiency of ten selected materials exposed outdoors for AQmesh low-cost sensor PODs were used to measure ground-level to measure NO and NO2 concentrations during nearly one year. The pollutant removal efficiency of the materials was then calculated based on a comparison with simultaneously concentration measurements carried-out on reference, non-active materials. It was found that the NO2 removal efficiency presented large variations across the seasons, with maxima during the warmer months, while NO efficiencies were comparatively steadier. Statistical analysis delivered evidence that the efficiencies significantly depend on different meteorological variables (irradiance and relative humidity) besides NO, NO2 ambient concentrations. Lower efficiencies were observed for higher concentration levels and vice versa. The influence of water vapour could be related to two different effects: a short-term contribution by the instantaneous air humidity and a long-term component associated with the hygroscopic state of the material.

As applications and software advances, processing and computational power become a concern to technology companies. With data risks and large numbers of connected devices, cloud computing has become outdated. Devices are forced to commit unnecessary expenses to stay relevant in the market due to the increase in software complexity. This need for change resulted in the introduction of edge computing. Edge computing distributes the computational strain between the server and the devices. This contribution allows the cloud to accommodate more users and devices are no longer in need to make significant changes to their design every so often.

For example, sound classification comes with massive computational needs due to its affiliation with neural networks and deep learning. This paper aims to create a feasible and deployable real-time sound classification system. There were three configurations tested in this paper. The results of our experiments show that cloud computing and edge computing alone cannot cater to a technological market that is exponentially growing in size and complexity. However, the same results show promise in finding optimal configurations in terms of a combination of end device power consumption, application runtime and server latency to systems instead of focusing on a single model.

At a more fine-grained level, CAPS focuses on the agent cognitive, reasoning and learning process in their surrounding environment, thus can exploit most advantages from cognitive computing and Artificial Intelligence.

The world will enjoy smart connectivity in the same way that the city of Barcelona has emerged to be the smartest city in the world. We are moving toward system-to-system connection, with smart networking reaching its peak. The idea of software-defined autonomous machines is about to become hugely important, which will become ubiquitous. With the advent of the IoT, we explore how it is becoming a reality and whether it has any limits.

In this work, a method is presented that is able to classify different road types and their conditions based on standard vehicle sensors. Therefore, training and validation data on two routes in urban traffic and on federal highways was gathered using a Volkswagen Golf GTE Plug-In Hybrid. The method uses features based on both frequency and time domain extended with a physical vehicle sub-model. For the classification a decision tree model is trained offline and implemented for online use on target hardware commonly used in modern vehicles. A Bayesian and Markov based filter is used to smooth the output and increase the accuracy of the classification.

Results show promising classification performance, especially for classifying cobblestone.

However, especially in developing countries where the motorcycle is the main form of transportation, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the safety-critical behavioral metric of motorcycle helmet use. This lack of data prohibits targeted enforcement and education campaigns which are crucial for injury prevention. Hence, we have developed an algorithm for the automated registration of motorcycle helmet usage from video data, using a deep learning approach. Based on 91,000 annotated frames of video data, collected at multiple observation sites in 7 cities across the country of Myanmar, we trained our algorithm to detect active motorcycles, the number and position of riders on the motorcycle, as well as their helmet use. An analysis of the algorithm's accuracy on an annotated test data set, and a comparison to available human-registered helmet use data reveals a high accuracy of our approach. Our algorithm registers motorcycle helmet use rates with an accuracy of −4.4% and +2.1% in comparison to a human observer, with minimal training for individual observation sites. Without observation site specific training, the accuracy of helmet use detection decreases slightly, depending on a number of factors.

Therefore, we need technological means to optimally manage of the waste collection process, which represents 70% of the operational cost in waste treatment. In this article, we present a free intelligent software system called BIN-CT (BIN for the CiTy), based on computational learning algorithms, which plans the best routes for waste collection supported by past (historical) and future (predictions) data.
                  The objective of the system is to reduction the cost of the waste collection service minimizing the distance traveled by a truck to collect the waste from a container, thereby reducing the fuel consumption. At the same time the quality of service for the citizen is increased, avoiding the annoying overflows of containers thanks to the accurate fill-level predictions given by BIN-CT. In this article we show the features of our software system, illustrating its operation with a real case study of a Spanish city. We conclude that the use of BIN-CT avoids unnecessary trips to containers, reduces the distance traveled to collect a container by 20%, and generates routes 33.2% shorter than the routes used by the company.

The anaerobic digestion process is the industry standard technology for biogas production due to its lowered energy consumption and its reliance on microbiology. Even in such an environmental-friendly process, liquid digestate is still produced from the remains of digested bio-feedstock and will require treatment. With unsuitable treatment procedure for liquid digestate, the mass of bio-feedstock can potentially escape the circular supply chain within the economy. This paper recommends the implementation of evaporator systems to provide a sustainable liquid digestate treating mechanism within the economy. Studied evaporator systems are represented by vacuum evaporation in combination with ammonia scrubber, stripping and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, complex multi-dimensional decisions should be made by stakeholders before implementing such systems. Our work utilizes a novel techno-economics model to study the techno-economics robustness in implementing recent state-of-art vacuum evaporation systems with exploitation of waste heat from combined heat and power (CHP) units in biogas plants (BGP). To take into the account the stochasticity of the real world and robustness of the analysis, we used the Monte-Carlo simulation technique to generate more than 20,000 of different possibilities for the implementation of the evaporation system. Favourable decision pathways are then selected using a novel methodology which utilizes the artificial neural network and a hyper-optimized decision tree classifier. Two pathways that give the highest probability of providing a fast payback period are identified. Descriptive statistics are also used to analyse the distributions of decision parameters that lead to success in implementing the evaporator system. The results highlighted that integration of evaporation system are favourable when transport costs and incentives for CHP units are large and while feed-in tariffs for electricity production and specific investment costs are low. The result of this work is expected to pave the way for BGP stakeholders and decision makers in implementing liquid digestate treating technologies within the currently existing infrastructure.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This would be impractical, because missing data may occur randomly. In this study, we propose a novel tensor-based algorithm, specifically, an iterative tensor decomposition (ITD) approach, that utilizes multidimensional inherent correlation of traffic data to detect and impute missing data in the ANPR system. The proposed algorithm is tested with a real-world ANPR system dataset. The experimental results show that missing data from the ANPR system can be classified into three cases, i.e., no missing, random elements missing, and extreme missing.

However, research challenges of re-identification remain especially in terms of recognizing the different appearances of the same person in a harsh real-world environment: (1) the adaptability of the selected features to the dynamic environment cannot be guaranteed, and (2) existing methods rooted from metric learning aim to find a single metric function, and they lack the ability to measure the different appearances of the same person. To address these problems, this study proposes a multiple deep metric learning method empowered by the functionality of person similarity probability measurement. The proposed method exploits multiple stacked auto-encoder networks and classification networks to quantify pedestrians’ similarity relations. The stacked auto-encoder networks directly recognize persons from surveillance images at the pixel level. The classification networks are equipped with the Softmax regression models and produce multiple similarity probabilities to characterize different appearances belonging to the same person. An Adaboost-like model is designed to fuse the probabilities corresponding to multiple metrics, which ensures a high accuracy of recognition. Experimental results on two public datasets (VIPeR and CUHK-01) indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms by 2%–10% at rank 1.

However, with NFV comes numerous challenges related mainly to the complexity of deploying and adjusting VNFs in the physical networks, owing to the huge number of nodes and links in today's datacenters, and the inter-dependency among VNFs forming a certain network service. Several contributions have been made in an attempt to answer these challenges, where most of the existing solutions focus on the static placement of VNFs and overlook the dynamic aspect of the problem, which arises mainly due to the ever-changing resource availability in the cloud datacenters and the continuous mobility of the users. Few attempts have been lately made to incorporate the dynamic aspect to the VNF deployment solutions. The main problem of these approaches lies in their reactive readjustment scheme which determines the placement/migration strategy upon the receipt of a new request or the happening of a certain event, thus resulting in high setup latencies. In this paper, we take advantage of machine learning to reduce the complexity of the placement and readjustment processes through designing a cluster-based proactive solution. The solution consists of (1) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that considers a tradeoff between the minimization of the latency, Service-Level Objective (SLO) violation cost, hardware utilization, and VNF readjustment cost, (2) an optimized k-medoids clustering approach which proactively partitions the substrate network into a set of disjoint on-demand clusters and (3) data-driven cluster-based placement and readjustment algorithms that capitalize on machine learning to intelligently eliminate some cost functions from the optimization problem to boost its feasibility in large-scale networks. Simulation results show that the proposed solution considerably reduces the readjustment time and decrease the hardware utilization compared to the K-means, original k-medoids and migration without clustering approaches.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

But, at the same time, and without the need to develop and add any subsequent code, they should be a valuable support for the phases and tasks of exploitation: maintenance, machine or system learning, etc. The problem is that the requirements for first development phases are much more generic than those for later phases.

With the advent of large quantities of machine-generated data, the use of standardized data formats feeds opportunities for visualization and advanced applications with machine-learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The transportation industry made substantial progress with data format specifications in the late 1990s, primarily for highway traffic. Unfortunately, establishing data standards has been an on-going challenge for the transit community.

Recent advancements in electronic transit scheduling (e.g., General Transit Feed Specifications (GTFS)) met a portion of this challenge with Open Data specifications. Now GTFS provides transit riders with agile information on services available at any location where the data is provided to developers of mobile device application (apps).

The objective of this study is to establish a coupled stochastic continuous multi-lane car-following model using Langevin equations to cope with probabilistic characteristics of LC manoeuvres. In particular, a stochastic volatility, derived from LC manoeuvres is introduced in a multi-lane stochastic optimal velocity model (SOVM).

Furthermore, imaged second-based trajectories of the lane-changer and surrounding vehicles are used to identify whether LC manoeuvres occur by using the CNN.

The inclusion of genetic operators in the cuckoo search algorithm leads to a rigorous search of the solution space, finding the best feasible schedule that can execute tasks in the lowest time, which in turn reduces the total resources usage cost. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested by using real-time tasks that need data files for successful completion.

The air quality evaluation consists of three experimenting protocols: a) first, we installed fixed passive tubes for monitoring the nitrogen dioxide concentrations placed in strategic locations highly affected by traffic circulation in an eco-neighbourhood, b) second, we monitored the nitrogen dioxide registered by citizens using smart and mobile pollution units carried at breathing level; results revealed that mobile-captured concentrations were 3–5 times higher than the ones registered by passive-static monitoring tubes and c) third, we compared different mobile pollution stations working simultaneously, which revealed noticeable differences in terms of result variability and sensitivity. Finally, we applied a machine learning modelling by using decision trees and neural networks on the mobile-generated data and show that humidity and noise are the most important factors influencing the prediction of nitrogen dioxide concentrations of mobile stations.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This study evaluated the efficacy of online bacterial counting for continuous monitoring of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes to remove bacteria using real-time bacteriological commercial counters and an on-site pilot-scale RO system. Prior to on-site assessments, the online bacterial counting was verified by comparing the measurement of fluorescent particles in water with flow cytometry. During a seven day pilot test of RO treatment at a water reclamation plant, online bacterial counts in RO permeate were monitored below 15 counts/mL; whereas the bacterial counts in RO feed water were approximately 2500 to 10,000 counts/mL. Removal rates of bacterial counts ranged from 2.6 to 3.1-log (average = 2.9-log) by continuously monitoring bacterial removal. This is greater than a 2-log reduction frequently determined using other water quality surrogates (i.e., electrical conductivity). Overall, the continuous monitoring of bacteria in RO feed and permeate can be implemented without the addition of chemicals to provide near real-time bacterial counts to measure their reduction after RO treatment. This can be developed for continuous performance monitoring of the RO process, providing greater assurance of microbial water quality after RO treatment.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, most of the previous studies attempting to build traffic flow forecasting models focus on short-term forecasting as the next step. In this paper, a deep feature leaning approach is proposed to predict short-term traffic flow in the following multiple steps using supervised learning techniques. To achieve traffic flow forecasting for the next day, an advanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize some parameters in deep belief networks. The modified model can boost the accuracy of the forecasting results and enhance its multiple step prediction ability. Using real-time and historical temporal–spatial traffic data, day-ahead prediction experiment is implemented. The results of the hybrid model are compared with several commonly used benchmark models and some improved deep neural network based on evaluation criteria. Also, the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the significance in the number of hidden layers is analyzed. When the layers are increasing more than 4, the performance of the proposed model stops improving significantly. The results indicate the proposed model can extract complex features of traffic flow and therefore the forecasting accuracy and stability can be effectively improved.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The developed fuzzy expert system is coded in C language integrated production system (CLIPS) and is linked with MATLAB software for calling fuzzy functions. A real case study of gas pressure reduction stations in Iranian gas industry is conducted to validate the proposed expert system model. The expert system provides more than one thousand rules based on expert knowledge to prevent the pressure drop and the quality loss of gas or shutting off gas flow which accordingly increases gas flow stability.

Yet, despite this statistic, the regular commute of drivers is often predictable, leading many federal projects to aim at alleviating congestion through traveler information and intelligent transportation systems (e.g., INFLO, Queue WARN, CACC, EnableATIS, ATIS2.0). Short-term destination prediction is a developing field of research that can improve these approaches through real-traveler information, such as route, traffic incidence, and congestion levels. The short-term destination prediction problem consists of capturing vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) traces and learning from historic locations and trajectories to predict a vehicle's destination. Drivers have predictable trip destinations that can be estimated through probabilistic modeling of past trips. To study these concepts, a database of GPS driving traces (260 participants for 70 days) was collected. To model the user's trip purpose in the prediction algorithm, a new data source was explored: point of interest (POI)/land use data. An open source land use/POI dataset is merged with the GPS dataset. The resulting database includes over 20,000 trips with travel characteristics and land use/POI data. From land use/POI data and travel patterns, trip purpose was calculated with machine learning methods. To take advantage of this data source, a new prediction model structure was developed that uses trip purpose when it is available and that falls back on traditional spatial temporal Markov models when it is not. For the first time, there is an understanding of “why” a trip is taken (not just “where” and “when”), allowing the use of “why” in the prediction model. This paper explores the baseline model followed by the inclusion of trip purpose. First, a baseline tiered time origin model was developed using the Markov Chain approach. This modelling structure allows for a short training period of current modeling techniques. The other major advantage to this structure is it allows for easy implementation of the trip purpose module. Then, a machine learning technique derived the trip purpose on 5-, 15- and 30-trip learning sets, followed by results organized by purpose, time, and origin. The machine learning technique does not require future land use data and is feasible for applicable use. This model is the first to use trip purpose to make a short-term destination prediction in pseudo real-time. Results show improved accuracy and speed over the current start-of-trip destination prediction models.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we propose using the DA methodology based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to improve the accuracy of microstructure prediction using three-dimensional multi-phase-field (3D-MPF) model and estimate the model parameters simultaneously. To demonstrate the applicability of the DA methodology, we performed numerical experiments in which a priori assumed true parameters related to the grain boundary (GB) energy cusp and GB mobility peak of Σ7 coincidence site lattice GB were estimated from synthetic data of time-evolving polycrystalline microstructure. Four model parameters related to the Σ7 GB properties were successfully estimated by assimilating the synthetic microstructure data to the 3D-MPF model predictions using the EnKF-based DA method. Furthermore, we accurately reproduced the preliminarily assumed true shapes of GB energy cusp and GB mobility peak by using the estimated parameters. The results suggest that implementation of the EnKF-based DA method in the MPF model has great potential for identifying unknown material properties and estimating unmeasurable microstructure evolutions in polycrystalline materials based on real time-series 3D microstructure observation data.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By creative design of scenarios we mean the process of imagining situations and describing them through models and stories. The framework supports the tasks of gathering and organizing knowledge about emergency management situations by automatically generating conceptual models, related to fragments of emergency scenarios. It leverages semantics-based techniques to enable a computational creativity approach. A software application was defined to support the activities of modeling scenarios by permitting to generate, organize, and query sets of these conceptual models, which we name mini-stories, and that can be adopted to inspire the activity of creative design. Selected mini-stories are blueprints for more detailed user scenario descriptions and models that can be used, for instance, for analysis or simulation. As a case study, we consider emergency management in smart cities. This is a challenging domain because smart cities are characterized by interconnected physical and virtual services forming complex ecosystems, which provide sophisticated services to the population and to institutions, manage public resources in a optimal way, and involve citizens in decisional processes. As a consequence, smart city ecosystems can be threatened by several hazards spanning from natural disasters, as tsunami and earthquakes, to anthropic events, as terrorist attacks. Ability of service providers and institutional operators to face and manage emergency situations is therefore a relevant issue. Simulation and analysis of both crisis events and executions of management plans are a promising approach to deal with these articulated problems. However, manual definition of models to base the analysis is a demanding activity due to the huge number of different situations to consider. It requires knowledge related to the crisis and emergency domains, to the context (e.g., a specific city and its current regulations) and ability in modeling tasks. All these aspects demand for tools to support modeling activities, and our proposal aims at fulfilling this need. In particular, the discussed framework uses in a integrated way three types of knowledge: structural knowledge, to support the construction of models based on design patterns; domain knowledge, here related to smart cities and emergency management and represented by means of ontologies; and contextual knowledge, related to specific aspects (e.g., localization) of the considered scenario and represented as rules.

Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning.

This interest is further fueled by the emergence of e-commerce, where many applications can benefit from autonomous package delivery solutions. However, the environment stochasticity, variability and task complexity for autonomous operation make it difficult to deploy such systems in real-world applications without the incorporation of advanced machine learning and optimization algorithms. Moving away from designing a “one size fits all” agent to solve the outdoor package delivery problem and considering ad-hoc teams of agents trained within a data-driven framework could provide the answer. In this work, we propose a delivery scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) formulation. Specifically, a 3-index mixed integer program-based PDP that allows coalition formation (PDP-CF) among agents is derived to allow multi-agent PDP schedules. We propose a quantum genetic algorithm to solve for the schedule since it is can better handle the large computational complexity of PDP-CF.

An RL-based controller is developed by representing traffic states as graph-structured data and customizing corresponding neural network architectures to handle those data. The customizations enable the controller to: (i) model neighborhood-wide traffic based on directed-graph representations; (ii) use the representations to identify patterns in real-time traffic measurements; and (iii) capture those patterns to a spatial representation needed for selecting optimal cordon-metering rates. Input to the selection process also includes a total inflow to be admitted through a cordon. The rate is optimized in a separate process that is not part of the present work. Our RL-controller distributes that separately-optimized rate across the signalized street links that feed traffic through the cordon. The resulting metering rates vary from one feeder link to the next. The selection process can reoccur at short time intervals in response to changing traffic patterns. Once trained on a few cordons, the RL-controller can be deployed on cordons elsewhere in a city without additional training.
                  This portability feature is confirmed via simulations of traffic on an idealized street network. The tests also indicate that the controller can reduce the network’s vehicle hours traveled well beyond what can be achieved via spatially-uniform cordon metering.

Under the coordination of logistics services providers or logistics facilities of the existing network, high operating costs caused by cross and long distance transportation can be reduced via the inclusive reorganization of the entire network. In order to minimize the total cost, this study simultaneously considers semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing, and establishes a linear mathematical model capable of interpreting real world practices under single or multiple alliances scenarios. An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm are reasonably combined into a hybrid meta-heuristics to solve the cooperative 2E-LDPN optimization problem. This algorithm combines the merits of IPSO and ACO with local and global search capabilities, and redistributes customer zones on the basis of region partitioning solutions in order to rationalize transportation activities. Finally, an Improved Shapley value model is applied to guarantee profits allocation's fairness and is proved reliable in term of alliance stability. Empirical results out of a case study in Chongqing city show that the IPSO–ACO hybrid algorithm is superior to three well-known algorithms on the cost solution and the number of iterations. Using the Improved Shapley value model and strictly monotonic path (SMP) selection principles, optimal adhesion sequences for two alliances and a grand alliance are yielded. The implemented transition from two sub-alliances based network to the grand alliance is in line with real-world's practices and provides decision makers with a useful tool for the design of cooperative alliances. In addition, the proposed cooperation strategy and profit allocation method enable companies to increase cost savings and the logistics network's efficiency.

Given the increasing popularity of these devices, their high processing power, and the ability to transfer data over wireless networks, different smartphone-based applications have emerged in the last years to solve old problems with new approaches more efficiently and cheaply. One example is the assessment and monitoring of asphalt quality. This task has been done manually by experts since the 1930s, and with the help of expensive equipment since the 1960s. Currently, we are experiencing the emergence of next-generation tools to perform this monitoring with smartphones, significantly reducing costs, time, and effort of experts.

E-Water aims at providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mékrou river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland.
                  In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization.
                  To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and hypothetical scenarios in the Mékrou river basin. The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income.
                  The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic management strategies for nutrients and water.

In order to meet these expectations, many transport operators are already offering free mobile apps to help customers better plan their journeys and access real-time travel information. Leveraging the spatio-temporal data that such apps can produce at scale (i.e. timestamped GPS traces), opens an opportunity to bridge the gap between passenger expectations and capabilities of the operators by providing a real-time 360-degree view of the transport network based on the ‘Apps as infrastructure’ paradigm. The first step towards fulfilling this vision is to understand which routes and services the passengers are travelling on at any given time. Mapping a GPS trace onto a particular transport network is known as ‘network matching’. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a supervised sequence classification task, where sequences are made of geographic coordinates, time, and line and direction of travel as the label. We present and compare two data-driven approaches to this problem: (i) a heuristic algorithm, which looks for nearby stops and makes an estimation based on their timetables — used as a baseline — and (ii) a deep learning approach using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Since RNNs require considerable amounts of data to train a good model, and collecting and labelling this data from real users is a challenging task, one of our contributions is a synthetic journey data generator. The datasets that we generated have been made as realistic as possible by querying real timetables and adding position and temporal noise to simulate variable GPS accuracy and vehicle delays, sampled from empirical distributions estimated using thousands of real location reports. To validate our approach we have used a separate dataset made of hundreds of real user journeys provided by a UK-based bus operator. Our experimental results are very promising and our next step is to deploy the solution in a production environment. From the operator’s point of view, this will enable multiple smart applications like account-based ticketing, identification of disruptions, real-time passenger counting, and network analysis.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To achieve this goal, RL-Probe leverages both synchronous and asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility. Our solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring procedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing operations.

                  This study sought to assess the prevalence and prognostic value of abnormalities in left atrial (LA) phasic volumes and reservoir function in a community cohort.
               
                  Background
                  LA enlargement is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Real-time 3-dimensional (RT3D) echocardiography allows assessment of LA phasic volumes and reservoir function. However, there is a paucity of data regarding normal values, clinical correlates, and prognostic value of RT3D echocardiography-derived LA phasic volumes and reservoir function, especially in the elderly, a subgroup at high risk for cardiovascular events.
               
                  Methods
                  Left atrial maximum volume (LAVimax), minimum volume (LAVimin), and reservoir function assessed as emptying volume (LAEV), emptying fraction (LAEF), and expansion index (LAEI), were measured by RT3D echocardiography in participants from a community-based cohort study. Cut-off values for LA phasic volumes were derived from a healthy subgroup of participants free of cardiovascular disease and risk factors (n = 142; 66 ± 9 years of age; 55% women). Annual follow-up examinations were performed for cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular death).
               
                  Results
                  The cohort included 706 participants (71 ± 9 years of age; 59% women). LAVimax and LAVimin were not associated with age in the healthy subgroup but progressively increased with age in the entire cohort (p < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 7 years (minimum 0.06, maximum 9.5 years), 78 cardiovascular events occurred. In univariate analysis, LAVimax, LAVimin, and reservoir function parameters were significantly associated with outcome. In multivariate analysis, LAVimin ≥20.5 ml/m2 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.02 to 3.16) and LAEV ≤5.7 ml/m2 (aHR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.85) remained significantly associated with events. LAVimin and LA reservoir function showed incremental prognostic value over that of LAVimax.
               
                  Conclusions
                  LA phasic volumes and reservoir functions assessed by RT3D echocardiography were strong independent predictors of cardiovascular events in a community-based elderly cohort. LAVimin and reservoir function assessment may improve cardiovascular outcome prediction over LAVimax.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

                  On occasions, a surgical intervention can be associated with serious, potentially life-threatening complications. One of these complications is a haemorrhage during the operation, an unsolved issue that could delay the intervention or even cause the patient's death. On laparoscopic surgery this complication is even more dangerous, due to the limited vision and mobility imposed by the minimally invasive techniques.
               
                  Methods
                  In this paper it is described a computer vision algorithm designed to analyse the images captured by a laparoscopic camera, classifying the pixels of each frame in blood pixels and background pixels and finally detecting a massive haemorrhage. The pixel classification is carried out by comparing the parameter B/R and G/R of the RGB space colour of each pixel with a threshold obtained using the global average of the whole frame of these parameters. The detection of and starting haemorrhage is achieved by analysing the variation of the previous parameters and the amount of pixel blood classified.
               
                  Results
                  When classifying in vitro images, the proposed algorithm obtains accuracy over 96%, but during the analysis of an in vivo images obtained from real operations, the results worsen slightly due to poor illumination, visual interferences or sudden moves of the camera, obtaining accuracy over 88%. The detection of haemorrhages directly depends of the correct classification of blood pixels, so the analysis achieves an accuracy of 78%.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The proposed algorithm turns out to be a good starting point for an automatic detection of blood and bleeding in the surgical environment which can be applied to enhance the surgeon vision, for example showing the last frame previous to a massive haemorrhage where the incision could be seen using augmented reality capabilities.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This chapter presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings in aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples.

Finally, we provide a performance evaluation at pixel level using different classifiers. This evaluation is conducted over 200 buildings using different segmentation algorithms and descriptors. The performance analysis quantifies the quality of both the image segmentation and the descriptor used.

Natural resources, such as energy and water, enable economy growth and support quality of life. The Water-Energy Nexus is considered as one of the most important multidisciplinary challenges [2] that the global growing water market [3] has to face in the forthcoming years. Currently, many water systems are not managed sustainably enough. Water Utilities face other challenges, such as infrastructure aging and poor cost-recovery, leading to a lack of finance for O&M (Operation and Maintenance). Energy is required in all stages of water production and distribution, from pumping and treatment to transportation. Energy costs are a top-of-mind concern for water utilities, regardless of geography, size and level of water network efficiency [4]. On the other hand, Water Utilities are having a hard time to either improve their services or expand their network to unserved neighborhoods in developing countries.
                  The current trend of water transmission system to the creation of DMAs (District Metered Areas) offers great possibilities of non-structural solutions that use existing data and transform them into useful information to support decision making. The Smart Metering and the use of large amounts of data from a network enhance the use of software for decision support, but it is not the only way. Smart Solutions can also be applied to networks with less recorded data, which would enhance operators’ knowledge to these data, turn them into useful information for decision-making either for the operation or the maintenance and network design. In this scope, a Smart Solution is presented. It is developed combining key factors of the energy consumption and the water supply into water networks management to obtain improvements from both water and energy fields. This non-structural solution increases resource efficiency and environmental performance of water distribution networks by using data acquisition and geographical visualization (real time & historical), weather and water demand forecasting, detection of networks events and hydraulic simulation of the network, and finally through a decision support system based on machine learning (pattern recognition and business rules techniques).
                  As a conclusion, a non-structural solution for the Nexus issues can have a great impact on several matters (climate change, carbon footprint, WUs balance sheets, and water losses) with reasonable investment either in smart metering or networks with only a few sensors measuring.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The main goal of this article is to make a high-precision prediction on four kinds of merging behaviors at expressway on-ramp bottlenecks. Based on the videos of traffic flow at two on-ramp bottlenecks at Yan’an Expressway in Shanghai, 403 empirical samples are collected by extracting trajectories from merging vehicles, as well as each adjacent one using trajectory processing software. A learning-based support vector machine (SVM) approach is adopted to predict the various merging behaviors. Considering four merging behaviors have different degrees of merging risk and effect on the mainline traffic flow, three SVM models are established. To overcome the potential over-fitting problem, variance analysis is used to extract the key variables in each model. The results show that the SVM models perform well. The highest prediction accuracy in the binary-classification models reaches up to nearly 90% followed by 80.10% in the multi-classification model. Besides, the results of SVM models are compared with several frequently used models, including discrete choice model, Bayesian network and classification and regression tree.

The safety and reliability of a ship's work rely strongly on the performance of such an engine; therefore, early detection of any type of failure that affects the engine is of crucial importance. Automatic diagnostic systems are of special importance because they can operate continuously in real time, thereby providing efficient monitoring of the engine's performance. We introduce a fully automatic machine learning-based system for engine fault detection. For this purpose, we monitor various signals that are emitted by the engine, and we use them as an input for a pattern classification algorithm. This action is realized by an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines that work in a decomposition mode. Because we address 14 different faults and a correct operation mode, we must handle a 15-class problem. We tackle this task by binarization in one-vs-one mode, where each Extreme Learning Machine is trained on a pair of classes. Next, Error-Correcting Output Codes are used to reconstruct the original multi-class task. The results from experiments that were conducted on a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers superior classification accuracy and a low response time in comparison with a number of state-of-the-art methods and thus is a suitable choice for a real-life implementation on board a ship.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, results in the field are mostly theoretical, proven to account for stricter hit rate and latency requirements in specific environments. They generally assume that two devices being in proximity automatically see one-another, an assumption which might not stand under real-world conditions (Bluetooth assumes a peering session and close-proximity, WiFi Direct implementations are different between manufacturers, etc.).
                  Our previous studies in the area show that WiFi is still the most feasible media for opportunistic contacts. WiFi-enabled devices, with out-of-the-box networking capabilities, can connect in an ad-hoc opportunistic network, over wireless routers, and thus support a cyber-physical infrastructure for opportunistically spreading information.

The algorithm is based on properly balancing signal strength, latency, bandwidth, and, most importantly, the number of friends predicted to connect to the respective access point.

Among different mono-dimensional time-series models, a seasonal autoregressive moving average model (SARMA) is selected for comparison. The time-series model is also used in a hybrid modeling framework to provide the Bayesian network with an a priori estimation of the predicted speed, which is then corrected exploiting the information collected on other links. A large floating car data set on a sub-area of the road network of Rome is used for validation. To account for the variable accuracy of the speed estimated from floating car data, a new error indicator is introduced that relates accuracy of prediction to accuracy of measure. Validation results highlighted that the spatial architecture of the Bayesian network is advantageous in standard conditions, where a priori knowledge is more significant, while mono-dimensional time series revealed to be more valuable in the few cases of non-recurrent congestion conditions observed in the data set.

Monitoring of viruses that are frequently present in contaminated coastal environments, such as rotavirus (RoV) and norovirus (NoV), which are also the major cause of human viral gastroenteritis, is essential to ensure the safe use of these water bodies. Since exposure to as few as 10–100 particles of RoV or NoV may induce gastrointestinal disease, there is a need to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for their detection in coastal water samples. In this study, we evaluate the application of methacrylate monolithic chromatographic columns, commercially available as convective interaction media (CIM®), to concentrate pathogenic enteric viruses from saline water samples prior to virus quantification by one-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Using RoV and NoV as model enteric viruses, we present our results on the most effective viral concentration conditions from saline water matrices using butyl (C4) hydrophobic interaction monolithic support (CIM® C4). C4 monolithic columns exhibit a good capacity to bind both RoV and NoV and both viruses can be eluted in a single step. Our protocol using a 1 ml C4 column enables processing of 400 ml saline water samples in less than 60 min and increases the sensitivity of RoV and NoV detection by approximately 50-fold and 10-fold respectively. The protocol was also scaled up using larger capacity 8 ml C4 columns to process 4000 ml of seawater samples with concentration factors of 300-fold for RoV and 40-fold for NoV, without any significant increase in processing time. Furthermore, C4 monolithic columns were adapted for field use in an on-site application of RoV concentration from seawater samples with performance equivalent to that of the reference laboratory setup.

More specifically, by obtaining the feature matrix from a sliding window, we use multiple mapping vectors to project the original feature matrix into different mask spaces. Inspired by the part-based model [12], it is natural to formulate the pedestrian detection into a multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework. Afterward, we adopt an MI-SVM [9] to solve it.

In comparison with current operations, SPO require higher cognitive efforts, which potentially result in increased human error rates. This article proposes a novel Cognitive Pilot-Aircraft Interface (CPAI) concept, which introduces adaptive knowledge-based system functionalities to assist single pilots in the accomplishment of mission-essential and safety-critical tasks in modern commercial transport aircraft. The proposed CPAI system implementation is based on real-time detection of the pilot’s physiological and cognitive states, allowing the avoidance of pilot errors and supporting enhanced synergies between the human and the avionics systems. These synergies yield significant improvements in the overall performance and safety levels. A CPAI working process consisting of sensing, estimation and reconfiguration steps is developed to support the assessment of physiological and external conditions, a dynamic allocation of tasks and adaptive alerting. Suitable mathematical models are introduced to estimate the mental demand associated to each piloting task and to assess the pilot cognitive states. Suitably implemented decision logics allow a continuous and optimal adjustment of the automation levels as a function of the estimated cognitive states. Representative numerical simulation test cases provide a preliminary validation of the CPAI concept. In particular, the continuous adaptation of the flight deck's automation successfully maintains the pilot's task load within an optimal range, mitigating the onset of hazardous fatigue levels.

This paper presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings on aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples.

Accurate prediction of the resource availability assists efficient resource allocation before the routing of such data. Most of the published work on resource prediction in MANET focuses on either bandwidth or energy without considering mobility effects. Adoption of intelligent software agent such as Cognitive Agent (CA) for the accurate resource prediction has a significant potential to solve the challenges of resource prediction in MANET. The intelligence provided in CA is similar to the logical thinking like a human for decision-making. The predominant CA architecture is the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, which performs the various tasks on behalf of the human user as an assistant.

Agents predict the traffic, mobility, buffer space, energy, and bandwidth effectively that is necessary for efficient resource allocation to support real-time and multimedia communications. The mobile agents collect and distribute network traffic statistics over MANET whereas a static agent collects the local statistics. CA creates static/mobile agent during the process of resource prediction. Initially, the designed time-series Wavelet Neural Networks (WNNs) predict traffic and mobility. Buffer space, energy, and bandwidth prediction use the predicted mobility and traffic. Simulation results show that the predicted resources closely match with the real values at the cost of little overheads due to the usage of agents.

The way we choose to address this challenge as a society will have far-reaching impacts, for instance, on public health, national security, and the global climate. The interactions between the food, water, and energy systems offer us an opportunity to improve efficiency, but can also make the system more complex. Cognitive systems can help mitigate this complexity and thus improve efficiency.
                  What food, water, and energy have in common is that they are often not produced where they are consumed, they are costly to transport, and they are hard to store efficiently in large quantities. And this is where cognitive computing comes in: if you cannot store a resource you must have good forecasts of supply and demand. This requires handling large scale datasets from multiple sources, using machine learning methods to build forecasting models, and leveraging optimization techniques to help incorporate forecasting results into a decision-making process.
                  We will use energy as an example throughout the bulk of this chapter with the understanding that the same methods, challenges, and solutions can be applied more broadly to food, water, and other constrained resources.
                  
                     Sense: We will first discuss methods to make the most of sensor data. For example, it is expensive to deploy large networks of ground sensors (e.g., weather stations), and it is therefore beneficial to make use of sensors that can cover large areas, like radar or satellite images. However, it is challenging to estimate ground conditions based on satellite measurements alone. We will discuss machine learning algorithms that can learn the mapping from wide area sensor data to local conditions based on only a few ground-truth measurements. Applications include, for example, to estimate rainfall based on radar measurements, or to estimate solar power generation based on satellite images of clouds.
                  
                     Predict: Next, we will discuss forecasting methods ranging from a few minutes ahead to days or even years ahead. We will discuss forecasting methods for energy demand, solar energy generation, and wind generation. Different methods are effective for these different technologies as well as different forecasting horizons. Very short-range forecasts might use autoregressive models, while mid- to long-range forecasts may require physical models. We also discuss hybrid methods that combine expert knowledge with machine learning.
                  
                     React: Finally, we will discuss how to use the outputs of these analytics tools to serve decision-making processes. How optimization can help improve infrastructure planning and economic dispatch of power generation. And how cognitive systems can help system operators to make sense of messy data from multiple sources, provide recommended actions, and enable better decision making.
                  We will highlight several different mathematical methods, including autoregressive models, generalized additive models, fully connected neural networks, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and nonlinear optimization in the context of energy.

The integrated system that this paper presents deals with two aspects that have been identified as key topics: safety and efficiency. To this end, the development and implementation of an integrated advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for rural and intercity environments is proposed. The system focuses mainly on single-carriageways roads, given the complexity of these environments compared to motorways and the high number of severe and fatal accidents on them. The proposed system is based on advanced perception techniques, vehicle automation and communications between vehicles (V2V) and with the infrastructure (V2I). Sensor fusion architecture based on computer vision and laser scanner technologies are developed. It allows real time detection and classification of obstacles, and the identification of potential risks. The driver receives this information and some warnings generated by the system. In case, he does not react in a proper way, the vehicle could perform autonomous actions (both on speed control or steering maneuvers) to improve safety and/or efficiency. Furthermore, a multimodal V2V and V2I communication system, based on GeoNetworking, facilitates the flow of information between vehicles and assists in the detection and information broadcasting processes. All this, combined with vehicle positioning, detailed digital maps and advanced map-matching algorithms, establish the decision algorithms of different ADAS systems.

Practical realization of DSS simulation on the base of Petri Net model is proposed. Transport system as complex and safety-critical is one of the main application of various DSS.

On the other hand, determining how performance and reliability/availability of these systems vary as a function of configuration parameters, such as the amount of cache servers to be deployed, and the degree of in-memory replication of slices of data, is far from being a trivial task. Yet, it is an essential aspect of the provisioning process of cloud platforms, given that it has an impact on the amount of cloud resources that are planned for usage. To cope with the issue of predicting/analysing the behavior of different configurations of cloud in-memory data stores, in this article we present a flexible simulation framework offering skeleton simulation models that can be easily specialized in order to capture the dynamics of diverse data grid systems, such as those related to the specific (distributed) protocol used to provide data consistency and/or transactional guarantees. Besides its flexibility, another peculiar aspect of the framework lies in that it integrates simulation and machine-learning (black-box) techniques, the latter being used to capture the dynamics of the data-exchange layer (e.g. the message passing layer) across the cache servers. This is a relevant aspect when considering that the actual data-transport/networking infrastructure on top of which the data grid is deployed might be unknown, hence being not feasible to be modeled via white-box (namely purely simulative) approaches. We also provide an extended experimental study aimed at validating instances of simulation models supported by our framework against execution dynamics of real data grid systems deployed on top of either private or public cloud infrastructures. Particularly, our validation test-bed has been based on an industrial-grade open-source data grid, namely Infinispan by JBoss/Red-Hat, and a de-facto standard benchmark for NoSQL platforms, namely YCSB by Yahoo. The validation study has been conducted by relying on both public and private cloud systems, scaling the underlying infrastructure up to 100 (resp. 140) Virtual Machines for the public (resp. private) cloud case.

This, in turn, improves the transient performance of the control system. A multi-layer neural network and adaptive robust control techniques are also employed to preserve the controller robustness against unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov stability analysis shows that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded.

The desired and preferred capability depends on timely and quantitative knowledge of water quality monitoring in terms of total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations. This paper presents the development of a suite of nowcasting and forecasting methods by using high-resolution remote-sensing-based monitoring techniques on a daily basis. First, the integrated data fusion and mining (IDFM) technique was applied to develop a near real-time monitoring system for daily nowcasting of the TSS concentrations. Then a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARXNET) model was selected and applied for forecasting analysis of the changes in TSS concentrations over time on a rolling basis onward using the IDFM technique. The implementation of such an integrated forecasting and nowcasting approach was assessed by a case study at Lake Mead hosting the water intake for Las Vegas, Nevada, in the water-stressed western U.S. Long-term monthly averaged results showed no simultaneous impact from forest fire events on accelerating the rise of TSS concentration. However, the results showed a probable impact of a decade of drought on increasing TSS concentration in the Colorado River Arm and Overton Arm. Results of the forecasting model highlight the reservoir water level as a significant parameter in predicting TSS in Lake Mead. In addition, the R-squared value of 0.98 and the root mean square error of 0.5 between the observed and predicted TSS values demonstrates the reliability and application potential of this remote sensing-based early warning system in terms of TSS projections at a drinking water intake.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They allow old and frail people a self-determined living in their familiar environment. Due to the current demographic and social developments further increases in demand for HHC must be expected. Additionally, people with limited mobility or relying on medical supply usually need consistent care. Thus, HHC service providers will be faced with two challenges: an increased organizational effort due to the rising demand and the need for an anticipatory risk management. Previous research combining optimization and risk management in the field of HHC limits itself to rural regions, where nurses are solely using cars. The presented work specifically aims to deal with the peculiarities of urban regions. Together with the Austrian Red Cross (ARC), a vulnerability analysis has been conducted in order to identify the critical success factors and processes of HHC as well as potential threats. To support the daily scheduling, a Tabu Search (TS) based metaheuristic has been implemented. As nurses can choose between different transport modes (public transport, car, bike, and walking), time-dependent multimodal transport has been considered. The TS has been tested with real-world data from the ARC in Vienna to support both, daily business and scheduling in times of disasters. Significant reductions of travel and waiting times can be obtained, such that more time remains for serving the clients.

When infested by the RPW, all untreated palms typically die. RPW monitoring is difficult, and when the pest is detected, management to save the infested palm becomes intricate. For this reason, an efficient and integrated RPW monitoring, such as a location-aware system (LAS), combined with the scientific knowledge of experts on the palm’s physiology and the RPW biological cycle must be designed, developed and implemented. In the current study, an innovative integrated RPW management in urban landscapes under real conditions is presented. Based on the LAS, this study investigates the effectiveness of monitoring RPW infestations in palms, such as the Phoenix canariensis, under field conditions at the Pedion Areos park, which is located in central Athens, the capital of the Hellenic Republic. The goal of this study is to address the specific needs of RPW management and control by facilitating the treatment process adopted by experts combined with an appropriate spatial decision support system (SDSS), which accounts for the RPW population dynamics and spatio-temporal characteristics of the infested areas. The process of estimating the infestation risk is based on a ten-point scale classification, which is incorporated into the LAS. The results from the aforementioned moderate-scaled field experiment conducted for evaluation purposes showed that the LAS is an innovative, simple, and easy to use integrated platform that can be used for early detection, rapid monitoring and assessment of RPW in urban landscapes. Finally, the results from this four-year experiment showed that the diameter and height of the trunk of canary palms play a significant role in the susceptibility to RPW infestations and the recovery of infested canary palms; the results also demonstrated that control of RPW in urban landscapes is possible.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

                  Explore whether agent-based modeling and simulation can help healthcare administrators discover interventions that increase population wellness and quality of care while, simultaneously, decreasing costs.

                  Methods
                  The study explores the utility of translating an existing (prize winning) software for modeling complex societal systems and agent's daily life activities (like a Sim City style of software), into a desired decision support system. A case study tests if the 3 levels of system modeling approach is feasible, valid, and useful.

                  Results
                  Section 3 explains the models using data from the case study and thereby establishes feasibility of the approach for modeling a real system. The models were trained and tuned using national epidemiologic datasets and various domain expert inputs. To avoid co-mingling of training and testing data, the simulations were then run and compared (Section 4.1) to an analysis of 250,000 Philadelphia patient hospital admissions for the year 2010 in terms of re-hospitalization rate, number of doctor visits, and days in hospital. Based on the Student t-test, deviations between simulated vs. real world outcomes are not statistically significant. Validity is thus established for the 2008–2010 timeframe. We computed models of various types of interventions that were ineffective as well as 4 categories of interventions (e.g., reduced per-nurse caseload, increased check-ins and stays, etc.) that result in improvement in well-being and cost.

Moreover, the inclusion of the great spatial heterogeneity characteristic of urban environments seems to be essential in order to achieve an accurate environmental-noise prediction in cities. This problem is addressed in this paper, where a procedure based on feature-selection techniques and machine-learning regression methods is proposed and applied to this environmental problem. Three machine-learning regression methods, which are considered very robust in solving non-linear problems, are used to estimate the energy-equivalent sound-pressure level descriptor (LAeq). These three methods are: (i) multilayer perceptron (MLP), (ii) sequential minimal optimisation (SMO), and (iii) Gaussian processes for regression (GPR). In addition, because of the high number of input variables involved in environmental-noise modelling and estimation in urban environments, which make LAeq prediction models quite complex and costly in terms of time and resources for application to real situations, three different techniques are used to approach feature selection or data reduction. The feature-selection techniques used are: (i) correlation-based feature-subset selection (CFS), (ii) wrapper for feature-subset selection (WFS), and the data reduction technique is principal-component analysis (PCA). The subsequent analysis leads to a proposal of different schemes, depending on the needs regarding data collection and accuracy. The use of WFS as the feature-selection technique with the implementation of SMO or GPR as regression algorithm provides the best LAeq estimation (R2

Despite all the progress, we cannot ignore the fact that the conditions provided by the society for the deaf are still far from being perfect. The communication with deaf by means of written text is not as efficient as it might seem at first. In fact, there is a very deep gap between sign language and spoken/written language. The vocabulary, the sentence construction and the grammatical rules are quite different among these two worlds. These facts bring significant difficulties in reading and understanding the meaning of text for deaf people and, on the other hand, make it quite difficult for people with no hearing disabilities to understand sign language. The deployment of tools to assist the daily communication, in schools, in public services, in museums and other, between deaf people and the rest may be a significant contribution to the social inclusion of the deaf community. The work described in this paper addresses the development of a bidirectional translator between Portuguese Sign Language and Portuguese text. The translator from sign language to text resorts to two devices, namely the Microsoft Kinect and 5DT Sensor Gloves in order to gather data about the motion and shape of the hands. The hands configurations are classified using Support Vector Machines. The classification of the movement and orientation of the hands are achieved through the use of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.

Moreover, the procedure for identifying MSW disposal sites is accomplished by performing four computational models for synthesizing the DMs per criterion preferential system. Based on the case study results, a comparison analysis is performed according to suitability index estimations. According to them Euclidean distance metric and TOPSIS present strong similarities.

The field trials provided vital information on driver behaviour in the presence of ISA. The purpose of this paper is to exploit the information gathered in the field trials to predict the impacts of various forms of ISA and to assess whether ISA is viable in terms of benefit-to-cost ratio. ISA is predicted to save up to 33% of accidents on urban roads, and to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 5.8% on 70mph roads. In order to investigate the long-term impacts of ISA, two hypothetical deployment scenarios were envisaged covering a 60-year appraisal period. The results indicate that ISA could deliver a very healthy benefit-to-cost ratio, ranging from 3.4 to 7.4, depending on the deployment scenarios. Under both deployment scenarios, ISA has recovered its implementation costs in less than 15 years. It can be concluded that implementation of ISA is clearly justified from a social cost and benefit perspective. Of the two deployment scenarios, the Market Driven one is substantially outperformed by the Authority Driven one. The benefits of ISA on fuel saving and emission reduction are real but not substantial, in comparison with the benefits on accident reduction; up to 98% of benefits are attributable to accident savings.

Modern logistic problems, for example, call for expanding the problem both vertically (from one day up to several days) and horizontally (combining separate solution stages into an integrated model). The complexity of such integrated models calls for alternative methods of solution, such as Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), which provide a further increase in the performance necessary for the daily operation.

This paper deals with the model development, optimal design and feedback control of an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) reactor for NOx removal. A 3D dynamic simulation model for use to investigate the reaction behavior and the transport phenomena in the catalytic filter of the SCR reactor is proposed. To estimate the model's kinetic parameters from experimental data, an optimization technique that integrates Taguchi method, a real-coded genetic algorithm and a neural network auxiliary model is developed. With the proposed dynamic model, we investigated the effects of the key parameters, such as the gas hourly space velocity, operating temperature and the amount of ammonium used, on the NOx conversion and NH3 slip phenomena. To improve the NOx abatement performance, the proposed optimization technique is then applied to search for a set of best operation conditions for the SCR reactor. The obtained results indicate that the optimized SCR can achieve the NOx reduction rate up to 99.93%, which is over 9% better in performance than the previously reported one in the literature. Besides, the optimal operating temperature is considerably lower and the emission of ammonium from the reactor is insignificant. Compared with conventional designs, the proposed design is much better in energy savings and is environment-friendly. To attenuate the negative effects of environmental disturbances on reactor's performance, we implemented a direct adaptive control strategy to the SCR reactor. The stability of the control system is theoretically guaranteed with a Lyapunov-based approach.

The proposed method builds fuzzy additive value functions taking as input a partial preorder on a subset of the options, called reference set, along with their associated scores on the criteria. The resulting fuzzy utility functions can subsequently be used to estimate the (fuzzy) utility of each option, thus allowing their ranking, prioritization, selection or classification. The ranking of the options in partial preorder is as compatible as possible to the original one.

                  The project was developed in two stages:
                  The first was the creation of several three-dimensional (3D) models, each representing a different theory or hypothesis. The models were based on accurate Computer Assisted Design (CAD) (Autodesk® AutoCAD) models for the reconstruction of the buildings, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (ESRI®
                     ) for the recreation of the terrain, thereby creating a realistic representation of what exists now, and a close approximation to what may have once existed.
                  In the second stage, a simplified version of the models was imported into a Virtual Reality (VR) game engine (Bethesda Softworks®
                     ) to create the ambience of the villa at the time, allowing full exploration of the space. It also includes fauna and flora, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven avatars, as can be seen in the Video 1 provided in the electronic version of this manuscript.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

                  Stage one of the CO2CRC Otway Project (the Project) has successfully injected over 65,000 tonnes of CO2-rich gas (80% carbon dioxide; 20% methane) into a depleted natural gas reservoir. An exhaustive data set of pre- and post-injection monitoring information has been collected across the atmospheric, near-surface and sub-surface domains. These monitoring results have been largely consistent with the modelling predictions thereby adding confidence to both the approach and validity of the sub-surface realisations. Public confidence has benefited from this and allowed the CO2CRC to look at exploiting new opportunities at the Otway Project site that serve to optimise the existing infrastructure.
                  Otway Stage two is based on injection into a heterogeneous formation with no apparent structural closure with the principal objective of understanding trapping mechanisms in deep saline formations. A research program has been developed adapting the “Huff and Puff” technique to better understand the key parameters impacting residual trapping.
                  The key challenges faced by the Project have been both technical and legislative. These have included getting the original project approved in the absence of legislation dedicated to carbon storage and managing the transition of these multi-jurisdictional legislative approvals to the new carbon storage legislation passed by the Victorian State Government in 2008.
                  The Otway Project has provided the Victorian Government with a valuable practical case study from which to draw learnings for developing policy and regulatory frameworks for carbon capture and storage (CCS). As the Victorian Government brought Australia’s first standalone carbon storage legislation (based on petroleum legislation) into operation in December 2009, some unique insights have been identified through the Otway Project. These include an understanding of stakeholder perception through the Project’s community engagement activities and more recently, on how an existing research and demonstration project could be bridged to a newly introduced legislative regime. Other jurisdictions with CCS projects are likely to find these projectbased learnings of great value, particularly, in developing regulatory frameworks and a risk communication strategy.
                  The Otway Project is currently Australia’s only active storage project and in addition to performing important storage research, is a key driver for enhancing community confidence towards CCS. These are all critical considerations for accelerating commercial deployment of CCS and the Project is playing an important part in turning research into reality.
                  We summarise Stage one of the project, capture the knowledge gained and describe the approach taken in Stage two to utilise the sub-surface and infrastructure available to address key research questions while continuing to build public confidence for CCS as a mitigation mechanism.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Using the modified SVMr, we study different influences which may modify the ozone prediction, such as previous ozone measurements in a given station, measurements in neighbors stations, and the influence of meteorologic variables. We use statistical tests to verify the significance of incorporating different variables into the SVMr. A comparison with the results obtained using a neural network (multi-layer perceptron) is also carried out. This study has been carried out in 5 different stations of the air pollution monitoring network of Madrid, so the conclusions raised are backed by real data. The final result of the work is a robust and powerful software for tropospheric ozone prediction in Madrid.

AGs have extensively been utilized in applications such as artificial intelligence, structural pattern recognition, compiler construction and even text editing. Obviously, the performance of an attribute evaluation system resides in the efficiency of the syntactic and semantic subsystems. In this paper, a hardware architecture for an attribute evaluation system is presented, which is based on an efficient combinatorial implementation of Earley's parallel parsing algorithm for the syntax part of the attribute grammar. The semantic part is managed by a special purpose module that traverses the parse tree and evaluates the attributes based on a proposed stack-based approach. The entire system is described in Verilog HDL (hardware design language), in a template form that given the specification of an arbitrary attribute grammar, the HDL synthesizable source code of the system is produced on the fly by a proposed automated tool. The generated code has been simulated for validation, synthesized and tested on an Xilinx FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) board for various AGs. Our method increases the performance up to three orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches, depending on the implementation, the size of the grammar and the input string length. This makes it particularly appealing for applications where attribute evaluation is a crucial aspect, like in real-time and embedded systems.

These characteristics render measurement and management of the production capacity difficult. The motivation for this study is a real life problem faced at Trakya Cam in Turkey. Trakya Cam has multiple geographically separated production facilities. Since transportation of glass is expensive, logistics costs are high.

Two solutions for production planning are proposed: a knowledge-based algorithm using production rules, and an OO resolved scheduling rate planner (RSRP) based on variable-timing simulation.

In problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. However, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. The present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. The method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. Each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. While the initial control area is radial, its shape is adaptively improved using a Hermite interpolation procedure. The modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. As optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. The modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the Greek island of Santorini. The numerical code SEAWAT was selected for solving the partial differential equations of flow and density dependent transport. The decision variables correspond to pumping rates from 34 wells.

In particular, we have developed an IEEE FIPA compliant mobile agent system called Mobile-C and designed an agent-based real-time traffic detection and management system (ABRTTDMS). The system based on Mobile-C takes advantages of both stationary agents and mobile agents. The use of mobile agents allows ABRTTDMS dynamically deploying new control algorithms and operations to respond unforeseen events and conditions.

Accurate prediction of short-term traffic flow under atypical conditions, such as vehicular crashes, inclement weather, work zone, and holidays, is crucial to effective and proactive traffic management systems in the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and, more specifically, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA).
                  To this end, this paper presents an application of a supervised statistical learning technique called Online Support Vector machine for Regression, or OL-SVR, for the prediction of short-term freeway traffic flow under both typical and atypical conditions. The OL-SVR model is compared with three well-known prediction models including Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML), Holt exponential smoothing, and artificial neural net models.
                  The resultant performance comparisons suggest that GML, which relies heavily on the recurring characteristics of day-to-day traffic, performs slightly better than other models under typical traffic conditions, as demonstrated by previous studies. Yet OL-SVR is the best performer under non-recurring atypical traffic conditions.

                  Neural networks can risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with potential acute coronary syndromes with a high specificity, potentially facilitating ED discharge of patients to home. We hypothesized that the use of “real-time” neural networks would decrease the admission rate for ED chest pain patients.
               
                  Methods
                  We conducted a before-and-after trial. Consecutive ED patients with chest pain were evaluated before and after implementation of a neural network in an urban university ED. Data included 40 variables used in neural networks for acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Data were obtained in real time, and neural network outputs were provided to the treating physician while patients were in the ED. On hospital discharge, attending physicians received feedback, including neural network output, their initial clinical impression, cardiac test results, and final diagnosis. The main outcome was the actual admit/discharge decision made before versus after the implementation of the neural network.
               
                  Results
                  Before implementation, 4,492 patients were enrolled; after implementation, 432 patients were enrolled. Implementation of the neural network did not decrease the hospital admission rate (before: 62.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 61.3% to 64.1%] versus after: 66.6% [95% CI 62.2% to 71.0%]). Additionally, the ICU admission rates were not different (11.4% [95% CI 10.5% to 12.3%] versus 9.3% [95% CI 6.6% to 12.0%]). Physician query found that the neural network changed management in only 2 cases (<1%).
               
                  Conclusion
                  The use of real-time neural network feedback did not influence the admission decision for ED patients with chest pain, most likely because the neural network output was delayed until the return of cardiac markers, and the disposition decision had already been made by that time.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The results of the inter-comparison are the fruits of collaboration between some of the partners of the APPETISE project funded under the Framework V Information Societies and Technologies (IST) programme. Two different cases for study were selected: the Siracusa industrial area, in Italy, where the pollution is dominated by industrial emissions and the Belfast urban area, in the UK, where domestic heating makes an important contribution. The different kinds of pollution (industrial/urban) and different locations of the areas considered make the results more general and interesting. In order to make the inter-comparison more objective, all the modellers considered the same datasets. Missing data in the original time series was filled by using appropriate techniques. The inter-comparison work was carried out on a rigorous basis according to the performance indices recommended by the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC). The targets for the implemented prediction models were defined according to the EC normative relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide. According to this normative, three different kinds of targets were considered namely daily mean values, daily maximum values and hourly mean values. The inter-compared models were tested on real cases of poor air quality. In the paper, the inter-compared techniques are ranked in terms of their capability to predict critical episodes. A ranking in terms of their predictability of the three different targets considered is also proposed. Several key issues are illustrated and discussed such as the role of input variable selection, the use of meteorological data, and the use of interpolated time series. Moreover, a novel approach referred to as the technique of balancing the training pattern set, which was successfully applied to improve the capability of ANN models to predict exceedences is introduced. The results show that there is no single modelling approach, which generates optimum results in terms of the full range of performance indices considered. In view of the implementation of a warning system for air quality control, approaches that are able to work better in the prediction of critical episodes must be preferred. Therefore, the artificial neural network prediction models can be recommended for this purpose. The best forecasts were achieved for daily averages of SO2 while daily maximum and hourly mean values are difficult to predict with acceptable accuracy.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An ATIS consists of a route guiding system that recommends the most suitable route based on the traveler's requirements using the information gathered from various sources such as loop detectors and probe vehicles. This information can be disseminated through mass media or on on-board satellite-based navigational system. Based on the estimated travel times for various routes, the traveler can make a route choice. In this article, a neural network model is presented for forecasting the freeway link travel time using the counter propagation neural (CPN) network. The performance of the model is compared with a recently reported freeway link travel forecasting model using the backpropagation (BP) neural network algorithm. It is shown that the new model based on the CPN network, and the learning coefficients proposed by Adeli and Park, is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the BP network. As such, the proposed freeway link travel-forecasting model is particularly suitable for real-time advanced travel information and management systems.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In addition, most incident detection algorithms do not have an optimal property in terms of detection delay with respect to false alarm rate. In the study presented in this paper, the incident detection problem was formulated as an optimization problem. To implement the algorithm, called the CUSUM algorithm that was derived from the optimization formulation of the incident detection problem, a simplified procedure was developed. Based on this procedure, three varieties of the CUSUM algorithm were developed and tested based on real incident data against a newly defined criterion for mean detection delay. Selected incident detection algorithms were also compared with the CUSUM algorithms. The comparison demonstrates the superiority of the CUSUM algorithms against other selected algorithms in reducing detection delay while maintaining an acceptable detection rate.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Examples include mobile robots in a warehouse, taxis in an urban road network, or aeroplanes for medical evacuation. In contrast with the Vehicle Routing Problem, for which a plethora of techniques is available, few approaches exist that permit the efficient deployment of a large number of vehicles in a changing environment. This paper highlights the characteristic features of the problem, reviews possible approaches and existing techniques, and proposes a heuristic solution to the DTPP using a Blackboard-based approach. The resulting application is an intelligent transportation planning system (ITPS) for a fleet of automated robot taxis, based on the generic assumption-based truth maintained Blackboard shell (GATMBS) and comprising traffic simulation models as well as various monitoring and problem-solving strategies for assignment and routing. The Blackboard architecture supports the dynamic alteration of planned routes in response to changes in traffic conditions and passenger requests.

Many real-world problems are resource-allocation problems, such as production planning and manpower planning. This paper reports on a case study on applying constraint-satisfaction techniques to solve a real-world resource allocation problem, referred to as the Railway Track Possession Assignment Problem, using the CHIP constraint language. The problem is to assign railway tracks to a given set of scheduled maintenance tasks according to a set of constraints. The manual problem-solving method is heuristic in nature. Experienced personnel were involved in the manual process. An expert system, called the Engineering Work Track Possession Assignment System (EWTPAS), was developed to carry out the assignment using constraint-satisfaction techniques. A new, two-phase resource allocation strategy based on constraint relaxation was developed and implemented in EWTPAS. EWTPAS succeeded in replacing the manual assignment process after test running for 1 year. EWTPAS is now in use. Besides having the advantage of being free of careless human errors, and the advantage of being independent of the availability of experienced staff, EWTPAS was found to be about 10 times more efficient than the manual method.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The objective of the vehicle location system is to keep track of the vehicle location for a human driver, and perhaps to provide the driver with real-time audio directions to his destination. The techniques developed here are equally applicable to autonomous robot navigation. The prototype system uses odometer readings and a skeleton map to perform dead reckoning, and uses low-bandwidth visual information and neural networks to recognize places for correcting cumulative dead reckoning errors. The visual information is also used to detect turns, for dead reckoning at intersections. The system is self-contained in the sense that it requires no infrastructure outside the vehicle, such as external beacons installed on roadways or satellites used by Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The system maintains a large number of location hypotheses and searches for a large number of landmarks stored in a database in real time. Hence the system is robustly able to recover the vehicle location after being lost for various reasons. The system has been tested, with success, in both day and night time, in all four seasons, and on roads in New York City, a regional highway, and on suburban streets.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The framework has been implemented as the intelligent forecasters construction set (IFCS), which supports the intelligent techniques of fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, and knowledge-based and case-based reasoning. IFCS is also a hybrid programming tool, which allows the developer to implement forecasters by means of object-oriented visual programming, knowledge-based programming and procedural programming. The system was implemented on the real-time expert-system shell G2, with the G2 Diagnostic Assistant (GDA) and NeurOn-Line (NOL) modules. Rules, procedures and flow diagrams are organized into a hierarchy of workspaces. The modularity of IFCS allows the subsequent addition of other modules of intelligent techniques.

Although systems exist which can detect the presence of a vehicle and its speed under certain conditions, there is generally a lack of effective means to measure both the speed and direction of traffic movement. This is particularly true for road junctions, where conflicting traffic shares the same space and where some control strategy could be more effectively applied with the help of speed and direction estimates. The increasing use of closed circuit television (CCTV) systems has provided the opportunity to apply image processing techniques to extract such information. However, such techniques are computationally intensive in general, and the application of parallel processing methods is one of the best choices which could bring the desired acquisition of movement information into practical reality. This paper describes a parallel video-based image analysis system which is capable of extracting movement information, including direction and speed, of road vehicular traffic over any part of a road surface. The prototype has been implemented on an array of 36 transputers and an image grabber with a SUN SPARC IPC as the host machine. The software mainly consists of median filtering, feature extraction, spatio-temporal analysis, matching of image features in successive images by neural networks and aggregation of matched results. This algorithm has been tested using data for a signal-controlled junction aiming to capture an opposed turning traffic movement with promising results. It has also been shown that a real-time system based on the described algorithm is feasible.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The training set needed to generate the NNM is obtained from a two-phase cell model of the fluidized-bed where the flow patterns for the bubble and emulsion phases in each cell are assumed to be plug-flow and perfectly mixed, respectively. The intrinsic kinetics, which are taken from the literature, are based upon a single site redox type model that exhibits a nonlinear dependence on both molecular oxygen and propylene. The formation of acrolein, acetaldehyde, and total combustion products is described by a series-parallel reaction network. The fluidized bed model accounts for variable gas velocity as well as finite transport resistance between the bubble ane emulsion phases. To perform the required NNM training, output responses predicted from the cell model are first generated by using all possible combinations of eleven key input parameters varied over practical ranges of interest. The axial variation of the nine output responses is represented by a recurrent NNM. The NNM parameters are then identified using a special-purpose computer software package that implements both training and analysis of the input data and corresponding output responses. To simulate the behavior of a real reactor, the output responses are corrupted with random noise. Comparisons between the output responses obtained from the NNM trained to noisy data to those from the cell model with no noise indicate that the NNM is capable of providing filtering. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis indicates that the NNM captures the dependence of the output variables on the input ones.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used to outline a proposal for the next generation of multi-agent systems.",smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
