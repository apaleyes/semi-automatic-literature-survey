Although of low complexity the resulting network achieves a high level of accuracy in iris region segmentation for challenging off-axis eye-patches. Interestingly, this network is also shown to achieve high levels of performance for regular, frontal, segmentation of iris regions, comparing favourably with state-of-the-art techniques of significantly higher complexity. Due to its lower complexity this network is well suited for deployment in embedded applications such as augmented and mixed reality headsets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

350944360,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"This study describes the development of a simple and easy-to-build portable automated bag valve mask (BVM) compression system, which, during acute shortages and supply chain disruptions can serve as a temporary emergency ventilator. The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.Peer reviewe","[{'title': 'HardwareX', 'identifiers': ['issn:2468-0672', '2468-0672']}]",'Elsevier BV',Partially RepRapable automated open source bag valve mask-based ventilator,10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00131,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237183624,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Parking vehicle is a daunting task and a common problem in many cities around the globe. The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection. The detected results were compared with a template of parking spaces and IoU value is used to identify vehicle occupancy information",,'Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)',Deep learning-based vehicle occupancy detection in an open parking lot using thermal camera,10.1049/iet-its.2019.0468,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322738580,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An important research problem in artificial intelligence is how to organize multiple agents, and coordinate them, so that they can work together to solve problems. Coordinating agents in a multi-agent system can significantly affect the systems performance-the agents can, in many instances, be organized so that they can solve tasks more efficiently, and consequently benefit collectively and individually. Central to this endeavor is coalition formation-the process by which heterogeneous agents organize and form disjoint groups (coalitions). Coalition formation often involves finding a coalition structure (an exhaustive set of disjoint coalitions) that maximizes the systems potential performance (e.g., social welfare) through coalition structure generation. However, coalition structure generation typically has no notion of goals. In cooperative settings, where coordination of multiple coalitions is important, this may generate suboptimal teams for achieving and accomplishing the tasks and goals at hand. With this in mind, we consider simultaneously generating coalitions of agents and assigning the coalitions to independent alternatives (e.g., tasks/goals), and present an anytime algorithm for the simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment problem. This combinatorial optimization problem hasmany real-world applications, including forming goal-oriented teams. To evaluate the presented algorithms performance, we present five methods for synthetic problem set generation, and benchmark the algorithm against the industry-grade solver CPLEXusing randomized data sets of varying distribution and complexity. To test its anytime-performance, we compare the quality of its interim solutions against those generated by a greedy algorithm and pure random search. Finally, we also apply the algorithm to solve the problem of assigning agents to regions in a major commercial strategy game, and show that it can be used in game-playing to coordinate smaller sets of agents in real-time.Funding Agencies|Linkoping University; Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An anytime algorithm for optimal simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment,10.1007/s10458-020-09450-1,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new domain that the methods of its data analysis could provide the researchers with new insights for their research studies and more innovative ways to analyze their data or verify the data with this method. Also, a very significant element in teaching is teacher motivation that is the trigger that pushes the teachers forward, depending on some internal and external factors. In the current study, seven research questions were designed to explore different aspects of teacher motivation, and they were analyzed via SPSS. The current study also compared the results by using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Due to the similarity of ANFIS to humans' brain intelligence, the results of the current study could be similar to humans regarding what happens in reality. To do so, the researchers used the validated teacher motivation scale (TMS) and asked participants to fill the questionnaire, and analyzed the results. When the inputs were added to the ANFIS system, the model indicated a high accuracy and prediction capability. The findings also illustrated the importance of the tuning model parameters for the ANFIS method to build up the AI model with a high repeatability level.

482629844,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"Illegal logging and trafficking of endangered timber species has attracted the world's major organized crime groups, with associated deforestation and serious social damage. The inability of traditional methodologies and DNA analysis to readily perform wood identification to the species level for monitoring has stimulated research on chemotyping techniques. In this study, simple wood extraction of endangered rosewoods (Dalbergia spp), amenable to use in the field, produced colorful hues that were suggestive of wood species. A more definitive study was conducted to develop wood species identification procedures using high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometers interfaced with liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART). The time consuming process of extracting “identifying” mass spectral ions for species identification, contentious due to their ubiquitous nature, was supplanted by application of machine learning processes. The unbiased software mining of raw data from multiple analytical batches, followed by statistical Random Forest analysis, enabled discrimination between both anatomically and chemotypically similar Dalbergia species. Statistical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scatterplots with 95% confidence ellipses were visually compelling in showing a differential clustering of Dalbergia from other commonly traded and lookalike wood species.

389904876,2020-07-09T00:00:00,"The article presents a new concept of “Management of knowledge about virtual promotion” on the Internet. Usually a real produ ct or service is being divided into four components (product, price, promotion and place) in accordance with the theory of marketing. One of the components is a product promotion. But now this element is becoming a fully virtual tool. It is necessary to consider product promotion as an image or a copy of a real product in a virtual space that lives in parallel on the network. Therefore, the objective of the paper is the presentation of a new object of research based on the experience of more than thirty real projects performed in Ukraine, USA, Europe and Canada. We regard the promotion as a software product, which works according to principles of knowledge management and machine learning. It is proposed that virtual promotion is characterized by four views: customer or user, data, technology and marketing. Thus, the structure of virtual promotion business process was presented. It includes four steps: selection of hypertext sources, knowledge representation and extraction, semantic kernel building and quality criterion evaluation to stop the process. Based on the process structure the research tasks were identified. The central task is semantic kernel forming. Then the software architecture was developed. IT solution contains CRM system as accounting tool and Web site as an image of virtual promotion. CRM plays main role as a commander center. Here we form semantic kernel and then send it via marketing channels such as Web site, telegram or viber accounts. Another part of IT solution is Web service such as Bing API or Google API. They help us to build the kernel. Also the paper demonstrates the list of future tasks that should be solved and the example of real project of proposed approach.В статье представлена новая технология «управление знаниями о виртуальном продвижении» в среде Интернет.

333569035,2020,"Integrated clinical pathways (ICPs) are task-oriented care plans detailing the essential steps of the therapeutic pathway referring to a specific clinical problem with a patient’s expected clinical course. ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient’s health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based approaches",,'MDPI AG',Design and Execution of Integrated Clinical Pathway: A Simplified Meta-Model and Associated Methodology,10.3390/info11070362,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This special issue contains four papers dealing with architectures and design methodologies to support embedded intelligence, but also providing best practices and software support.



The paper “A Technologically Agnostic Framework for Cyber-Physical and IoT Processing-in-Memory-based Systems Simulation”, by Santos et al., aims to focus on Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a solution for efficiently processing big data. In particular, this work presents a framework to simulate and automatically generate code for IoT PIM-based systems. Moreover, it proposes an high speed and energy efficient architecture for an IoT PIM system, able to compute a real image recognition application.



The paper “Recommender system implementations for embedded collaborative filtering applications”, by Pajuelo-Holguera et al., aims to propose a complete recommender system implemented on reconfigurable hardware with the purpose of testing on-chip, low-energy embedded collaborative filtering applications. The proposed approach solves any prediction problem based on collaborative filtering by using an off-line, highly-portable light computing environment. Moreover, this work exploits a custom, fine-grained parallel circuit for quick matrix multiplication with floating-point numbers.



The paper “SystemC-based Electronic System-Level Design Space Exploration Environment for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems”, by Pomante et al., faces the problem of the Electronic System-Level (ESL) HW/SW co-design of dedicated electronic digital systems based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures. In particular, the work presents a prototype SystemC -based environment that exploits a Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach able to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the system specification and a mapping onto an automatically defined architecture.



The paper “A Fast and Scalable Architecture to Run Convolutional Neural Networks in Low Density FPGAs”, by Véstias et al., deals with efficient configurable architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) inference targeting any density FPGAs. The architecture exploits fixed-point arithmetic and image batch to reduce computational, memory and memory bandwidth requirements without compromising network accuracy.



In conclusion, this special issue offers some timely contributions to advance the research of intelligent embedded systems by analyzing both architectures and applications. All of four papers are worth reading and will inspire more interesting ideas and research topics.

288570501,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Performing multi-objective optimization under uncertainty is a common requirement in industries and academia. Robust optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has access to behavioral data for the uncertain parameters. However, solutions of RO may be far from the real solution and less reliable due to inability to map the uncertain space accurately, especially when the data appears discontinuous and scattered in the uncertain domain. Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study. Considered case-studies include highly nonlinear model for continuous casting process from steelmaking industries, where a multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is solved to balance the conflict between productivity and energy consumption. The Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting RO problem are obtained through Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm – II, and ~23–29% improvement is observed in the uncertain objective function. Further, the spread and diversity metrics are enhanced by ~10–95% as compared to those obtained using other standard uncertainty sets",,'Elsevier BV',Towards Efficient Robust Optimization using Data based Optimal Segmentation of Uncertain Space,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106821,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents an intelligent system capable of deciding which countermeasures to take in order to mitigate an intrusion in a software defined network. The interaction between the intruder and the defender is posed as a Markov game and MuZero algorithm is used to train the model through self-play. Once trained, the model is integrated with an SDN controller, so that it is able to apply the countermeasures of the game in a real network. To measure the performance of the model, attackers and defenders with different training steps have been confronted and the scores obtained by each of them, the duration of the games and the ratio of games won have been collected.

491003696,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Since 2017, we have used IonTorrent NGS platform in our hospital to diagnose and treat cancer. Analyzing variants at each run requires considerable time, and we are still struggling with some variants that appear correct on the metrics at first, but are found to be negative upon further investigation. Can any machine learning algorithm (ML) help us classify NGS variants? This has led us to investigate which ML can fit our NGS data and to develop a tool that can be routinely implemented to help biologists. Currently, one of the greatest challenges in medicine is processing a significant quantity of data. This is particularly true in molecular biology with the advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for profiling and identifying molecular tumors and their treatment. In addition to bioinformatics pipelines, artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable in helping to analyze mutation variants. Generating sequencing data from patient DNA samples has become easy to perform in clinical trials. However, analyzing the massive quantities of genomic or transcriptomic data and extracting the key biomarkers associated with a clinical response to a specific therapy requires a formidable combination of scientific expertise, biomolecular skills and a panel of bioinformatic and biostatistic tools, in which artificial intelligence is now successful in developing future routine diagnostics. However, cancer genome complexity and technical artifacts make identifying real variants challenging. We present a machine learning method for classifying pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs), insertions, and deletions detected by NGS from different types of tumor specimens, such as: colorectal, melanoma, lung and glioma cancer. We compared our NGS data to different machine learning algorithms using the k-fold cross-validation method and to neural networks (deep learning) to measure the performance of the different ML algorithms and determine which one is a valid model for confirming NGS variant calls in cancer diagnosis. We trained our machine learning with 70% of our data samples, extracted from our local database (our data structure had 7 parameters: chromosome, position, exon, variant allele frequency, minor allele frequency, coverage and protein description) and validated it with the 30% remaining data. The model offering the best accuracy was chosen and implemented in the NGS analysis routine. Artificial intelligence was developed with the R script language version 3.6.0. We trained our model on 70% of 102,011 variants. Our best error rate (0.22%) was found with random forest machine learning (ntree = 500 and mtry = 4), with an AUC of 0.99. Neural networks achieved some good scores. The final trained model with the neural network achieved an accuracy of 98% and an ROC-AUC of 0.99 with validation data. We tested our RF model to interpret more than 2000 variants from our NGS database: 20 variants were misclassified (error rate < 1%). The errors were nomenclature problems and false positives. After adding false positives to our training database and implementing our RF model routinely, our error rate was always < 0.5%. The RF model shows excellent results for oncosomatic NGS interpretation and can easily be implemented in other molecular biology laboratories. AI is becoming increasingly important in molecular biomedical analysis and can be very helpful in processing medical data. Neural networks show a good capacity in variant classification, and in the future, they may be useful in predicting more complex variants","[{'title': 'Scientific Reports', 'identifiers': ['2045-2322', 'issn:2045-2322']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Machine learning random forest for predicting oncosomatic variant NGS analysis,10.1038/s41598-021-01253-y,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480201885,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The increasing digitalization and advancement in information communication technologies has greatly changed how humans interact with digital information. Nowadays, it is not sufficient to only display relevant data in production activities, as the enormous amount of data generated from smart devices can overwhelm operators without being fully utilized. Operators often require extensive knowledge of the machines in use to make informed decisions during processes such as maintenance and production. To enable novice operators to access such knowledge, it is important to reinvent the way of interacting with digitally enhanced smart devices. In this research, a mobile augmented reality remote monitoring system is proposed to help operators with low knowledge and experience level comprehend digital twin data of a device and interact with the device. It analyses both historic logs as well as real-time data through a cloud server and enriches 2D data with 3D models and animations in the 3D physical space. A cloud-based machine learning algorithm is applied to transform learned knowledge into live presentations on a mobile device for users to interact with. A scaled-down case study is conducted using a tower crane model to demonstrate the potential benefits as well as implications when the system is deployed in industrial environments. This user study verifies that the proposed solution yields consistent measurable improvements for novice users in human-device interaction that is statistically significant","[{'title': 'Computers', 'identifiers': ['issn:2073-431X', '2073-431x']}]",'MDPI AG',An Integrated Mobile Augmented Reality Digital Twin Monitoring System,10.3390/computers10080099,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480206406,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The challenges proposed by the HL-LHC era are not limited to the sheer amount of data to be processed: the capability of optimizing the analyser's experience will also bring important benefits for the LHC communities, in terms of total resource needs, user satisfaction and in the reduction of end time to publication. At the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) a portable software stack for analysis has been proposed, based on cloud-native tools and capable of providing users with a fully integrated analysis environment for the CMS experiment. The main characterizing traits of the solution consist in the user-driven design and the portability to any cloud resource provider. All this is made possible via an evolution towards a “python-based” framework, that enables the usage of a set of open-source technologies largely adopted in both cloud-native and data-science environments. In addition, a “single sign on”-like experience is available thanks to the standards-based integration of INDIGO-IAM with all the tools. The integration of compute resources is done through the customization of a JupyterHUB solution, able to spawn identity-aware user instances ready to access data with no further setup actions. The integration with GPU resources is also available, designed to sustain more and more widespread ML based workflow. Seamless connections between the user UI and batch/big data processing framework (Spark, HTCondor) are possible. Eventually, the experiment data access latency is reduced thanks to the integrated deployment of a scalable set of caches, as developed in the context of ESCAPE project, and as such compatible with the future scenarios where a data-lake will be available for the research community.
The outcome of the evaluation of such a solution in action is presented, showing how a real CMS analysis workflow can make use of the infrastructure to achieve its results","[{'title': 'EPJ Web of Conferences', 'identifiers': ['2100-014x', 'issn:2100-014X']}]",'EDP Sciences',First experiences with a portable analysis infrastructure for LHC at INFN,10.1051/epjconf/202125102045,https://core.ac.uk/download/480206406.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
401914974,2021-03-29T00:00:00,"Purpose: This paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the Visual Arts industry in Malaysia. In general, this pandemic has affected various forms of artistic activities and the income of visual arts artists and galleries. The cancellation of art projects and exhibitions has greatly affected the artist's source of income as well as disrupted the sale of works and forms of art appreciation. The crisis has also opened up a new form to the visual arts industry by looking at alternative approaches to the continuity of the arts field by switching to virtual or online methods. This emerging crisis of COVID-19 might be the starting point for all art practitioners including artists, art critics, galleries/museums, collectors, and curators in using the online space to continue to capitalize on and expand the Visual Arts industry.
Design/methodology/approach: Review approach.
Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has made a huge impact on the country's Visual Arts industry where a wide range of art activities cannot be implemented and opened up opportunities for online activities
Practical implications: Exhibition and sale of works through online approach has become one of the main methods that support the Visual Arts industry with the application of a combination of the latest technologies such as VR and AI that enable the representation of real experiences in the context of art appreciation.
Originality/value: This paper is original.
Paper type: This paper can be categorized as a viewpoin",,'Narotama University',Covid -19: The Impact On Malaysian Visual Arts Scene,10.29138/ijebd.v4i2.1117,https://core.ac.uk/download/401914974.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
524551330,2022-03-04T00:00:00,"The aim of this study was to investigate and assess parents' and teachers' views of the home-visiting program as a method of early childhood education during the COVID-19 outbreak. Exploratory qualitative research employed as methods of inquiry. Twelve resource persons were interviewed (3 teachers and 9 parents). The data revealed, parents and teachers perceive that using home visits has a number of benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are as follows: 1) more effective than online; 2) make learning materials easy for children to understand; 3) pique children's interest and excitement for learning; and 4) eliminate the need for parents to assist their children with their tasks. Meanwhile, the downsides include the following: 1) it was inconvenient for parents because they were needed to entertain teachers and other children; 2) some pupils couldn't study because home visits were far away from their homes.; 3) additional media and learning activities preparation; 4) additional time and energy was wasted; and 5) the risk of exposure to COVID-19 was increased. The researchers recommend that additional study be conducted with a larger and more diverse sample size in order to obtain a more complete picture of this issue.

Social technologies (as technology of government of social processes, agents, organizations, communities) are the complex social phenomenon. Nowadays — the days of radical technological changes (Internet of things, Big Data, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotization, transition to a shared economy), redefining a wide range of social fields and generating principally new social regimes ad configurations — the social technologies acquire almost universal character. The exploration and practices (design, implementation, modification) of social technologies mean the work with the widest possible range of social phenomena, deploying on very different spatial and time scales and in various social spheres. At the same time, there remains a need for conceptual and theoretical clarification of “social technologies” on the other hand, and for their institualization as research and practical fields (with its own standards, human and organizational resources and so on). The department of social technologies was opened in Moscow State University establishment on Faculty of Sociology in 2013 to address that need.

479627403,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Seed purity directly affects the quality of seed breeding and subsequent processing products. Seed sorting based on machine vision provides an effective solution to this problem. The deep learning technology, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have exhibited impressive performance in image recognition and classification, and have been proven applicable in seed sorting. However the huge computational complexity and massive storage requirements make it a great challenge to deploy them in real-time applications, especially on devices with limited resources. In this study, a rapid and highly efficient lightweight CNN based on visual attention, namely SeedSortNet, is proposed for seed sorting. First, a dual-branch lightweight feature extraction module Shield-block is elaborately designed by performing identity mapping, spatial transformation at higher dimensions and different receptive field modeling, and thus it can alleviate information loss and effectively characterize the multi-scale feature while utilizing fewer parameters and lower computational complexity. In the down-sampling layer, the traditional MaxPool is replaced as MaxBlurPool to improve the shift-invariant of the network. Also, an extremely lightweight sub-feature space attention module (SFSAM) is presented to selectively emphasize fine-grained features and suppress the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that SeedSortNet achieves the accuracy rates of 97.33% and 99.56% on the maize seed dataset and sunflower seed dataset, respectively, and outperforms the mainstream lightweight networks (MobileNetv2, ShuffleNetv2, etc.) at similar computational costs, with only 0.400M parameters (vs. 4.06M, 5.40M)","[{'title': 'PeerJ Computer Science', 'identifiers': ['2376-5992', 'issn:2376-5992']}]",'PeerJ',SeedSortNet: a rapid and highly effificient lightweight CNN based on visual attention for seed sorting,10.7717/peerj-cs.639,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

402899368,2021-02-05T03:05:15,"© 2013 IEEE. We present a novel implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game interaction with a social robot. The framework is tailored to be computationally lightweight, as well as entertaining and visually appealing through collaboration with designers and animators. The fundamental gesture recognition pipeline employs a Leap motion device and two separate machine learning architectures to evaluate kinematic hand data on-the-fly. The first architecture is used to recognize and segment human motion activity in order to initialize the RPS play, and the second architecture is used to classify hand gestures into rock, paper or scissors. The employed tabletop robot interacts in the RPS play through unique animated gestural movements and vocalizations designed by animators which communicate the robot's choices as well as cognitive reflection on winning, losing and draw states. Performance of both learning architectures is carefully evaluated with respect to accuracy, reliability and run time performance under different feature and classifier types. Moreover, we assess our system during an interactive RPS play between robot and human. Experimental results show that the proposed system is robust to user variations and play style in real environment conditions. As such, it offers a powerful application for the subsequent exploration of social human-machine interaction","[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Developing a Lightweight Rock-Paper-Scissors Framework for Human-Robot Collaborative Gaming,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033550,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/145863/2/DevelopingaLightweightRockPaperScissorsFrameworkforHumanRobotCollaborativeGaming.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
489512242,2021-07-01T00:00:00,"Background and objectives: The multiple chest x-ray datasets released in the last years have ground-truth labels intended for different computer vision tasks, suggesting that performance in automated chest x-ray interpretation might improve by using a method that can exploit diverse types of annotations. This work presents a Deep Learning method based on the late fusion of different convolutional architectures, that allows training with heterogeneous data with a simple implementation, and evaluates its performance on independent test data. We focused on obtaining a clinically useful tool that could be successfully integrated into a hospital workflow. Materials and methods: Based on expert opinion, we selected four target chest x-ray findings, namely lung opacities, fractures, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. For each finding we defined the most suitable type of ground-truth label, and built four training datasets combining images from public chest x-ray datasets and our institutional archive. We trained four different Deep Learning architectures and combined their outputs with a late fusion strategy, obtaining a unified tool. The performance was measured on two test datasets: an external openly-available dataset, and a retrospective institutional dataset, to estimate performance on the local population. Results: The external and local test sets had 4376 and 1064 images, respectively, for which the model showed an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.74–0.76) and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.86–0.89) in the detection of abnormal chest x-rays. For the local population, a sensitivity of 86% (95%CI: 84–90), and a specificity of 88% (95%CI: 86–90) were obtained, with no significant differences between demographic subgroups. We present examples of heatmaps to show the accomplished level of interpretability, examining true and false positives. Conclusion: This study presents a new approach for exploiting heterogeneous labels from different chest x-ray datasets, by choosing Deep Learning architectures according to the radiological characteristics of each pathological finding. We estimated the tool's performance on the local population, obtaining results comparable to state-of-the-art metrics. We believe this approach is closer to the actual reading process of chest x-rays by professionals, and therefore more likely to be successful in a real clinical setting.Fil: Mosquera, Candelaria..

La colorización plantea un reto específico en visión computarizada para la reconstrucción de imágenes y video, tales como, la búsqueda de una fiel aproximación, la saturación correcta de colores escogidos y áreas no desfasadas.
La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
Proponemos el diseño e implementación de una herramienta de restauración de imágenes históricas de la ciudad de Barranquilla realizándoles un coloreado por medio de herramientas de computer vision. Cayena, nuestra aplicación web presenta una galería de imágenes de la historia de Barranquilla y de forma interactiva permite realizarles el coloreado. Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
We propose the design and implementation of a image restoration tool for historical images of the city of Barranquilla by applying a colorization using computer vision techniques. Cayena, our web application displays a gallery of historical images of Barranquilla and interactively allows to colorize them. In order to apply the colorization the application makes a request to our API that hosts the service and executes the colorization process; this colorization process consists in the processing of the image so it has the right size and the verification to make sure it is a grayscale image and transform it if it is not, and the subsequent execution of an pre trained CNN model using the Deep Learning framework ‘Caffe’ which predicts the possible real colors of the image",,"Barranquilla, Universidad del Norte, 2020",Automated colorization using Computer Vision tools for restoring historical images of the city of Barranquilla,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
392179445,2020-06-29T00:00:00,"Classification of multivariate time series (MTS) has
been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied
to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir computing (RC) provides
efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of
the MTS that can be further processed by standard classifiers.
Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classifiers based on
a standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of
fully trainable neural networks. In this article, we introduce the
reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on RC
to learn vectorial representations of MTS. Each MTS is encoded
within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a
low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared
with other RC methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance due to
an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second
contribution, we propose a modular RC framework for MTS
classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The
framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement
advanced RC architectures. The architectures are compared with
other MTS classifiers, including deep learning models and time

During the past decade, researchers have proposed many variants of machine learning techniques

However, no projects can yet be used on a large scale in real clinical practice because of the lack of standardized processes, lack of ethical and legal supervision, and other issues. We analyzed the existing problems in the field of artificial intelligence and herein propose possible solutions. We call for the establishment of a process framework to ensure the safety and orderly development of artificial intelligence in the medical industry.

479360462,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Introduction. An important part of an automotive unmanned vehicle (UV) control system is the environment analysis module. This module is based on various types of sensors, e.g. video cameras, lidars and radars. The development of computer and video technologies makes it possible to implement an environment analysis module using a single video camera as a sensor. This approach is expected to reduce the cost of the entire module. The main task in video image processing is to analyse the environment as a 3D scene. The 3D trajectory of an object, which takes into account its dimensions, angle of view and movement vector, as well as the vehicle pose in a video image, provides sufficient information for assessing the real interaction of objects. A basis for constructing a 3D trajectory is vehicle pose estimation.Aim. To develop an automatic method for estimating vehicle pose based on video data analysis from a single video camera.Materials and methods. An automatic method for vehicle pose estimation from a video image was proposed based on a cascade approach. The method includes vehicle detection, key points determination, segmentation and vehicle pose estimation. Vehicle detection and determination of its key points were resolved via a neural network. The segmentation of a vehicle video image and its mask preparation were implemented by transforming it into a polar coordinate system and searching for the outer contour using graph theory.Results. The estimation of vehicle pose was implemented by matching the Fourier image of vehicle mask signatures and the templates obtained based on 3D models. The correctness of the obtained vehicle pose and angle of view estimation was confirmed by experiments based on the proposed method. The vehicle pose estimation had an accuracy of 89 % on an open Carvana image dataset.Conclusion. A new approach for vehicle pose estimation was proposed, involving the transition from end-to-end learning of neural networks to resolve several problems at once, e.g., localization, classification, segmentation, and angle of view, towards cascade analysis of information. The accuracy level of end-to-end learning requires large sets of representative data, which complicates the scalability of solutions for road environments in Russia. The proposed method makes it possible to estimate the vehicle pose with a high accuracy level, at the same time as involving no large costs for manual data annotation and training","[{'title': 'Journal of the Russian Universities Radioelectronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:1993-8985', '1993-8985', 'issn:2658-4794', '2658-4794']}]",'St. Petersburg Electrotechnical University LETI',Method for Automatic Determination of a 3D Trajectory of Vehicles in a Video Image,10.32603/1993-8985-2021-24-3-49-59,https://core.ac.uk/download/479360462.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Tens of millions of messages per day are published by users of a particular social network need to be analyzed in real time for moderation in order to prevent the spread of various illegal or offensive information, threats and other types of toxic comments. Of course, such a large amount of information can be processed quite quickly only automatically. that is why there is a need to and a way to teach computers to “understand” a text written by humans. It is a non-trivial task even if the word “understand” here means only “to classify”. the rapid evolution of machine learning technologies has led to ubiquitous implementation of new algorithms. A lot of tasks, which for many years were considered almost impossible to solve, are now quite successfully solved using deep learning technologies. this article considers algorithms built using deep learning technologies and neural networks which can successfully solve the problem of detection and classification of toxic comments.

346367817,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, mm-Pose, a novel approach to detect and track human skeletons in real-time using an mmWave radar, is proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation. The proposed method was tested for a single human scenario for four primary motions, (i) Walking, (ii) Swinging left arm, (iii) Swinging right arm, and (iv) Swinging both arms to validate accurate predictions for motion in range, azimuth and elevation. The detailed methodology, implementation, challenges, and validation results are presented.University of ArizonaThis item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

Although of low complexity the resulting network achieves a high level of accuracy in iris region segmentation for challenging off-axis eye-patches. Interestingly, this network is also shown to achieve high levels of performance for regular, frontal, segmentation of iris regions, comparing favourably with state-of-the-art techniques of significantly higher complexity. Due to its lower complexity this network is well suited for deployment in embedded applications such as augmented and mixed reality headsets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While SAR research has recently experienced prolific growth, long-term trust, clinical translation and patient benefit remain immature. Affective human-robot interactions are unresolved and the deployment of robots with conversational abilities is fundamental for robustness and humanrobot engagement. In this paper, we review the state of the art within the past two decades, design trends, and current applications of conversational affective SAR for ageing and dementia support. A horizon scanning of AI voice technology for healthcare, including ubiquitous smart speakers, is further introduced to address current gaps inhibiting home use.

Most of the recent deep learning solutions for facial expression recognition under-perform when deployed in Human-Robot-Interaction scenarios, although they are capable of breaking records on the most varied benchmarks on facial expression recognition. The main reason for that we believe is that they are using techniques that are developed for recognition of static pictures, while in real-life scenarios, we infer emotions from intervals of expression.

478762459,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Big data technology has been developed rapidly in recent years. The performance improvement mechanism of targeted poverty alleviation is studied through the big data technology to further promote the comprehensive application of big data technology in poverty alleviation and development. Using the data mining knowledge to accurately identify the poor population under the framework of big data, compared with the traditional identification method, it is obviously more accurate and persuasive, which is also helpful to find out the real causes of poverty and assist the poor residents in the future. In the current targeted poverty alleviation work, the identification of poor households and the matching of assistance measures are mainly through the visiting of village cadres and the establishment of documents. Traditional methods are time-consuming, laborious, and difficult to manage. It always omits lots of useful family information. Therefore, new technologies need to be introduced to realize intelligent identification of poverty-stricken households and reduce labor costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel DBSCAN clustering algorithm via the edge computing-based deep neural network model for targeted poverty alleviation. First, we deploy an edge computing-based deep neural network model. Then, in this constructed model, we execute data mining for the poverty-stricken family. In this paper, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to excavate the poverty features of the poor households and complete the intelligent identification of the poor households. In view of the current situation of high-dimensional and large-volume poverty alleviation data, the algorithm uses the relative density difference of grid to divide the data space into regions with different densities and adopts the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the above result, which improves the accuracy of DBSCAN. This avoids the need for DBSCAN to traverse all data when searching for density connections. Finally, the proposed method is utilized for analyzing and mining the poverty alleviation data. The average accuracy is more than 96%. The average F-measure, NMI, and PRE values exceed 90%. The results show that it provides decision support for precise matching and intelligent pairing of village cadres in poverty alleviation work","[{'title': 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing', 'identifiers': ['1530-8677', 'issn:1530-8677']}]",'Hindawi Limited',A Novel DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm via Edge Computing-Based Deep Neural Network Model for Targeted Poverty Alleviation Big Data,10.1155/2021/5536579,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They are trained in a batch learning mode; hence, the whole training data should be ready before the training task. However, this is not applicable for many real-time applications where data arrive sequentially such as online topic-detection in social communities, traffic flow prediction, etc. In this paper, an efficient hardware implementation of a low-latency online neural network system is proposed for a traffic flow prediction application. The proposed model is implemented with different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the traffic flow with high accuracy where the Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) model achieves the least mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.001. The proposed system is implemented using floating point and fixed point arithmetics on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the ZedBoard. The implementation is provided using BRAM architecture and distributed memory in FPGA in order to achieve the best trade-off between latency, the consumption of area, and power. Using the fixed point approach, the prediction times using the distributed memory and BRAM architectures are 150 ns and 420 ns, respectively. The area delay product (ADP) of the proposed system is reduced by 17 × compared with the hardware implementation of the latest proposed system in the literature. The execution time of the proposed hardware system is improved by 200 × compared with the software implemented on a dual core Intel i7-7500U CPU at 2.9 GHz.

480278110,2021-12-01T00:00:00,"Among the wide variety of malicious behavior commonly observed in modern social platforms, one of the most notorious is the diffusion of fake news, given its potential to influence the opinions of millions of people who can be voters, consumers, or simply citizens going about their daily lives. In this paper, we implement and carry out an empirical evaluation of a version of the recently-proposed NetDER architecture for hybrid AI decision-support systems with the capability of leveraging the availability of machine learning modules, logical reasoning about unknown objects, and forecasts based on diffusion processes. NetDER is a general architecture for reasoning about different kinds of malicious behavior such as dissemination of fake news, hate speech, and malware, detection of botnet operations, prevention of cyber attacks including those targeting software products or blockchain transactions, among others. Here, we focus on the case of fake news dissemination on social platforms by three different kinds of users: non-malicious, malicious, and botnet members. In particular, we focus on three tasks: (i) determining who is responsible for posting a fake news article, (ii) detecting malicious users, and (iii) detecting which users belong to a botnet designed to disseminate fake news. Given the difficulty of obtaining adequate data with ground truth, we also develop a testbed that combines real-world fake news datasets with synthetically generated networks of users and fully-detailed traces of their behavior throughout a series of time points. We designed our testbed to be customizable for different problem sizes and settings, and make its code publicly available to be used in similar evaluation efforts. Finally, we report on the results of a thorough experimental evaluation of three variants of our model and six environmental settings over the three tasks. Our results clearly show the effects that the quality of knowledge engineering tasks, the quality of the underlying machine learning classifier used to detect fake news, and the specific environmental conditions have on smart policing efforts in social platforms.Fil: Paredes, José Nicolás.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation.

387260665,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

323141626,2020-01-01T08:00:00,"2020 Elsevier Ltd Smart cities are conceptualized as a vehicle for sustainable urban development and a means to deliver high quality of life for residents. One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city\u27s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring",,'Sociological Research Online',A sentiment reporting framework for major city events: Case study on the China-United States trade war,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk.

The control architecture for this robot includes a common Knowledge-base (ontologies), Data-base, “Hybrid Artificial Brain” (dialogue manager, action selection and explainable AI), Activities Centre (Timeline, Quiz, Break and Sort, Memory, Tip of the Day, ), Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA, i.e., robot and avatar), and Dashboards (for authoring and monitoring the interaction).

There is thus a pressing need for unconventional computing approaches, ones that can exploit the high bandwidths/speeds and low losses intrinsic to photonics. A promising platform for such a purpose is that offered by integrated phase-change photonics. Here, chalcogenide phase-change materials are incorporated into standard integrated photonics devices to deliver wide-ranging computational functionality, including non-volatile memory and fast, low-energy arithmetic and neuromorphic processing.

Moreover, our model is readily incorporated with commercially available simulation software for photonic integrated circuits, thereby enabling the design, simulation and optimization of large-scale phase-change photonics systems. We demonstrate such capabilities by exploring the optimization and simulation of the operating characteristics of two important phase-change photonic systems recently reported, namely a spiking neural network system and a matrix-vector photonic crossbar array (photonic tensor core).

322656801,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In any water utility, a reliable assessment of the service life of the network pipes is a key piece within the big puzzle of assets management. This paper presents a new statistical model (basic pipes life assessment, BPLA) to assess the service life of pipes, to locate the pipes on the failures bath curve and to forecast the expected failures in future years. Its main novelties are the processing of pipe information (is that information what is adapted to the classical maintenance engineering and not the other way back) and the definition of two different time variables that can be analyzed in parallel. The first novelty makes the model less demanding in terms of data and software tools than others currently available, and the second one allows to get all the results after one single stage of calculation. To show its usability, the BPLA has been applied to a pipe network that supplies water to 500,000 citizens for which two years of failure records are available. Procedures and results have been compared to the well-known Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM), with final relative errors lower than 10% and 15% on each particular result.The authors would like to thank Global Omnium for the support provided, both directly and through the Catedra Aguas de Valencia of the UPV, for the development of the works presented in this paper.Ramírez-Aguilar, RX.; López Jiménez, PA.; Torres Toro, D.; Cobacho Jordán, R.

395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

523156438,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The adoption of fast-paced practices for developing virtual network functions (VNFs) allows for continuous software delivery and creates a market advantage for network operators. This adoption, however, is problematic for testing engineers that need to assure, in shorter development cycles, certain quality of highly-configurable product releases running on heterogeneous clouds. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate testing workflows by detecting performance issues in new software builds. However, the overhead of maintaining several models for all combinations of build types, network configurations, and other stack parameters, can quickly become prohibitive and make the application of ML infeasible.



We propose Env2Vec, a deep learning architecture that combines contextual features with historical resource usage, and characterizes the various stack parameters that influence the test execution within an embedding space, which allows it to generalize model predictions to previously unseen environments. We integrate a single ML model in the testing workflow to automatically debug errors and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. Results obtained with real testing data show an accuracy between 86.2%-100%, while reducing the false alarm rate by 20.9%-38.1% when reporting performance issues compared to state-of-the-art approaches",,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',Env2Vec: accelerating VNF testing with deep learning,10.1145/3342195.3387525,https://core.ac.uk/download/523156438.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480045276,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"A computationally efficient method for online joint state inference and dynamical model learning is presented. The dynamical model combines an a priori known, physically derived, state-space model with a radial basis function expansion representing unknown system dynamics and inherits properties from both physical and data-driven modeling. The method uses an extended Kalman filter approach to jointly estimate the state of the system and learn the unknown system dynamics, via the parameters of the basis function expansion. The key contribution is a computational complexity reduction compared to a similar approach with globally supported basis functions. By using compactly supported radial basis functions and an approximate Kalman gain, the computational complexity is considerably reduced and is essentially determined by the support of the basis functions. The approximation works well when the system dynamics exhibit limited correlation between points well separated in the state-space domain. The method is exemplified via two intelligent vehicle applications where it is shown to: (i) have competitive system dynamics estimation performance compared to the globally supported basis function method, and (ii) be real-time applicable to problems with a large-scale state-space.Funding: Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Online Joint State Inference and Learning of Partially Unknown State-Space Models,10.1109/TSP.2021.3095709,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
288570495,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Performing multi-objective optimization under uncertainty is a common requirement in industries and academia. Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has access to behavioral data for the uncertain parameters. However, solutions of RO may be far from the real solution and less reliable due to inability to map the uncertain space accurately, especially when the data appears discontinuous and scattered in the uncertain domain. Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study. Considered case-studies include highly nonlinear model for continuous casting process from steelmaking industries, where a multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is solved to balance the conflict between productivity and energy consumption. The Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting RO problem are obtained through Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, and ∼23 – 29% improvement is observed in the objective functions. Further, the spread and diversity metrics are enhanced by ∼10 – 95% as compared to those obtained using other standard uncertainty sets",,'Elsevier BV',Towards Efficient Robust Optimization using Data based Optimal Segmentation of Uncertain Space,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106821,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
483447297,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The EO-ALERT European Commission H2020 project proposes the definition, development, and verification and

validation through ground hardware testing, of a next-generation Earth Observation (EO) data processing chain. The

proposed data processing chain is based on a novel flight segment architecture that moves EO data processing

elements traditionally executed in the ground segment to on-board the satellite, with the aim of delivering EO

products to the end user with very low latency. EO-ALERT achieves, globally, latencies below five minutes for EO

products delivery, and below one minute in realistic scenarios.

The proposed EO-ALERT architecture is enabled by on-board processing, recent improvements in processing

hardware using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, and persistent space-to-ground communications

links. EO-ALERT combines innovations in the on-board elements of the data chain and the communications,

namely: on-board reconfigurable data handling, on-board image generation and processing for the generation of

alerts (EO products) using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), on-board AI-based compression and encryption, high-speed on-board avionics, and reconfigurable high data rate communication links

to ground, including a separate chain for alerts with minimum latency and global coverage.

This paper presents the proposed architecture, its hardware realization for the ground testing in a representative

environment and its performance. The architecture’s performance is evaluated considering two different user

scenarios where very low latency (almost-real-time) EO product delivery is required: ship detection and extreme

weather monitoring/nowcasting. The hardware testing results show that, when implemented using COTS

components and available communication links, the proposed architecture can deliver alerts to the end user with a

latency below five minutes, for both SAR and Optical missions, demonstrating the viability of the EO-ALERT

architecture. In particular, in several test scenarios, for both the TerraSAR-X SAR and DEIMOS-2 Optical Very

High Resolution (VHR) missions, hardware testing of the proposed architecture has shown it can deliver EO

products and alerts to the end user globally, with latency lower than one-point-five minutes",,,A Novel Architecture for the Next Generation of Earth Observation Satellites Supporting Rapid Civil Alert,,https://core.ac.uk/download/483447297.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

477671455,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"This research is concerned with the novel application and investigation of ‘Soft Actor Critic’ based deep reinforcement learning to control the cooling setpoint (and hence cooling loads) of a large commercial building to harness energy flexibility. The research is motivated by the challenge associated with the development and application of conventional model-based control approaches at scale to the wider building stock. Soft Actor Critic is a model-free deep reinforcement learning technique that is able to handle continuous action spaces and which has seen limited application to real-life or high-fidelity simulation implementations in the context of automated and intelligent control of building energy systems. Such control techniques are seen as one possible solution to supporting the operation of a smart, sustainable and future electrical grid. This research tests the suitability of the technique through training and deployment of the agent on an EnergyPlus based environment of the office building. The agent was found to learn an optimal control policy that was able to minimise energy costs by 9.7% compared to the default rule-based control scheme and was able to improve or maintain thermal comfort limits over a test period of one week. The algorithm was shown to be robust to the different hyperparameters and this optimal control policy was learnt through the use of a minimal state space consisting of readily available variables. The robustness of the algorithm was tested through investigation of the speed of learning and ability to deploy to different seasons and climates. It was found that the agent requires minimal training sample points and outperforms the baseline after three months of operation and also without disruption to thermal comfort during this period. The agent is transferable to other climates and seasons although further retraining or hyperparameter tuning is recommended","[{'title': 'Energy and AI', 'identifiers': ['issn:2666-5468', '2666-5468']}]",'Elsevier BV',Development of a Soft Actor Critic deep reinforcement learning approach for harnessing energy flexibility in a Large Office building,10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100101,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although a thorough and consistent benchmarking procedure can allow us to estimate the expected operational abilities of the underlying deep model, this topic remains under-researched. This paper tackles this issue and presents an end-to-end benchmarking approach for quantifying the abilities of deep learning algorithms in virtually any kind of on-board space applications. The experimental validation, performed over several state-of-the-art deep models and benchmark datasets, showed that different deep learning techniques may be effectively benchmarked using the standardized approach, which delivers quantifiable performance measures and is highly configurable. We believe that such benchmarking is crucial in delivering ready-to-use on-board artificial intelligence in emerging space applications and should become a standard tool in the deployment chain","[{'title': 'Remote Sensing', 'identifiers': ['2072-4292', 'issn:2072-4292']}]",'MDPI AG',Benchmarking Deep Learning for On-Board Space Applications,10.3390/rs13193981,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Is this transformation a blessing or a curse for psychiatry? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and eHealth services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that eHealth services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor–patient relationships.

491084922,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Miniaturization of electronics devices is often limited by the concomitant high heat fluxes (cooling load) and maldistribution of temperature profiles (hot spots). Thermal energy storage (TES) platforms providing supplemental cooling can be a cost-effective solution, that often leverages phase change materials (PCM). Although salt hydrates provide higher storage capacities and power ratings (as compared to that of the organic PCMs), they suffer from reliability issues (e.g., supercooling). “Cold Finger Technique (CFT)” can obviate supercooling by maintaining a small mass fraction of the PCM in a solid state for enabling spontaneous nucleation. Optimization of CFT necessitates real-time forecasting of the transient values of the melt-fraction. In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) is explored for real-time prediction of the time remaining to reach a target value of melt-fraction based on the prior history of the spatial distribution of the surface temperature transients. Two different approaches were explored for training the ANN model, using: (1) transient PCM-temperature data; or (2) transient surface-temperature data. When deployed in a heat sink that leverages PCM-based passive thermal management systems for cooling electronic chips and packages, this maverick approach (using the second method) affords cheaper costs, better sustainability, higher reliability, and resilience. The error in prediction varies during the melting process. During the final stages of the melting cycle, the errors in the predicted values are ~5% of the total time-scale of the PCM melting experiments","[{'title': 'Electronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2079-9292', '2079-9292']}]",'MDPI AG',Machine Learning (ML) Based Thermal Management for Cooling of Electronics Chips by Utilizing Thermal Energy Storage (TES) in Packaging That Leverages Phase Change Materials (PCM),10.3390/electronics10222785,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis. This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced Blanchard et al., 2011. We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm.

There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures.

Semantic segmentation can be applied by adopting different techniques, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, in the present work, a residual neural network is implemented by engaging in ResNet-18 transfer learning to distinguish between the floor, which is the navigation free space, and the walls, which are the obstacles. After the learning process, the semantic segmentation floor mask is used to implement indoor navigation and motion calculations for the autonomous mobile robot. This motion calculations are based on how much the estimated path differs from the center vertical line. The highest point is used to move the motors toward that direction. In this way, the robot can move in a real scenario by avoiding different obstacles.

By the time of this article, most states have mandated face masking in public space. Therefore, real-time face mask detection becomes an essential application to prevent the spread of the pandemic. This study will present a face mask detection system that can detect and monitor mask-wearing from camera feeds and alert when there is a violation. The face mask detection algorithm uses a haar cascade classifier to find facial features from the camera feed and then utilizes it to detect the mask-wearing status. With the increasing number of cases all over the world, a system to replace humans to check masks on the faces of people is greatly needed. This system satisfies that need. This system can be employed in public places like transport stations and malls. It will be of great help in companies and huge establishments where there will be a lot of workers.   Alongside this, we have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output the presence or absence of a face mask in an image or a video stream. Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data with 100 percent and 99 percent precision and recall, respectively. We are making a savvy framework that will identify whether the specific user has worn the mask or not and further tell the accuracy level of the detection. Our framework will be python and AI-based which will be safe and quick for implementation.  This system will be of great help there because it is easy to obtain and store the data of the employees working in that Company and will very easily find the people who are not wearing the mask and a will be  sent to that respective person to take Precautions not wearing a mask.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples.

First we apply statistical generalization to compute an approximation for the optimal control policy as defined by training movements that solve the given task in a number of specific situations. This way we obtain a manifold of movements, which dimensionality is usually much smaller than the dimensionality of a full space of movement primitives. Next we refine the policy by means of reinforcement learning on the approximating manifold, which results in a learning problem constrained to the low dimensional manifold. We show that in some situations, learning on the low dimensional manifold can be implemented as an error learning algorithm. We apply golden section search to refine the control policy. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with an extended parameter set, which combines learning in constrained domain with learning in full space of parametric movement primitives, which makes it possible to explore actions outside of the initial approximating manifold.

This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of big data, problems of data collection, its reliability and use. Big data can be used for the analysis and modeling of phenomena relevant to public governance and social policy. Big data consist of three main types: a) historical data, b) present data with little delay, c) prognostic data for future forecasting. The following categories of big data can be defined as: a) data from social networks, b) traditional data from business systems, c) machine-generated data, such as water extraction, pollution, satellite information. The article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of big data. There are big data challenges such as data security, lack of cooperation in civil service and social work, in rare situations – data fragmentation, incompleteness and erroneous issues, as well as ethical issues regarding the analysis of data and its use in social policy and social administration.
Big data, covered by Artificial Intelligence, can be used in public governance and social policy by identifying “the hot spots” of various phenomena, by prognosing the meanings of variables in the future on the basis of past time rows, and by calculating the optimal motion of actions in the situations where there are possible various alternatives. The technologies of Artificial Intelligence are used more profoundly in many spheres of public policy, and in the governance of COVID-19 pandemics too.
The substantial advantages of the provided big data and Artificial Intelligence are a holistic improvement of public services, possibilities of personalization, the enhancement of citizen satisfaction, the diminishing of the costs of processing expenditure, the targeting of adopted and implemented decisions, more active involvement of citizens, the feedback of the preferences of policy formation and implementation, the observation of social phenomenas in real time, and possibilities for more detailed prognosing.
Challenges to security of data, necessary resources and competences, the lack of cooperation in public service, especially rare instances of data fragmentation, roughness, falseness, and ethical questions regarding data analysis and application can be evaluated as the most significant problems of using big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.
Big data and their analytics conducted using Artificial Intelligence technologies can contribute to the adequacy and objectivity of decisions in public governance and social policy, effectively curbing corruption and nepotism by raising the authority and confidence of public sector organizations in governance, which is so lacking in the modern world.Šiame tarpdisciplininiame straipsnyje pateikiama XXI amžiaus ketvirtosios pramonės revoliucijos fenomenų – didžiųjų duomenų ir dirbtinio intelekto technologijų – samprata ir aptariamos jų naudojimo viešojo valdymo srityje ir socialinėje politikoje galimybės, nagrinėjami didžiųjų duomenų pranašumai ir trūkumai, jų rinkimo, patikimumo ir naudojimo problemos.

The simulation results using MATLAB and R software show that the model is capable of producing a reasonable accuracy","[{'title': 'Journal of Applied Mathematics', 'identifiers': ['issn:1110-757X', '1687-0042', 'issn:1687-0042', '1110-757x']}]",'Hindawi Limited',Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network and Extended Kalman Filters for Prediction of Financial Time Series,10.1155/2020/5057801,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491009957,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"As machining processes are complex in nature due to the involvement of large plastic strains occurring at higher strain rates, and simultaneous thermal softening of material, it is necessary for manufacturers to have some manner of determining whether the inputs will achieve the desired outputs within the limitations of available resources. However, finite element simulations—the most common means to analyze and understand the machining of high-performance materials under various cutting conditions and environments—require high amounts of processing power and time in order to output reliable and accurate results which can lead to delays in the initiation of manufacture. The objective of this study is to reduce the time required prior to fabrication to determine how available inputs will affect the desired outputs and machining parameters. This study proposes a hybrid predictive methodology where finite element simulation data and machine learning are combined by feeding the time series output data generated by Finite Element Modeling to an Artificial Neural Network in order to acquire reliable predictions of optimal and/or expected machining inputs (depending on the application of the proposed approach) using what we describe as a backwards training model. The trained network was then fed a test dataset from the simulations, and the results acquired show a high degree of accuracy with regards to cutting force and depth of cut, whereas the predicted/expected feed rate was wildly inaccurate. This is believed to be due to either a limited dataset or the much stronger effect that cutting speed and depth of cut have on power, cutting forces, etc., as opposed to the feed rate. It shows great promise for further research to be performed for implementation in manufacturing facilities for the generation of optimal inputs or the real-time monitoring of input conditions to ensure machining conditions do not vary beyond the norm during the machining process","[{'title': 'Materials', 'identifiers': ['issn:1996-1944', '1996-1944']}]",'MDPI AG',A Hybrid Finite Element—Machine Learning Backward Training Approach to Analyze the Optimal Machining Conditions,10.3390/ma14216717,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491096314,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Proprioception, the ability to perceive one's own configuration and movement in space, enables organisms to safely and accurately interact with their environment and each other. The underlying sensory nerves that make this possible are highly dense and use sophisticated communication pathways to propagate signals from nerves in muscle, skin, and joints to the central nervous system wherein the organism can process and react to stimuli. In a step forward to realize robots with such perceptive capability, a flexible sensor framework that incorporates a novel modeling strategy, taking advantage of computational mechanics and machine learning, is proposed. The sensor framework on a large flexible sensor that transforms sparsely distributed strains into continuous surface is implemented. Finite element (FE) analysis is utilized to determine design parameters, while an FE model is built to enrich the morphological data used in the supervised training to achieve continuous surface reconstruction. A mapping between the local strain data and the enriched surface data is subsequently trained using ensemble learning. This hybrid approach enables real time, robust, and high‐order surface reconstruction. The sensing performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and feasibility with numerous scenarios, which has not been demonstrated on such a large‐scale sensor before","[{'title': 'Advanced Intelligent Systems', 'identifiers': ['2640-4567', 'issn:2640-4567']}]",'Wiley',Large‐Scale Surface Shape Sensing with Learning‐Based Computational Mechanics,10.1002/aisy.202100089,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
482629957,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"Objective: Traditionally, cadaveric courses have been an important tool in surgical education for Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). The recent COVID-19 pandemic, however, has had a significant global impact on such courses due to its travel restrictions, social distancing regulations, and infection risk. Here, we report the world-first remote (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) FESS training course between Japan and Australia, utilizing novel 3D-printed sinus models. We examined the feasibility and educational effect of the course conducted entirely remotely with encrypted telemedicine software.Methods: Three otolaryngologists in Hokkaido, Japan, were trained to perform frontal sinus dissections on novel 3D sinus models of increasing difficulty, by two rhinologists located in Adelaide, South Australia. The advanced manufactured sinus models were 3D printed from the Computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Using Zoom and the Quintree telemedicine platform, the surgeons in Adelaide first lectured the Japanese surgeons on the Building Block Concept for a three Dimensional understanding of the frontal recess. They in real time directly supervised the surgeons as they planned and then performed the frontal sinus dissections. The Japanese surgeons were asked to complete a questionnaire pertaining to their experience and the time taken to perform the frontal dissection was recorded. The course was streamed to over 200 otolaryngologists worldwide.Results: All dissectors completed five frontal sinusotomies. The time to identify the frontal sinus drainage pathway (FSDP) significantly reduced from 1,292 ± 672 to 321 ± 267 s (p = 0.02), despite an increase in the difficulty of the frontal recess anatomy. Image analysis revealed the volume of FSDP was improved (2.36 ± 0.00 to 9.70 ± 1.49 ml, p = 0.014). Questionnaires showed the course's general benefit was 95.47 ± 5.13 in dissectors and 89.24 ± 15.75 in audiences.Conclusion: The combination of telemedicine software, web-conferencing technology, standardized 3D sinus models, and expert supervision, provides excellent training outcomes for surgeons in circumstances when classical surgical workshops cannot be realized","[{'title': 'Frontiers in Surgery', 'identifiers': ['issn:2296-875X', '2296-875x']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',Remote Training of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery With Advanced Manufactured 3D Sinus Models and a Telemedicine System,10.3389/fsurg.2021.746837,https://core.ac.uk/download/482629957.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R). The work of Patricia Pons is supported by a national grant from the Spanish MECD (FPU13/03831).

478204378,2021-08-26T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods & Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of > 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P < 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",,'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,10.22456/1679-9216.111167,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
390193721,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceIn the problem of domain generalization (DG), there are labeled training data sets from several related prediction problems, and the goal is to make accurate predictions on future unlabeled data sets that are not known to the learner. This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis. This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced Blanchard et al., 2011. We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm. An efficient implementation is provided for this algorithm, which is experimentally compared to a pooling strategy on one synthetic and three real-world data sets",,Microtome Publishing,Domain Generalization by Marginal Transfer Learning,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The quality of water resources depends on the effectiveness of water treatment plants to reduce chemical pollutants, such as nitrates, pharmaceuticals, or microplastics.

In this study, we test the feasibility of a deep UV Raman spectrometer for the detection of nitrate/nitrite, selected pharmaceuticals and the most widespread microplastic polymers. Software utilizing artificial intelligence, such as a convolutional neural network, is trained for recognizing typical spectral patterns of individual pollutants, once processed by mathematical filters and machine learning algorithms.

479312419,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables enterprises to manage large amounts of data in order to derive predictions about future performance and to gain meaningful insights. In this context, descriptive and predictive analytics has gained a significant research attention; however, prescriptive analytics has just started to emerge as the next step towards increasing data analytics maturity and leading to optimized decision making ahead of time. Although machine learning for decision making has been identified as one of the most important applications of AI, up to now, prescriptive analytics is mainly addressed with domain-specific optimization models. On the other hand, existing literature lacks generalized prescriptive analytics models capable of being dynamically adapted according to the human preferences. Reinforcement Learning, as the third machine learning paradigm alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning, has the potential to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and time-variant environments, the huge states space of sequential decision making processes, as well as the incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we propose a human-augmented prescriptive analytics approach using Interactive Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (IMORL) in order to cope with the complexity of real-life environments and the need for optimized human-machine collaboration. The decision making process is modelled in a generalized way in order to assure scalability and applicability in a wide range of problems and applications.

441907616,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"Background and Aim: In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in poultry are still reported. The disease causes a decrease in egg production and an increase in mortality; this has an impact on the economic losses of farmers. Several studies have considered that ducks play a role in the HPAI endemicity in the country; however, little is known about whether or not the type of duck farming is associated with HPAI H5 virus infection, particularly within clade 2.3.2.1c, which has been predominantly found in poultry since 2014. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the HPAI seroprevalence for H5 subtype clade 2.3.2.1c in laying ducks that are kept intensively and nomadically and to determine the associated risk factors.



Materials and Methods: Forty-nine duck farmers were randomly selected from ten sub-districts in Purbalingga District, Central Java, Indonesia; a cross-sectional study was implemented to collect field data. Based on an expected HPAI prevalence level of 10%, estimated accuracy of ± 5%, and 95% confidence interval (CI), the total sample size was calculated at 36 individuals. Samples must be multiplied by 7 to reduce bias; thus, 252 ducks were taken as samples in this study. Considering that the maintenance and duck handling were uniform and farmers complained that the effect of activity to take duck samples would reduce egg production, this study only took samples from 245 ducks (oropharyngeal swabs and serum). Those samples were taken from five birds on each farm. Hemagglutination inhibition tests examined the serum samples for HPAI H5 Clade 2.3.2.1c, and pool swab samples (five swabs in one viral media transport) were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test for influenza Type A and H5 subtype virus. Information regarding farm management was obtained using a questionnaire; face-to-face interviews were conducted with the duck farmers using native Javanese language.



Results: Serum and swabs from 245 ducks were collected in total. For individual birds, 54.69% (134/245) of serum samples were H5 seropositive. Seroprevalence among nomadic ducks was 59.28% (95% CI: 0.48-0.61), which was higher than among intensively farmed ducks (48.57%, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58). Farm-level seroprevalence was 50% (95% CI: 0.30-0.69) for nomadic ducks but only 28.57% (95% CI: 0.11-0.51) for intensively farmed ducks. The farm-level virus prevalence (proportion of flocks with at least one bird positive for influenza Type A) was 17.85% (95% CI: 0.07-0.35) for nomadic ducks and 4.76% (1/21) for intensively farmed ducks (95% CI: 0.008-0.23). All influenza Type A positive samples were negative for the H5 subtype, indicating that another HA subtype AI viruses might have been circulating in ducks in the study area. A relationship between duck farms that were H5 seropositive and their maintenance system was present; however, this relationship was not significant, the nomadic duck system detected 2 times higher H5-seropositive ducks than the intensive farming system (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 0.33-14.31).



Conclusion: This study found that the seroprevalence of HPAI in the duck population level in Purbalingga was 54.69% and demonstrated that the nomadic duck farming system was more likely to acquire HPAI H5 infection than the intensive farming duck system. Other risk factors should be further investigated as the diversity of the farming system is partially related to HPAI H5 infection","[{'title': 'Veterinary World', 'identifiers': ['issn:2231-0916', '2231-0916', 'issn:0972-8988', '0972-8988']}]",'Veterinary World',"Determining highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza clade 2.3.2.1c seroprevalence in ducks, Purbalingga, Central Java, Indonesia",10.14202/vetworld.2020.1138-1144,https://core.ac.uk/download/441907616.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
328925501,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"Combining high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a linear accelerator (Linac) as a single MRI-Linac system provides the capability to monitor intra-fractional motion and anatomical changes during radiotherapy, which facilitates more accurate delivery of radiation dose to the tumour and less exposure to healthy tissue. The gradient non-linearity (GNL) induced distortions in MRI; however, hinder the implementation of MRI-Linac system in image-guided radiotherapy where highly accurate geometry and anatomy of the target tumour is indispensable.To correct the geometric distortions in MR images, in particular, for the 1 Tesla (T) MRI-Linac system, a deep fully-connected neural network was proposed to automatically learn the intricate relationship between the undistorted (theoretical) and distorted (real) space. A data set, consisting of spatial samples acquired by phantom measurement that covers both inside and outside the working diameter of spherical volume (DSV), was utilised for training the neural network; which offers the ability to describe subtle deviations of the GNL field within the entire region of interest (ROI).The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MR images of a three-dimensional (3D) phantom and the pelvic region of an adult volunteer scanned in the 1T MRI-Linac system. The experimental results showed that the severe geometric distortions within the entire ROI had been successfully corrected with an error less than the pixel size. Also, the presented network is highly efficient, which achieved significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to existing methods.The feasibility of the presented deep neural network for characterising the GNL field deviations in the 1T MRI-Linac system was demonstrated in this study, which shows promise in facilitating the MRI-Linac system to be routinely implemented in real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy",,'Wiley',Fast geometric distortion correction using a deep neural network: implementation for the 1 Tesla MRI-Linac system,10.1002/mp.14382,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
429357144,2021-05-01T00:00:00,"Abstract We explore the potential of feed‐forward deep neural networks (DNNs) for emulating cloud superparameterization in realistic geography, using offline fits to data from the superparameterized community atmospheric model. To identify the network architecture of greatest skill, we formally optimize hyperparameters using ∼250 trials. Our DNN explains over 70% of the temporal variance at the 15‐min sampling scale throughout the mid‐to‐upper troposphere. Autocorrelation timescale analysis compared against DNN skill suggests the less good fit in the tropical, marine boundary layer is driven by neural network difficulty emulating fast, stochastic signals in convection. However, spectral analysis in the temporal domain indicates skillful emulation of signals on diurnal to synoptic scales. A closer look at the diurnal cycle reveals correct emulation of land‐sea contrasts and vertical structure in the heating and moistening fields, but some distortion of precipitation. Sensitivity tests targeting precipitation skill reveal complementary effects of adding positive constraints versus hyperparameter tuning, motivating the use of both in the future. A first attempt to force an offline land model with DNN emulated atmospheric fields produces reassuring results further supporting neural network emulation viability in real‐geography settings. Overall, the fit skill is competitive with recent attempts by sophisticated Residual and Convolutional Neural Network architectures trained on added information, including memory of past states. Our results confirm the parameterizability of superparameterized convection with continents through machine learning and we highlight the advantages of casting this problem locally in space and time for accurate emulation and hopefully quick implementation of hybrid climate models","[{'title': 'Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems', 'identifiers': ['issn:1942-2466', '1942-2466']}]",'American Geophysical Union (AGU)',Assessing the Potential of Deep Learning for Emulating Cloud Superparameterization in Climate Models With Real‐Geography Boundary Conditions,10.1029/2020MS002385,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479626782,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"A computationally efficient method for online joint state inference and dynamical model learning is presented. The dynamical model combines an a priori known, physically derived, state-space model with a radial basis function expansion representing unknown system dynamics and inherits properties from both physical and data-driven modeling. The method uses an extended Kalman filter approach to jointly estimate the state of the system and learn the unknown system dynamics, via the parameters of the basis function expansion. The key contribution is a computational complexity reduction compared to a similar approach with globally supported basis functions. By using compactly supported radial basis functions and an approximate Kalman gain, the computational complexity is considerably reduced and is essentially determined by the support of the basis functions. The approximation works well when the system dynamics exhibit limited correlation between points well separated in the state-space domain. The method is exemplified via two intelligent vehicle applications where it is shown to: (i) have competitive system dynamics estimation performance compared to the globally supported basis function method, and (ii) be real-time applicable to problems with a large-scale state-space.Funding: Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Online Joint State Inference and Learning of Partially Unknown State-Space Models,10.1109/TSP.2021.3095709,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
482691058,2021-11-11T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a relatively new concept that involves the merging of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT). It has emerged from the realization that Internet of Things networks could be further enhanced if they were also provided with Artificial Intelligence, enhancing the extraction of data and network operation. Prior to AIoT, the Internet of Things would consist of networks of sensors embedded in a physical environment, that collected data and sent them to a remote server. Upon reaching the server, a data analysis would be carried out which normally involved the application of a series of Artificial Intelligence techniques by experts. However, as Internet of Things networks expand in smart cities, this workflow makes optimal operation unfeasible. This is because the data that is captured by IoT is increasing in size continually. Sending such amounts of data to a remote server becomes costly, time-consuming and resource inefficient. Moreover, dependence on a central server means that a server failure, which would be imminent if overloaded with data, would lead to a halt in the operation of the smart service for which the IoT network had been deployed. Thus, decentralizing the operation becomes a crucial element of AIoT. This is done through the Edge Computing paradigm which takes the processing of data to the edge of the network. Artificial Intelligence is found at the edge of the network so that the data may be processed, filtered and analyzed there.  It is even possible to equip the edge of the network with the ability to make decisions through the implementation of AI techniques such as Machine Learning. The speed of decision making at the edge of the network means that many social, environmental, industrial and administrative processes may be optimized, as crucial decisions may be taken faster. 

Deep Intelligence is a tool that employs disruptive Artificial Intelligence techniques for data analysis i.e., classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to extract data from virtually any source type. This is a very important feature given the heterogeneity of the data being produced in the world today. Another very important characteristic is its intuitiveness and ability to operate almost autonomously.  The user is guided through the process which means that anyone can use it without any knowledge of the technical, technological and mathematical aspects of the processes performed by the platform. This means that the Deepint.net platform integrates functionalities that would normally take years to implement in any sector individually and that would normally require a group of experts in data analysis and related technologies [1-322]. 

The Deep Intelligence platform can be used to easily operate Edge Computing architectures and IoT networks. The joint characteristics of a well-designed Edge Computing platform (that is, one which brings computing resources to the edge of the network) and of the advanced Deepint.net platform deployed in a cloud environment, mean that high speed, real-time response, effective troubleshooting and management, as well as precise forecasting can be achieved. 

Moreover, the low cost of the solution, in combination with the availability of low-cost sensors, devices, Edge Computing hardware, means that deployment becomes a possibility for developing countries, where such solutions are needed most",,,AIoT for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,,https://core.ac.uk/download/482691058.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The use of recommendation systems is common in e-commerce websites now-a-days. Since enormous amounts of data including users’ click streams, purchase history, demographics, social networking comments and user-item ratings are stored in e-commerce systems databases, the volume of the data is getting bigger at high speed, and the data is sparse. However, the recommendations and predictions must be made in real time, enabling to bring enormous benefits to human beings. Apache spark is well suited for applications which require high speed query of data, transformation and analytics results. Therefore, the recommendation system developed in this research is implemented on Apache Spark. Also, the matrix factorization using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm which is a type of collaborative filtering is used to solve overfitting issues in sparse data and increases prediction accuracy. The overfitting problem arises in the data as the user-item rating matrix is sparse.

Моделирование рассматривается как метод исследования концептуализированных фрагментов социальной реальности, образующих и формирующих медиасферу – иерархическую гиперсеть, образуемую концептами национальной концептосферы и медиасобытиями. В качестве материала используются 207 обучающих текстовых выборок, каждая из которых посвящена одному медиасобытию, входящему в медиаповестку российских массмедиа за годовой период. The article describes the research program of social reality cognitive-information modeling in mass communication. Modeling in this case is considered as a method to investigate conceptualized fragments of social reality, which form and shape the media sphere. The media sphere appears as a hierarchical hyper network, the lower level of which is constituted by the concepts of the national concept sphere, while the upper levels represent media events along with their various clusters. Media events are not understood as mirror images of social reality phenomena, but rather as modes of their existence for mass audiences. In order to select media events for this study, we considered the current media agenda, which consists of issues with a significant number of reposts of relevant messages by a wide range of sources that reflect different views on specific social events. The study included the implementation of the following steps. (1) Media events were collected, and each of them was presented in the form of a sample of unique texts (publications in the media). The material was collected through the web application “Automated Classifier of News Content”, tagging text messages of users of the social network MirTesen. As a result, 207 training text samples were studied, each of which is devoted to a single media event that is included in the media agenda of the Russian mass media over a year. Within the framework of the supervised machine learning methods, each sample of at least one hundred unique publications in the Russian media was used to create a model of the event. Such models were used for automatic tagging classification of new texts placed on the MirTesen platform (automatic classification revealed the relevance of each created media event model). The total amount of training samples was more than 40,000 media texts; the total number of tagged texts is more than 1 million. (2) Each media event was designated by ten most significant concepts represented in the attributes of its model. The model was built on the basis of mathematical processing of a texts sample. The units (words and word combinations), identified as a result of applying the TF-IDF method and ranked by criterion х2, were regarded as concepts due to the fact that in their system of presenting media events they serve as a knowledge construct that sets the perception and understanding of a given event in the interests of leading actors. (3) The concept hyper-network, representing the national sociopolitical concept sphere, which was formed in the Russian mass media in the studied time period, was reconstructed. In total, there are 1,317 nodes (concepts) and 8,822 edges in the constructed hypernet. (4) Clustering using the hypergraph modularity method and subgraph selection was made. (5) The most significant classes of events were described/interpreted. As a result of the research, a conceptual apparatus has been developed for modeling the media sphere, which combines methods of machine learning, linguistic analysis, network analysis and visual analytics. In this work, the classes of media events were reconstructed, their hierarchy (conceptual priorities) was established, and the relationship between media events was revealed. The most significant classes of media events were the EVENTS (10.48% of the vertices of the hypergraph network), PERSONIFIED POWER (9.79%), UKRAINE (8.5%) and COURT (7.2%). The presented research program can be used to solve client-oriented tasks, starting with monitoring the activity of individual actors and reconstructing their conceptual environment in time dynamics, and ending with monitoring and evaluating the state of the media sphere",,'Tomsk State University',"Сognitive-information modeling of social reality: concepts, events, priorities",10.17223/19986645/72/1,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491013080,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the implementation of an autonomous electric vehicle (EV) project in the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) campus in Taiwan. The aim of this work was to integrate two important practices of realizing an autonomous vehicle in a campus environment, including vehicle positioning and path tracking. Such a project is helpful to the students to learn and practice key technologies of autonomous vehicles conveniently. Therefore, a laboratory-made EV was equipped with real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) to provide centimeter position accuracy. Furthermore, the model predictive control (MPC) was proposed to perform the path tracking capability. Nevertheless, the RTK-GPS exhibited some robust positioning concerns in practical application, such as a low update rate, signal obstruction, signal drift, and network instability. To solve this problem, a multisensory fusion approach using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was utilized to improve the vehicle positioning performance by further considering an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel odometry. On the other hand, the model predictive control (MPC) is usually used to control autonomous EVs. However, the determination of MPC parameters is a challenging task. Hence, reinforcement learning (RL) was utilized to generalize the pre-trained datum value for the determination of MPC parameters in practice. To evaluate the performance of the RL-based MPC, software simulations using MATLAB and a laboratory-made, full-scale electric vehicle were arranged for experiments and validation. In a 199.27 m campus loop path, the estimated travel distance error was 0.82% in terms of UKF. The MPC parameters generated by RL also achieved a better tracking performance with 0.227 m RMSE in path tracking experiments, and they also achieved a better tracking performance when compared to that of human-tuned MPC parameters","[{'title': 'Electronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2079-9292', '2079-9292']}]",'MDPI AG',Integrating Vehicle Positioning and Path Tracking Practices for an Autonomous Vehicle Prototype in Campus Environment,10.3390/electronics10212703,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490592519,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods &amp; Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of &gt; 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",,'PGDesign / Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,,https://core.ac.uk/download/490592519.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
304935586,2018-06-30T22:22:06,"Advanced autonomous robotics space missions rely heavily on the flawless interaction of complex hardware, multiple sensors, and a mission-critical software system.  This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Our Integrated Software Health Management (ISWHM) system continuously monitors the hardware sensors and the software in real-time. The ISWHM uses Bayesian networks, compiled to arithmetic circuits, to model software and hardware interactions. Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.  As our initial demonstration platform, we use a primitive Lego rover. A Lego 
Mindstorms microcontroller is used to implement a highly simplified autonomous rover driving system, running on the OSEK real-time operating system. We demonstrate that our ISWHM, running on this small embedded microcontroller, can perform fault detection as well as on-board reasoning for advanced diagnosis and root-cause detection in real time",Software and System Health Management for Autonomous Robotics Missions,10.1184/r1/6710654.v1,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Though a vast variety of following systems exist, they lack robustness against dynamic changes of the environment and relocating to continue following a lost target. Here we present a robust human following system that has the extendability to commercial service robot platforms having a RGB-D camera. The proposed framework integrates deep learning methods for perception and variational Bayesian techniques for trajectory prediction. Deep learning modules enable robots to accompany a person by detecting the target, learning the target and following while avoiding collision within the dynamic home environment. The variational Bayesian techniques robustly predict the trajectory of the target by empowering the following ability of the robot when target is lost. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the deep Bayesian trajectory prediction method on real-time usage, following abilities, collision avoidance and trajectory prediction of the system. The proposed system was deployed at the RoboCup@Home 2017 Social Standard Platform League and successfully demonstrated its robust functions and smooth person following capability resulting in winning the 1st place.N",Robust Human Following by Deep Bayesian Trajectory Prediction for Home Service Robots,,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1050-4729', '1050-4729']}]",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

395142086,2019-01-29T00:00:00,"[EN] Classification or typology systems used to categorize different human body parts have
existed for many years. Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features.
Ergonomics, forensic anthropology, crime prevention or new human-machine interaction
systems and online activities, like e-commerce, e-learning, games, dating or social networks, are fields in which classifications of facial features are useful, for example, to create
digital interlocutors that optimize the interactions between human and machines. However,
classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported
low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. This
work presents a computer-based procedure to automatically classify facial features based
on their global appearance. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgements from human observers, and facilitates the development of
taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained through this procedure are presented

478629245,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Purpose: This retrospective study analyzes deviations between preoperative planning and postoperative outcome in orthognathic surgery using 2D Onyx Ceph (R) - cephalometric analyzing and planning system. Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients with a mean age 25.1 of years were included in this study. In 33 patients a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and in seven patients a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed. A total of 60 patients were treated by a bimaxillary approach. Onyx Ceph (R) was used as cephalometric planning software (Onyx Ceph (R)), followed by mock operations. Postoperative cephalograms were obtained after 3.3 days and compared to preoperative planning cephalograms for sagittal (SNA, SNB, ANB) and vertical (ArGoMe, ML-NSL, NL-NSL) angle measurements. Real and absolute mean deviation were documented. Results: Absolute mean deviation (degrees) between postoperative and planned jaw movement was lower for the sagittal parameters SNA (0.58), SNB (1.15) and ANB (1.05) compared to the vertical parameters NL-NSL (1.47), ML-NSL (1.96) and ArGoMe (3.20). SNA, SNB and ANB showed constant deviations independent from the extent of jaw movement. With regard to the vertical parameters ML-NSL, ArGoMe and NL-NSL the extent of the postoperative rotational jaw movement was not as much as planned, particularly for vertical shifts of more than 4 degrees. Conclusion: By using the 2D Onyx Ceph (R) cephalometric software for orthognathic surgery, the deviations between planned and actual movements are within an acceptable and predictable range. Planning of extensive vertical alterations may result in greater deviations after surgery. (C) 2018 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

346547471,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring","Deploying acoustic detection algorithms on low-cost, open-source acoustic sensors for environmental monitoring",,,,'MDPI AG',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237173517,2019,"In this paper we investigate the impact of a social robot in the context of serious games in which the robot plays the role of a game opponent by challenging and, at the same time, teaching the child to correctly recycle waste materials. To this aim we performed a study in which we investigated the dimensions that are used to evaluate serious games integrated with those that are typical of the interaction with a social robot. To endow the robot with the capability to play as a game opponent in a real-world context, we implemented an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network so that the robot could detect and classify the waste material as a child would do, by seeing it. After a preliminary evaluation of the approach, we started a formal experiment in which we measured the effectiveness of game design, the robot evaluation and the evaluation of cognitive and affective elements that can form the pro-environmental attitude and then the tendency to recycling. A primary school classroom was involved in the study and, results obtained so far, are encouraging and drew promising possibilities for robotics education in changing recycling attitude for children since Pepper is positively evaluated as trustful and believable and this allowed to be concentrated on the ‘memorization’ task during the game",Investigating the Social Robots’ Role in Improving Children Attitudes toward Recycling.

323114427,2019-12-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the last years different model solutions were proposed for solving cell forces under different conditions. The solution relies on a deformation field that is obtained under cell relaxation with a chemical cocktail. Once the deformation field of the matrix is determined, cell forces can be computed by an inverse algorithm, given the mechanical properties of the matrix. Most of the Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) methods presented so far relied on a linear stress-strain response of the matrix. However, the mechanical response of some biopolymer networks, such as collagen gels is more complex. In this work, we present a numerical method for solving cell forces on non-linear materials. METHODS: The proposed method relies on solving the inverse problem based on an iterative optimization. The objective function is defined by least-square minimization of the difference between the target and the current computed deformed configuration of the cell, and the iterative formulation is based on the solution of several direct mechanical problems. The model presents a well-posed discretized inverse elasticity problem in the absence of regularization. The algorithm can be easily implemented in any kind of Finite Element (FE) code as a sequence of different standard FE analysis. RESULTS: To illustrate the proposed iterative formulation we apply the theoretical model to some illustrative examples by using real experimental data of Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast cells (NHDF) migrating inside a 2 mg/ml collagen-based gel. Different examples of application have been simulated to test the inverse numerical model proposed and to investigate the effect of introducing the correct cell properties onto the obtained cell forces. The algorithm converges after a small number of iterations, generating errors of around 5% for the tractions field in the cell contour domain. The resulting maximum traction values increased by 11% as a consequence of doubling the mechanical properties of the cell domain. CONCLUSIONS: With the results generated from computations we demonstrate the application of the algorithm and explain how the mechanical properties of both, the cell and the gel, domains are important for arriving to the correct results when using inverse traction force reconstruction algorithms, however, have only a minor effect on the resulting traction values.status: accepte",An iterative finite element-based method for solving inverse problems in traction force microscopy,10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105056,,"[{'title': 'Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine', 'identifiers': ['1872-7565', '0169-2607', 'issn:0169-2607', 'issn:1872-7565']}]",'Elsevier BV',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The management of this large inventory of bicycles is a particularly challenging issue with the goal to ensure the demand for bicycles is met at all times across the network. To this end, an efficient scheduling approach is needed with the capacity to guide the redistribution of bicycles across the self-service stations.

Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,,HAL CCSD,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI. 2018;5: 18.We present Oncilla robot, a novel mobile, quadruped legged locomotion machine. This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique potential as research tools to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures, i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom allow tight and swift direction changes, and turns on the spot. Presented hardware experiments are conducted in an open-loop manner, with little control and computational effort. For more versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be included for feedback control with an open communication protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

Such idea data are often used for selection and implementation but, in fact, can 1also be used as sources of inspiration for further idea generation. In particular, the elementary concepts that underlie the original ideas can be recombined to generate new ideas. But it is not a trivial task to retrieve concepts from raw lists of ideas and data sources in a manner that can stimulate or generate new ideas. A significant difficulty lies in the fact that idea data are often expressed in unstructured natural languages. This paper develops a methodology that uses natural language processing to extract key words as elementary concepts embedded in massive idea descriptions and represents the elementary concept space in a core–periphery structure to direct the recombination of elementary concepts into new ideas. We apply the methodology to mine and represent the concept space underlying massive crowdsourced ideas and use it to generate new ideas for future transportation system designs in a real public sector-sponsored project via humans and automated computer programs.

La colorización plantea un reto específico en visión computarizada para la reconstrucción de imágenes y video, tales como, la búsqueda de una fiel aproximación, la saturación correcta de colores escogidos y áreas no desfasadas.
La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
Proponemos el diseño e implementación de una herramienta de restauración de imágenes históricas de la ciudad de Barranquilla realizándoles un coloreado por medio de herramientas de computer vision. Cayena, nuestra aplicación web presenta una galería de imágenes de la historia de Barranquilla y de forma interactiva permite realizarles el coloreado. Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
We propose the design and implementation of a image restoration tool for historical images of the city of Barranquilla by applying a colorization using computer vision techniques. Cayena, our web application displays a gallery of historical images of Barranquilla and interactively allows to colorize them. In order to apply the colorization the application makes a request to our API that hosts the service and executes the colorization process; this colorization process consists in the processing of the image so it has the right size and the verification to make sure it is a grayscale image and transform it if it is not, and the subsequent execution of an pre trained CNN model using the Deep Learning framework ‘Caffe’ which predicts the possible real colors of the image",Automated colorization using Computer Vision tools for restoring historical images of the city of Barranquilla,,,,"Barranquilla, Universidad del Norte, 2020",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells. Hence, the IncuCyte system and its NeuroTrack module provide an appealing platform for efficient in vitro studies of antifungal compounds and immunotherapeu-tic strategies in medical mycology.openWurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P.Wurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P","Live monitoring and analysis of fungal growth, viability, and mycelial morphology using the incucyte neurotrack processing module",10.1128/mBio.00673-19,https://core.ac.uk/download/233571269.pdf,,'American Society for Microbiology',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied
to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir computing (RC) provides
efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of

Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classifiers based on
a standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of
fully trainable neural networks. In this article, we introduce the
reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on RC
to learn vectorial representations of MTS. Each MTS is encoded
within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a
low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared
with other RC methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance due to
an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second
contribution, we propose a modular RC framework for MTS
classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The
framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement
advanced RC architectures. The architectures are compared with
other MTS classifiers, including deep learning models and time

In addition, social robots have been used effectively in educational settings to engage children in the learning process. Following this trend, we designed a serious game in which the social robot Pepper plays with a child to teach him to correctly recycle the materials. To endow the robot with the capability of detecting and classifying the waste material we developed an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network.

A common approach in phishing is through the use of e-mail communication with an embedded hyperlink. The detection and mitigation of phishing attacks are a grand challenge due to the complexity of current phishing attacks. Existing techniques are often too time consuming to be used in the real world in terms of detection and mitigation time. Likewise, they employ static detection rules that are not effective in the real world due to the dynamics of phishing attacks. In this paper, we present PhishLimiter, a new detection and mitigation approach, where we first propose a new technique for deep packet inspection (DPI) and then leverage it with software-defined networking (SDN) to identify phishing activities through e-mail and web-based communication. The proposed DPI approach consists of two components: phishing signature classification and real-time DPI. Based on the programmability of SDN, we develop the store and forward mode and the forward and inspect mode to the direct network traffic by using an artificial neural network model to classify phishing attack signatures and design the real-time DPI so that PhishLimiter can flexibly address the dynamics of phishing attacks in the real world. PhishLimiter also provides better network traffic management for containing phishing attacks since it has the global view of a network through SDN. Furthermore, we evaluate PhishLimiter using a real-world testbed environment and data sets consisting of real-world email with embedded links.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation.

However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city\u27s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring",A sentiment reporting framework for major city events: Case study on the China-United States trade war,,,,'Sociological Research Online',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As a result of this experimental study, it is aimed that shed light on the much-concerned query which face detection tool provides the best performance?. In addition to that, this study succeeds in showing that convolutional neural networks achieve great accuracy for face detection.WOS:00053578850000",An Experimental Performance Comparison of Widely Used Face Detection Tools,10.14201/ADCAIJ201983512,,"[{'title': 'ADCAIJ ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOURNAL', 'identifiers': ['issn:2255-2863', '2255-2863']}]",'Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389599128,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Induction heating has become the reference technology for domestic heating applications due to its benefits in terms of performance, efficiency and safety, among others. In this context, recent design trends aim at providing highly flexible cooking surfaces composed of multi-coil structures. As in many other wireless power transfer systems, one of the main challenges to face is the proper detection of the magnetic coupling with the induction heating load in order to provide improved thermal performance and safe power electronic converter operation. This is specially challenging due to the high variability in the materials used in cookware as well as the random pot placement in flexible induction heating appliances. This paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques in order to provide accurate area overlap estimation regardless of the used pot and its position. An experimental test-bench composed of a complete power converter, multi-coil system and real-Time measurement system has been implemented and used in this study to characterize the parameter variation with overlapped area. Convolutional neural networks are then proposed as an effective method to estimate the covered area, and several implementations are studied and compared according to their computational cost and accuracy. As a conclusion, the presented deep learning-based technique is proposed as an effective tool to estimate the magnetic coupling between the coil and the induction heating load in advanced induction heating appliances",Deep Learning-Based Magnetic Coupling Detection for Advanced Induction Heating Appliances,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960109,https://core.ac.uk/download/389599128.pdf,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322656801,2020-03-01T00:00:00,"[EN] In any water utility, a reliable assessment of the service life of the network pipes is a key piece within the big puzzle of assets management. This paper presents a new statistical model (basic pipes life assessment, BPLA) to assess the service life of pipes, to locate the pipes on the failures bath curve and to forecast the expected failures in future years. Its main novelties are the processing of pipe information (is that information what is adapted to the classical maintenance engineering and not the other way back) and the definition of two different time variables that can be analyzed in parallel. The first novelty makes the model less demanding in terms of data and software tools than others currently available, and the second one allows to get all the results after one single stage of calculation. To show its usability, the BPLA has been applied to a pipe network that supplies water to 500,000 citizens for which two years of failure records are available. Procedures and results have been compared to the well-known Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM), with final relative errors lower than 10% and 15% on each particular result.The authors would like to thank Global Omnium for the support provided, both directly and through the Catedra Aguas de Valencia of the UPV, for the development of the works presented in this paper.Ramírez-Aguilar, RX.; López Jiménez, PA.; Torres Toro, D.; Cobacho Jordán, R.

322656794,2019-10-20T00:00:00,"[EN] Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

322656792,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Epidemiology-based models have shown to have successful adaptations to deal with challenges coming from various areas of Engineering, such as those related to energy use or asset management. This paper deals with urban water demand, and data analysis is based on an Epidemiology tool-set herein developed. This combination represents a novel framework in urban hydraulics. Specifically, various reduction tools for time series analyses based on a symbolic approximate (SAX) coding technique able to deal with simple versions of data sets are presented. Then, a neural-network-based model that uses SAX-based knowledge-generation from various time series is shown to improve forecasting abilities. This knowledge is produced by identifying water distribution district metered areas of high similarity to a given target area and sharing demand patterns with the latter. The proposal has been tested with databases from a Brazilian water utility, providing key knowledge for improving water management and hydraulic operation of the distribution system. This novel analysis framework shows several benefits in terms of accuracy and performance of neural network models for water demand.Navarrete-López, CF.; Herrera Fernández, AM.; Brentan, BM.; Luvizotto Jr., E.; Izquierdo Sebastián, J.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

523156438,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The adoption of fast-paced practices for developing virtual network functions (VNFs) allows for continuous software delivery and creates a market advantage for network operators. This adoption, however, is problematic for testing engineers that need to assure, in shorter development cycles, certain quality of highly-configurable product releases running on heterogeneous clouds. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate testing workflows by detecting performance issues in new software builds. However, the overhead of maintaining several models for all combinations of build types, network configurations, and other stack parameters, can quickly become prohibitive and make the application of ML infeasible.



We propose Env2Vec, a deep learning architecture that combines contextual features with historical resource usage, and characterizes the various stack parameters that influence the test execution within an embedding space, which allows it to generalize model predictions to previously unseen environments. We integrate a single ML model in the testing workflow to automatically debug errors and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. Results obtained with real testing data show an accuracy between 86.2%-100%, while reducing the false alarm rate by 20.9%-38.1% when reporting performance issues compared to state-of-the-art approaches",Env2Vec: accelerating VNF testing with deep learning,10.1145/3342195.3387525,https://core.ac.uk/download/523156438.pdf,,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

288570495,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Performing multi-objective optimization under uncertainty is a common requirement in industries and academia. Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has access to behavioral data for the uncertain parameters. However, solutions of RO may be far from the real solution and less reliable due to inability to map the uncertain space accurately, especially when the data appears discontinuous and scattered in the uncertain domain. Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study. Considered case-studies include highly nonlinear model for continuous casting process from steelmaking industries, where a multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is solved to balance the conflict between productivity and energy consumption. The Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting RO problem are obtained through Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, and ∼23 – 29% improvement is observed in the objective functions. Further, the spread and diversity metrics are enhanced by ∼10 – 95% as compared to those obtained using other standard uncertainty sets",Towards Efficient Robust Optimization using Data based Optimal Segmentation of Uncertain Space,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106821,,,'Elsevier BV',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In addition, sorghum cultivation is economically profitable and it does not contain the proteins that affect celiac patients. In the last years, a variety of ""free gluten"" food products were developed for improving the celiac diet, as well as sorghum beers, which are frequently produced in a home-made manner on a very small scale by individual brewers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a non-alcoholic beverage from sorghum. In this work, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a batch plant for producing malt drink from sorghum at industrial level is proposed. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear problem, which is implemented and solved in GAMS using the CPLEX solver. Through experimental results, design and operation model parameters are obtained in order to develop real-fit formulation. The investment cost is minimized, and a technical-social-economical analysis is presented in order to evaluate the more profitable and sustainable option to produce malt drink from sorghum.

Specifically, our aim is to build a deep neural network based model which is able to predict the popularity of fashion-related images. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are the two major tools to construct the model architecture, in which the CNN is responsible for analyzing images and the MLP is responsible for analyzing other types of social network meta data. Based on this general idea, various tentative model structures are proposed, implemented, and compared in this research. To perform experiments, we constructed a fashion-related dataset which contains over 1 million records from the online social network. Though no real word prediction task has been tried yet, according to the result of dataset-based tests, our models demonstrate good abilities on predicting the popularity of fashion from the online social network using the Xception CNN.

232211197,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are widely used in machine learning and optimization. This paper proposes a time-dependent genetic algorithm (TDGA) based on real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) to improve the convergence performance of functions over time such as a foot trajectory. TDGA has several distinguishing features when compared with traditional RCGA. First, individuals are arranged over time, and then the individuals are optimized in sequence. Second, search spaces of design variables are newly comprised of processes of reductions for search spaces. Third, the search space for crossover operations is expanded to avoid local minima traps that can occur in new search spaces up to the previous search space before performing any reduction of search space, and boundary mutation operation is performed to the new search spaces. Computer simulations are implemented to verify the convergence performance of the robot locomotion optimized by TDGA. Then, TDGA optimizes the desired feet trajectories of quadruped robots that climb up a slope and the impedance parameters of admittance control so that quadruped robots can trot stably over irregular terrains. Simulation results clearly represent that the convergence performance is improved by TDGA, which also shows that TDGA could be broadly used in robot locomotion research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures.

211049053,2019-04-05T00:00:00,"Autonomic optical transmission and networking requires machine learning (ML) models to be trained with large datasets. However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies. Different approaches are analyzed and evaluated for a use case of autonomic transmission, where results show the significant benefits of collective learning.Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version",Learning life cycle to speed up autonomic optical transmission and networking adoption,10.1364/JOCN.11.000226,https://core.ac.uk/download/211049053.pdf,"[{'title': 'Journal of Optical Communications and Networking', 'identifiers': ['1943-0620', 'issn:1943-0620']}]",'The Optical Society',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The first approach is based upon static optimisation of production demand, i.e. exact or heuristic algorithms are used to plan and optimise the assignment of orders to individual machines. In the second scenario, we use real-time situational awareness – implemented as digital avatar – to assign local intelligence to jobs and raw materials in order to compare the results to the traditional planning methods of scenario one.

METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing.

Highlighted, that the interpretation of traditions played a key role in the process of building of Ukrainian statehood during events of 2010–2013 years. In chronicles of Ukrainian events, which were harbingered by Euromaidan, gender markers of violence had been identified. Shown, that gender-based violence is inadmissible and is not traditional for Ukraine.

Russian citations are presented without translation in order to preserve the style and originality of concepts. The religious component of Russian informational influence is revealed: redirecting resistance from Ukraine's external enemies into aggression towards their citizens – women. Illuminated, that not just prorussian, but also patriotic forces under the influence of religious sentiment spread aggression against the European gender equality policy. 
It has been proven that ignoring the gender aspects of security leads to destabilization of the community, and not only the security of individual citizens, but also the social stability in general.

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption
and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved
on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection
algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable,
open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an
endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve.
The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring
device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm
addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account
for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed
events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and
frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner
organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network,
a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic
detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue

326826093,2020-05-25T00:00:00,"In this study, a semantic segmentation network is presented to develop an indoor navigation system for a mobile robot. Semantic segmentation can be applied by adopting different techniques, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, in the present work, a residual neural network is implemented by engaging in ResNet-18 transfer learning to distinguish between the floor, which is the navigation free space, and the walls, which are the obstacles. After the learning process, the semantic segmentation floor mask is used to implement indoor navigation and motion calculations for the autonomous mobile robot. This motion calculations are based on how much the estimated path differs from the center vertical line. The highest point is used to move the motors toward that direction. In this way, the robot can move in a real scenario by avoiding different obstacles. Finally, the results are collected by analyzing the motor duty cycle and the neural network execution time to review the robot’s performance. Moreover, a different net comparison is made to determine other architectures’ reaction times and accuracy values.This research was financed by the plant of Mercedes-Benz Vitoria through the PIF program to develop an intelligent production.

First, a large-scale analysis with 628 Macro-cells (Mcells) and 221 Small-cells (Scells) is used to test different algorithms oriented to optimize the network deployment by minimizing delays, balancing the load among the Base Band Unit (BBU) pools, or clustering the Remote Radio Heads (RRH) efficiently to maximize the multiplexing gain. After planning, real-time resource allocation strategies with QoS constraints should be optimized as well. To do so, a realistic small-scale scenario for the metropolitan area is defined by modelling the individual time-variant traffic patterns of 7000 users (UEs)

connected to different services. The distribution of resources among UEs and BBUs is optimized by algorithms, based on a realistic calculation of the UEs Signal to Interference and Noise Ratios (SINRs), that account for the required computational capacity per cell, the QoS constraints and the service priorities.

Results show that even after the optimization, there are some time intervals where the allocated resources are underutilized, which opens the door to the definition of new Machine Learning algorithms able to predict the required capacity.This work has been funded by the Spanish ministry of science through the project RTI2018-099880-B-C32 and with ERFD funds.

The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection.

There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows.

480281567,2020-07-01T00:00:00,"Web Service registries have progressively evolved to social networks-like software repositories. Users cooperate to produce an ever-growing, rich source of Web APIs upon which new value-added Web applications can be built. Such users often interact in order to follow, comment on, consume and compose services published by other users. In this context, Web Service discovery is a core functionality of modern registries as needed Web Services must be discovered before being consumed or composed. Many efforts to provide effective keyword-based service discovery mechanisms are based on Information Retrieval techniques as services are described using structured or unstructured textdocuments that specify the provided functionality. However, traditional techniques suffer from term-mismatch, which means that only the terms that are contained in both user queries and descriptions are exploited to perform service retrieval. Early feature learning techniques such as LSA or LDA tried to solve this problem by finding hidden or latent features in text documents. Recently, alternative feature learning based techniques such as Word Embeddings achieved state of the art results for Web Service discovery. In this paper, we propose to learn features from service descriptions by using Variational Autoencoders, a special kind of autoencoder which restricts the encoded representation to model latent variables. Autoencoders in turn are deep neural networks used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings. We train our autoencoder using a real 17 113-service dataset extracted from the ProgrammableWeb.com API social repository. We measure discovery efficacy by using both Recall and Precision metrics, achieving significant gains compared to both Word Embeddings and classic latent features modelling techniques. Also, performance-oriented experiments show that the proposed approach can be readily exploited in practice.Fil: Lizarralde, Ignacio. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

iterative, but certain modules such as the collision-checking procedure can be parallelized providing significant speedup with respect to sequential
implementations. In this paper, the RRT and RRT* algorithms have been adapted to a bioinspired computational framework called Membrane
Computing whose models of computation, a.k.a. P systems, run in a non-deterministic and massively parallel way. A large number of robotic
applications are currently using a variant of P systems called Enzymatic Numerical P systems (ENPS) for reactive controlling, but there is a lack
of solutions for motion planning in the framework. The novel models in this work have been designed using the ENPS framework. In order to test

This paper discusses how an ""open science"" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. 

SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets.

Recent developments based on the concept of Industry 4.0 such as big data, new communication protocols and artificial intelligence provide several new avenues to explore. In the specific context of machining, we are working toward the development of a system capable of making the prognostic of the quality (in terms of dimensional conformance) of a workpiece in real time while it is being manufactured. The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms. In the end, this paper depicts the system architecture as well as its interactions between the multiple systems and software already in place at our industrial partner. This paper also shows preliminary results describing the relationship between the workpiece quality (in terms of respect toward the dimensional requirements) and the extracted features from the sensors signals.

429121482,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Background and objective: As Computed Tomography scans are an essential medical test, many techniques have been proposed to reconstruct high-quality images using a smaller amount of radiation. One approach is to employ algebraic factorization methods to reconstruct the images, using fewer views than the traditional analytical methods. However, their main drawback is the high computational cost and hence the time needed to obtain the images, which is critical in the daily clinical practice. For this reason, faster methods for solving this problem are required.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the QR factorization that is very efficient on affordable equipment (standard multicore processors and standard Solid-State Drives) by using Out-Of-Core techniques.

Results: Combining both affordable hardware and the new software proposed in our work, the images can be reconstructed very quickly and with high quality. We analyze the reconstructions using real Computed Tomography images selected from a dataset, comparing the QR method to the LSQR and FBP. We measure the quality of the images using the metrics Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, obtaining very high values. We also compare the efficiency of using spinning disks versus Solid-State Drives, showing how the latter performs the Input/Output operations in a significantly lower amount of time. Conclusions: The results indicate that our proposed me thod and software are valid to efficiently solve large-scale systems and can be applied to the Computed Tomography reconstruction problem to obtain high-quality images.This research has been supported by ""Universitat Politecnica de Valencia"", ""Generalitat Valenciana"" under PROMETEO/2018/035 and ACIF/2017/075, co-financed by FEDER and FSE funds, and the ""Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities"" under Grant RTI2018-098156-B-C54 co-financed by FEDER funds.Chillarón-Pérez, M.; Quintana Ortí, G.; Vidal-Gimeno, V.; Verdú Martín, GJ.

304117829,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Deep Learning is increasingly being adopted by industry for computer vision applications running on embedded devices. While Convolutional Neural Networks' accuracy has achieved a mature and remarkable state, inference latency and throughput are a major concern especially when targeting low-cost and low-power embedded platforms. CNNs' inference latency may become a bottleneck for Deep Learning adoption by industry, as it is a crucial specification for many real-time processes. Furthermore, deployment of CNNs across heterogeneous platforms presents major compatibility issues due to vendor-specific technology and acceleration libraries.In this work, we present QS-DNN, a fully automatic search based on Reinforcement Learning which, combined with an inference engine optimizer, efficiently explores through the design space and empirically finds the optimal combinations of libraries and primitives to speed up the inference of CNNs on heterogeneous embedded devices. We show that, an optimized combination can achieve 45x speedup in inference latency on CPU compared to a dependency-free baseline and 2x on average on GPGPU compared to the best vendor library. Further, we demonstrate that, the quality of results and time ""to-solution"" is much better than with Random Search and achieves up to 15x better results for a short-time search",Learning to infer: RL-based search for DNN primitive selection on Heterogeneous Embedded Systems,10.23919/DATE.2019.8714959,https://core.ac.uk/download/304117829.pdf,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R). The work of Patricia Pons is supported by a national grant from the Spanish MECD (FPU13/03831).

287866167,2020-12-01T00:00:00,"A video game is an interactive software able to arouse intense emotions in players. Consequentially, different theories have been proposed to understand which game aspects are able to affect the players\u2019 emotional state. However, only few works have tried to use empirical evidence to investigate the effects of different game aspects of the players\u2019 emotions. In this paper, we present the results of a set of experiments aimed at predicting the players\u2019 emotions during video games sessions using their physiological data. We have created a physiological dataset from the data acquired by 33 participants during video game fruition using a standard monitor and a Virtual Reality headset. The dataset contains information about electrocardiogram, 5 facials electromyographies, electrodermal activity, and respiration. Furthermore, we have asked the players to self-assess their emotional state on the Arousal and Valence space. We have then analyzed the contribution of each physiological signal to the overall definition of the players\u2019 mental state. Finally, we have applied Machine Learning techniques to predict the emotional state of players during game sessions at a precision of one second. The obtained results can contribute to define game devices and engines able to detect physiological data, as well to improve the game design process",An empirical study of players&#8217; emotions in VR racing games based on a dataset of physiological data,10.1007/s11042-019-08585-y,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

441907616,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"Background and Aim: In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in poultry are still reported. The disease causes a decrease in egg production and an increase in mortality; this has an impact on the economic losses of farmers. Several studies have considered that ducks play a role in the HPAI endemicity in the country; however, little is known about whether or not the type of duck farming is associated with HPAI H5 virus infection, particularly within clade 2.3.2.1c, which has been predominantly found in poultry since 2014. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the HPAI seroprevalence for H5 subtype clade 2.3.2.1c in laying ducks that are kept intensively and nomadically and to determine the associated risk factors.



Materials and Methods: Forty-nine duck farmers were randomly selected from ten sub-districts in Purbalingga District, Central Java, Indonesia; a cross-sectional study was implemented to collect field data. Based on an expected HPAI prevalence level of 10%, estimated accuracy of ± 5%, and 95% confidence interval (CI), the total sample size was calculated at 36 individuals. Samples must be multiplied by 7 to reduce bias; thus, 252 ducks were taken as samples in this study. Considering that the maintenance and duck handling were uniform and farmers complained that the effect of activity to take duck samples would reduce egg production, this study only took samples from 245 ducks (oropharyngeal swabs and serum). Those samples were taken from five birds on each farm. Hemagglutination inhibition tests examined the serum samples for HPAI H5 Clade 2.3.2.1c, and pool swab samples (five swabs in one viral media transport) were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test for influenza Type A and H5 subtype virus. Information regarding farm management was obtained using a questionnaire; face-to-face interviews were conducted with the duck farmers using native Javanese language.



Results: Serum and swabs from 245 ducks were collected in total. For individual birds, 54.69% (134/245) of serum samples were H5 seropositive. Seroprevalence among nomadic ducks was 59.28% (95% CI: 0.48-0.61), which was higher than among intensively farmed ducks (48.57%, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58). Farm-level seroprevalence was 50% (95% CI: 0.30-0.69) for nomadic ducks but only 28.57% (95% CI: 0.11-0.51) for intensively farmed ducks. The farm-level virus prevalence (proportion of flocks with at least one bird positive for influenza Type A) was 17.85% (95% CI: 0.07-0.35) for nomadic ducks and 4.76% (1/21) for intensively farmed ducks (95% CI: 0.008-0.23). All influenza Type A positive samples were negative for the H5 subtype, indicating that another HA subtype AI viruses might have been circulating in ducks in the study area. A relationship between duck farms that were H5 seropositive and their maintenance system was present; however, this relationship was not significant, the nomadic duck system detected 2 times higher H5-seropositive ducks than the intensive farming system (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 0.33-14.31).



Conclusion: This study found that the seroprevalence of HPAI in the duck population level in Purbalingga was 54.69% and demonstrated that the nomadic duck farming system was more likely to acquire HPAI H5 infection than the intensive farming duck system. Other risk factors should be further investigated as the diversity of the farming system is partially related to HPAI H5 infection","Determining highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza clade 2.3.2.1c seroprevalence in ducks, Purbalingga, Central Java, Indonesia",10.14202/vetworld.2020.1138-1144,https://core.ac.uk/download/441907616.pdf,"[{'title': 'Veterinary World', 'identifiers': ['issn:2231-0916', '2231-0916', 'issn:0972-8988', '0972-8988']}]",'Veterinary World',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
483665146,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An image is worth a thousand words; hence, a face image illustrates extensive details about the speciﬁcation, gender, age, and emotional states of mind. Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human–computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one ﬁnds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The ﬁrst branch explores geo-metric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the ﬁnal classiﬁca-tion score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on ﬁve benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The data-bases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

343215263,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Classification of multivariate time series (MTS) has
been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied
to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir computing (RC) provides
efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of
the MTS that can be further processed by standard classifiers.
Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classifiers based on
a standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of
fully trainable neural networks. In this article, we introduce the
reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on RC
to learn vectorial representations of MTS. Each MTS is encoded
within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a
low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared
with other RC methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance due to
an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second
contribution, we propose a modular RC framework for MTS
classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The
framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement
advanced RC architectures. The architectures are compared with
other MTS classifiers, including deep learning models and time
series kernels. Results obtained on the benchmark and real-world
MTS data sets show that RC classifiers are dramatically faster
and, when implemented using our proposed representation, also
achieve superior classification accurac",Reservoir computing approaches for representation and classification of multivariate time series,10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3001377,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems', 'identifiers': ['2162-2388', 'issn:2162-237X', 'issn:2162-2388', '2162-237x']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Sin embargo, los ecosistemas de bosques secos en Ecuador están en peligro de convertirse en una fuente de emisiones de carbono debido a la deforestación. A menudo falta información espacial, necesaria para cuantificar la pérdida potencial de carbono a la atmósfera. Esto se aplica particularmente a áreas remotas de accesibilidad limitada. Este estudio tiene como objetivo regionalizar las reservas de COS de un ecosistema de bosque seco pequeño y poco accesible en el suroeste de Ecuador mediante el uso de modelos de árbol de regresión reforzado (BRT). El nuevo muestreo en un enfoque de validación cruzada repetida anidada se aplicó para desarrollar modelos robustos para un conjunto de datos de 118 muestras con información predictiva limitada. Para seleccionar un conjunto óptimo de parámetros del modelo, se aplicó la optimización por evolución diferencial (DE) para el ajuste de parámetros. La selección de predictores se implementó utilizando el mismo algoritmo de optimización. Este estudio demuestra cómo se puede mejorar el rendimiento predictivo de los modelos BRT mediante la aplicación de un enfoque de optimización para el ajuste de parámetros y la selección de predictores. El rendimiento del modelo se mejoró en aproximadamente un 40% con respecto al R2. Aún así, los resultados también demostraron las dificultades de las aplicaciones de aprendizaje automático en áreas naturales pequeñas y altamente heterogéneas. Se asumió que factores muy variables o incluso aleatorios distorsionan la relación entre las variables predictoras y de respuesta. Suponemos que el enfoque presentado es particularmente exitoso en el caso de un espacio de parámetros de sintonización multivariado de valor real. Sin embargo, esto requiere pruebas en otras aplicaciones y algoritmos de aprendizaje automático.Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration plays a key role in reducing the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. However, dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador are endangered to become a source of carbon emissions because of deforestation. Often spatial information, necessary to quantify potential carbon loss to the atmosphere, is missing. This particularly applies to remote areas of limited accessibility. This study aims to regionalise the SOC stocks of a small and poorly accessible dry forest ecosystem in southwestern Ecuador by using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Resampling in a nested repeated k-fold cross validation approach was applied to develop robust models for a dataset of 118 samples with limited predictor information. To select an optimal set of model parameters, optimisation by differential evolution (DE) was applied for parameter tuning. Predictor selection was implemented using the same optimisation algorithm. This study demonstrates how the predictive performance of BRT models can be improved by applying an optimisation approach for parameter tuning and predictor selection. Model performance was improved by approximately 40% concerning the R2. Still, the results also demonstrated the difficulties of machine learning applications in small and highly heterogeneous natural areas. Very variable or even random factors were assumed to distort the relationship between predictor and response variables. We assume that the presented approach is particularly successful in the case of a real-valued multivariate space of tuning parameters. However, this requires testing in further machine learning applications and algorithms",Optimisation in machine learning: an application to topsoil organic stocks prediction in a dry forest ecosystem,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.07.004,,"[{'title': 'Geoderma', 'identifiers': ['0016-7061', 'issn:0016-7061']}]",'Elsevier BV',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The gradient non-linearity (GNL) induced distortions in MRI; however, hinder the implementation of MRI-Linac system in image-guided radiotherapy where highly accurate geometry and anatomy of the target tumour is indispensable.To correct the geometric distortions in MR images, in particular, for the 1 Tesla (T) MRI-Linac system, a deep fully-connected neural network was proposed to automatically learn the intricate relationship between the undistorted (theoretical) and distorted (real) space. A data set, consisting of spatial samples acquired by phantom measurement that covers both inside and outside the working diameter of spherical volume (DSV), was utilised for training the neural network; which offers the ability to describe subtle deviations of the GNL field within the entire region of interest (ROI).The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MR images of a three-dimensional (3D) phantom and the pelvic region of an adult volunteer scanned in the 1T MRI-Linac system. The experimental results showed that the severe geometric distortions within the entire ROI had been successfully corrected with an error less than the pixel size. Also, the presented network is highly efficient, which achieved significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to existing methods.The feasibility of the presented deep neural network for characterising the GNL field deviations in the 1T MRI-Linac system was demonstrated in this study, which shows promise in facilitating the MRI-Linac system to be routinely implemented in real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy",Fast geometric distortion correction using a deep neural network: implementation for the 1 Tesla MRI-Linac system,10.1002/mp.14382,,,'Wiley',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
301275242,2019-04-05T00:00:00,"Autonomic optical transmission and networking requires machine learning (ML) models to be trained with large datasets. However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies.

WODAN2.0 is developed to rapidly and systematically map archaeology in large and complex datasets. To investigate its practical value, a large, random test dataset—next to a small, non-random dataset—was developed, which better represents the real-world situation of scarce archaeological objects in different types of complex terrain. To reduce the number of false positives caused by specific regions in the research area, a novel approach has been developed and implemented called Location-Based Ranking. Experiments show that WODAN2.0 has a performance of circa 70% for barrows and Celtic fields on the small, non-random testing dataset, while the performance on the large, random testing dataset is lower: circa 50% for barrows, circa 46% for Celtic fields, and circa 18% for charcoal kilns. The results show that the introduction of Location-Based Ranking and bagging leads to an improvement in performance varying between 17% and 35%.

In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement.This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program as part of the ACTIVAGE project under Grant 732679.Sarabia-Jácome, D.; Usach, R.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

304935586,2018-06-30T22:22:06,"Advanced autonomous robotics space missions rely heavily on the flawless interaction of complex hardware, multiple sensors, and a mission-critical software system.  This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Our Integrated Software Health Management (ISWHM) system continuously monitors the hardware sensors and the software in real-time. The ISWHM uses Bayesian networks, compiled to arithmetic circuits, to model software and hardware interactions. Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.  As our initial demonstration platform, we use a primitive Lego rover. A Lego 
Mindstorms microcontroller is used to implement a highly simplified autonomous rover driving system, running on the OSEK real-time operating system. We demonstrate that our ISWHM, running on this small embedded microcontroller, can perform fault detection as well as on-board reasoning for advanced diagnosis and root-cause detection in real time",Software and System Health Management for Autonomous Robotics Missions,10.1184/r1/6710654.v1,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Here we present a robust human following system that has the extendability to commercial service robot platforms having a RGB-D camera. The proposed framework integrates deep learning methods for perception and variational Bayesian techniques for trajectory prediction. Deep learning modules enable robots to accompany a person by detecting the target, learning the target and following while avoiding collision within the dynamic home environment. The variational Bayesian techniques robustly predict the trajectory of the target by empowering the following ability of the robot when target is lost. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the deep Bayesian trajectory prediction method on real-time usage, following abilities, collision avoidance and trajectory prediction of the system.

478629245,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Purpose: This retrospective study analyzes deviations between preoperative planning and postoperative outcome in orthognathic surgery using 2D Onyx Ceph (R) - cephalometric analyzing and planning system. Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients with a mean age 25.1 of years were included in this study. In 33 patients a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and in seven patients a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed. A total of 60 patients were treated by a bimaxillary approach. Onyx Ceph (R) was used as cephalometric planning software (Onyx Ceph (R)), followed by mock operations. Postoperative cephalograms were obtained after 3.3 days and compared to preoperative planning cephalograms for sagittal (SNA, SNB, ANB) and vertical (ArGoMe, ML-NSL, NL-NSL) angle measurements. Real and absolute mean deviation were documented. Results: Absolute mean deviation (degrees) between postoperative and planned jaw movement was lower for the sagittal parameters SNA (0.58), SNB (1.15) and ANB (1.05) compared to the vertical parameters NL-NSL (1.47), ML-NSL (1.96) and ArGoMe (3.20). SNA, SNB and ANB showed constant deviations independent from the extent of jaw movement. With regard to the vertical parameters ML-NSL, ArGoMe and NL-NSL the extent of the postoperative rotational jaw movement was not as much as planned, particularly for vertical shifts of more than 4 degrees. Conclusion: By using the 2D Onyx Ceph (R) cephalometric software for orthognathic surgery, the deviations between planned and actual movements are within an acceptable and predictable range. Planning of extensive vertical alterations may result in greater deviations after surgery. (C) 2018 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

202096241,2016-06-01T00:00:00,"Introduction/ Background
Liver steatosis is very important in transplantation pathology as it directly influences the graft dysfunction. Pretransplant donor biopsy materials are evaluated by the pathologists, and degree of steatosis, especially large droplet steatosis (LDS) which is described as lipid droplets with a diameter of at least 15 micron, is estimated under light microscope. But when doing so, there can be great intra- and inter-observer variability. In order to overcome this problem several automated systems and image analysis methods are used.
Aims
The most challenging issue for automated steatosis image analysis is to distinguish real oil droplets from sinusoidal regions. Although some morphometric features are employed to make this discrimination, whole feature space could not be represented for a fatty liver cell. In this study we have contributed a new approach, which tries to solve this discrimination issue with an artificial learning system.
Methods
Ten consecutive hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained, formalin fixed paraffin embedded donor liver biopsies, reported by 2 pathologist, were evaluated by a third pathologist and steatosis percentage was given as total and LDS by using the percentage of area occupied by lipid droplets to total biopsy area. Automated image analysis was performed on about 200 photographs taken to represent the whole biopsy at X20 magnification by Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 microscope using Kameram™ software and established as percentage of LDS to total biopsy area. Segmented positive (oil) and negative (non- oil) components are labeled by an expert pathologist and after some preprocesses they are fed to an Artificial Neural Network for training. We have used about 1000 droplets for training and 1500 droplets for performance evaluation. The proposed scheme is utilized to calculate liver fat ratio on digital images and the results are compared with expert’s opinions.
Results
There was great variation among pathologists and when compared to the automated analysis and pathologists were prone to overestimate the steatosis (Table 1). As this overestimation can lead to nonuse of the donor liver, the accurate assessment of the steatosis is critical. Since the biopsy is the gold standard for the assessment of steatosis, methodology of this examination should be as objective as possible. Our results show that automated assessment of liver steatosis is very useful in order not to loose donor livers, by overestimation. Automated image analysis used before were based on morphometric features of liver droplet regions, and use

Real Logic is a framework where learning from numerical data and logical reasoning are integrated using first order logic syntax. The symbols of the signature of Real Logic are interpreted in the data-space, i.e, on the domain of real numbers. The integration of learning and reasoning obtained in Real Logic allows us to formalize learning as approximate satisfiability in the presence of logical constraints, and to perform inference on symbolic and numerical data. After introducing a refined version of the formalism, we describe its implementation into Logic Tensor Networks which uses deep learning within Google's Tensorflow. We evaluate LTN on the task of classifying objects and their parts in images, where we combine state-of-the-art-object detectors with a part-of ontology. LTN outperforms the state-of-the-art on object classification, and improves the performances on part-of relation detection with respect to a rule-based baseline.Luciano Serafini; Ivan Donadello; Artur d'Avila GarcezSerafini, Luciano; Donadello, Ivan; Artur d'Avila, Garce",Learning and Reasoning in Logic Tensor Networks: Theory and Application to Semantic Image Interpretation,10.1145/3019612.3019642,,,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
29723989,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"The MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) instrument on the Envisat (Environmental satellite) satellite has provided vertical profiles of the atmospheric composition on a global scale for almost ten years. The MIPAS mission is divided in two phases: the full resolution phase, from 2002 to 2004, and the optimized resolution phase, from 2005 to 2012, which is characterized by a finer vertical and horizontal sampling attained through a reduction of the spectral resolution.  While the description and characterization of the products of the ESA processor for the full resolution phase has been already described in previous papers, in this paper we focus on the performances of the latest version of the ESA (European Space Agency) processor, named ML2PP V6 (MIPAS Level 2 Prototype Processor), which has been used for reprocessing the entire mission. The ESA processor had to perform the operational near real time analysis of the observations and its products needed to be available for data assimilation. Therefore, it has been designed for fast, continuous and automated analysis of observations made in quite different atmospheric conditions and for a minimum use of external constraints in order to avoid biases in the products.  The dense vertical sampling of the measurements adopted in the second phase of the MIPAS mission resulted in sampling intervals finer than the instantaneous field of view of the instrument. Together with the choice of a retrieval grid aligned with the vertical sampling of the measurements, this made ill-conditioned the retrieval problem of the MIPAS operational processor. This problem has been handled with minimal changes to the original retrieval approach but with significant improvements nonetheless. The Levenberg-Marquardt method, already present in the retrieval scheme for its capability to provide fast convergence for nonlinear problems, is now also exploited for the reduction of the ill-conditioning of the inversion. An expression specifically designed for the regularizing Levenberg-Marquardt method has been implemented for the computation of the covariance matrices and averaging kernels of the retrieved products. The regularization of the Levenberg-Marquardt method is controlled by the convergence criteria and is deliberately kept weak. The resulting oscillations of the retrieved profile are a posteriori damped by an innovative self-adapting Tikhonov regularization. The convergence criteria and the weakness of the self-adapting regularization ensure that minimum constraints are used and the best vertical resolution obtainable from the measurements is achieved in all atmospheric conditions.  Random and systematic errors, as well as vertical and horizontal resolution are compared in the two phases of the mission for all products, namely: temperature, H2O, O3, HNO3, CH4, N2O, NO2, CFC-11, CFC-12, N2O5 and ClONO2. The use in the two phases of the mission of different optimized sets of spectral intervals ensures that, despite the different spectral resolutions, comparable performances are obtained in the whole MIPAS mission in terms of random and systematic errors, while the vertical resolution and the horizontal resolution are significantly better in the case of the optimized resolution measurements. © Author(s) 2013",Ten years of MIPAS measurements with ESA Level 2 processor V6-Part 1: Retrieval algorithm and diagnostics of the products,,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
417852328,2017-06-01T00:00:00,"A valid model of the air surveillance system performance is highly valued when making decisions related to the optimal control of the system. We formulate a model for a multi-radar tracker system by combining a radar performance model with a tracker performance model. A tracker as a complex software system is hard to model mathematically and physically. Our novel approach is to utilize machine learning to create a tracker model based on measurement data from which the input and target output for the model are calculated. The measured data comprises the time series of 3D coordinates of cooperative aircraft flights, the corresponding target detection recordings from multiple radars, and the related multi-radar track recordings. The collected data is used to calculate performance measures for the radars and the tracker at specific locations in the air space. We apply genetic programming to learning such rules from radar performance measures that explain tracker performance. The easily interpretable rules are intended to reveal the real behavior of the system providing comprehension for its control and further development. The learned rules allow predicting tracker performance level for the system control in all radar geometries, modes, and conditions at any location. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of our approach to learning a tracker model and compare our rule learner with two tree classifiers, another rule learner, a neural network, and an instance-based classifier using the real air surveillance data. The tracker model created by our rule learner outperforms the models by the other methods except for the neural network whose prediction performance is equal.acceptedVersionPeer reviewe",Learning of a tracker model from multi-radar data for performance prediction of air surveillance system,10.1109/CEC.2017.7969562,https://core.ac.uk/download/417852328.pdf,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

80047382,2016-11-01T00:00:00,"Authorship attribution, conceived as the identification of the origin of a text between different authors, has been a very active area of research in the scientific community mainly supported by advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and Computational Intelligence. This paradigm has been mostly addressed from a literary perspective, aiming at identifying the stylometric features and writeprints which unequivocally typify the writer patterns and allow their unique identification. On the other hand, the upsurge of social networking platforms and interactive messaging have undoubtedly made the anonymous expression of feelings, the sharing of experiences and social relationships much easier than in other traditional communication media. Unfortunately, the popularity of such communities and the virtual identification of their users deploy a rich substrate for cybercrimes against unsuspecting victims and other forms of illegal uses of social networks that call for the activity tracing of accounts. In the context of one-to-one communications this manuscript postulates the identification of the sender of a message as a useful approach to detect impersonation attacks in interactive communication scenarios. In particular this work proposes to select linguistic features extracted from messages via NLP techniques by means of a novel feature selection algorithm based on the dissociation between essential traits of the sender and receiver influences. The performance and computational efficiency of different supervised learning models when incorporating the proposed feature selection method is shown to be promising with real SMS data in terms of identification accuracy, and paves the way towards future research lines focused on applying the concept of language typicality in the discourse analysis field.This work has been partially supported by the Basque Government under the ETORTEK (Grant IE14-382) and the ELKARTEK (BID3A project, Grant ref.

Methods: Adiponectin (Adipo), adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1), and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin protein concentration was evaluated by ELISA method. Data were analyzed using Studentâ��s t test and one-way ANOVA in SPSS 21 software. At oocyte retrieval, FF was aspirated and GCs were obtained from a pooled collection of FF per each patient. Results: PCR results showed expression of adiponectin, AdipoR1, AdipoR2, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in GCs. After controlling body mass index (BMI) values, qRT-PCR demonstrated a decreased expression of adiponectin system in GCs of PCOS patients compared to those in controls (p = 0.001). There was a strong positive correlation among AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression and also among FSH and LH receptor expression. (Both r = 0.8, p = 0.001). There were low levels of high molecular weight adiponectin in the serum of PCOS patients with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (30.19 Â± 4.3Â ng/ml) compared to the controls (48.47 Â± 5.9Â ng/ml) and in the FF of PCOS patients with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (7.86 Â± 1.44Â ng/ml) compared to the controls (14.22 Â± 2.01Â ng/ml; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Lower expression of adiponectin and its receptors in GCs might be an important manifestation in gonadotropin-stimulated PCOS patients which could influence the physiologic adiponectin roles such as interaction with insulin and LH in induction of GC gene expression.

attends to the user needs and increases their wellbeing. In this sense, this paper introduces the EJaCalIVE framework which allows
the creation of emotional virtual environments that incorporate agents, eHealth related devices, human actors, and emotions
projecting them virtually and managing the interaction between all the elements. In this way, the proposed framework allows
the design and programming of intelligent virtual environments, as well as the simulation and detection of human emotions which
can be used for the improvement of the decision-making processes of the developed entities. The paper also shows a case study
that enforces the need of this framework in common environments like nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Concretely, the
case study proposes the simulation of a residence for the elderly. The main goal is to have an emotion-based simulation to train an
assistance robot avoiding the complexity involved in working with the real elders. The main advantage of the proposed framework
is to provide a safe environment, that is, an environment where users are able to interact safely with the system.This work is partially supported by the MINECO/FEDER TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R and the FPI Grant AP2013-01276 awarded to Jaime-Andres Rincon.

In this context, the availability of methods for the prediction of the Electrical Load Demand (ELD) is extremely important mainly due to its relevance for an appropriate energy management, sizing of NZEB energy systems, and, especially, for the implementation of suitable energy control strategies, such as energy storage. This paper describes the development and assessment of an electricity demand short-term predictive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for a characteristic laboratory within an NZEB located at Almeria (Southeastern Spain).

To this end, an efficient scheduling approach is needed with the capacity to guide the redistribution of bicycles across the self-service stations.

One key challenge that increases the size of the exploration space is the number of views that one can generate from a single dataset, based on the use of multiple parameter values and exploration paths. Often, no such single view contains all needed insights. The question thus arises of how we can efficiently combine insights from multiple views of a dataset. We propose a set of techniques that considerably reduce the exploration effort for such situations, based on the explicit depiction of the view space, using a small multiple metaphor. We leverage this view space by offering interactive techniques that enable users to explicitly create, visualize, and follow their exploration path. This way, partial insights obtained from each view can be efficiently and effectively combined.

FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI. 2018;5: 18.We present Oncilla robot, a novel mobile, quadruped legged locomotion machine. This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique potential as research tools to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures, i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom allow tight and swift direction changes, and turns on the spot. Presented hardware experiments are conducted in an open-loop manner, with little control and computational effort. For more versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be included for feedback control with an open communication protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion. It trots with a cost of transport of 3.2 J/(Nm),at a speed of 0.63 m s(-1) (Froude number 0.25). The robot trots inclined slopes up to 10 degrees, at 0.25 m s(-1). The multi-body Webots model of Oncilla robot, and Oncilla robot's extensive software architecture enables users to design and test scenarios in simulation. Controllers can directly be transferred to the real robot.

To monitor daily living activities, the use of a temperature, CO2, humidity sensors, and microphones are described in experiments in this study. The first part of the paper describes the use of CO2 concentration measurement for detecting and monitoring room's occupancy in SHC. In second part focuses this paper on the proposal of an implementation of Artificial Neural Network based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) for the detection of human presence in a room of SHC with the use of predictive calculation of CO2 concentrations from obtained measurements of temperature (indoor, outdoor) T-i, T-o and relative air humidity rH. Based on the long-term monitoring (1 month) of operational and technical functions (unregulated, uncontrolled) in an experimental Smart Home (SH), LMA was trained through the data picked up by the sensors of CO2, T and rH with the aim to indirectly predict CO2 leading to the elimination of CO2 sensor from the measurement process. Within the realized experiment, input parameters of the neuronal network and the number of neurons for LMA were optimized on the basis of calculated values of Root Mean Squared Error, the correlative coefficient (R) and the length of the measured training time ANN. With the use of the trained network ANN, we realized a strictly controlled short-term (11 h) experiment without the use of CO2 sensor. Experimental results verified high method accuracy (>95%) within the short-term and long-term experiments for learned ANN (1.6.2015-30.6.2015). For learned ANN (1.2.2014-27.2.2014) was verified worse method accuracy (>60%). The original contribution is a verification of a low-cost method for the detection of human presence in the real operating environment of SHC.

202437912,2016-12-31,"AbstractPerformance debugging using program profiling and tracing for scientific workflows can be extremely difficult for two reasons. 1) Existing performance tools lack the ability to automatically produce global performance data based on local information from coupled scientific applications of workflows, particularly at runtime. 2) Profiling/tracing with static instrumentation may incur high overhead and significantly slow down science-critical tasks. To gain more insights on workflows we introduce a lightweight workflow monitoring infrastructure, WOW-MON (WOrkfloW MONitor), which enables user's access not only to cross-application performance data such as end-to-end latency and execution time of individual workflow components at runtime, but also to customized performance events. To reduce profiling overhead, WOW-MON uses adaptive selection of performance metrics based on machine learning algorithms to guide profilers collecting only metrics that have most impact on performance of workflows. Through the study of real scientific workflows (e.g., LAMMPS) with the help of WOWMON, we found that the performance of the workflows can be significantly affected by both software and hardware factors, such as the policy of process mapping and in-situ buffer size. Moreover, we experimentally show that WOWMON can reduce data movement for profiling by up to 54% without missing the key metrics for performance debugging",WOWMON: A Machine Learning-based Profiler for Self-adaptive Instrumentation of Scientific Workflows ,10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.474,,,The Author(s).

Da un lato la persistente distanza culturale fra le figure umanistiche e quelle tecniche e la difficile realizzazione di un reale approccio interdisciplinare, inteso come effettiva collaborazione biunivoca fra le parti, sulla quale lavorano da molti anni differenti associazioni a livello internazionale (CAA, VSMM, AIC, etc.), porta ad una mancanza di dialogo e di conseguenza alla mancata comprensione delle esigenze in fase analitica, arrivando ad ottenere risultati lacunosi o dati non affidabili ai fini delle ricerche. Dal punto di vista metodologico invece si evidenzia una divergenza sul ruolo e finalità delle tecniche di rilievo e di rappresentazione, siano esse tradizionali o digitali, all’interno del processo conoscitivo del manufatto, che può portare a risultati fini a sé stessi, autoreferenziali e non utili ai fini del raggiungimento di una conoscenza complessa del Bene.

Partendo da una analisi storica sul ruolo del colore nel rilievo e nella rappresentazione dei Beni Archeologici, l’articolo intende suggerire alcune riflessioni di carattere culturale e metodologico, ponendo al centro del confronto il rilievo geometrico e radiometrico come strumento di conoscenza della archeologia, in relazione alle finalità del progetto di rilievo e alla sua relativa rappresentazione. Verranno presentati alcuni casi studio a supporto di tali riflessioni e delle successive conclusioni che ne verranno tratte.The role of color as a cognitive instrument of archeology, deployed within relief and representation, is a theme that covers different disciplines and applications, from the knowledge and evolutionary study of color physics to the history of materials and pigments, from the highlight of the chromatic and material aspects to its representation, till the digital visualization in environments with a level of immersion and increasing interaction. To date, there are many experiments carried out and the results achieved in different application areas, but despite this the relief and color representation are often a bottleneck in the cognitive process of the archeological artifact. This condition is mainly due to two factors, the first of a cultural nature and the second related to methodological origin. On the one hand, the persisting cultural distance between humanistic and technical figures and the difficult realization of a real interdisciplinary approach, understood as effective biunivocal collaboration between the parties on which they have been working internationally for many years (CAA, VSMM, AIC , etc.) leads to a lack of dialogue and consequently to a lack in analytic requirements understanding as well, leading to poor results or unreliable data for research purposes. From the methodological point of view, however, there is a divergence on the role and purpose of the techniques of representation, whether traditional or digital, within the cognitive passage of the article, which can lead to self-referential, self-referential and non-objective results. useful to the achievement of a complex knowledge of the Cultural Heritage artifact.

Starting from an historical analysis of the role of color in the relief and representation of the Archaeological Heritage, the article intends to suggest some cultural and methodological reflections, focusing on geometric and radiometric relief as an instrument of knowledge of archeology, in relation to the purpose of the project and its relative representation. Some case studies will be presented to support such reflections and the subsequent conclusions",Il ruolo del colore nella conoscenza dei Beni Archeologici,,,,Associazione Italiana del Colore,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389872197,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Authorship attribution, conceived as the identification of the origin of a text be- tween different authors, has been a very active area of research in the scientific community mainly supported by advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and Computational Intelligence. This paradigm has been mostly addressed from a literary perspective, aiming at identifying the stylometric fea- tures and writeprints which unequivocally typify the writer patterns and allow their unique identification. On the other hand, the upsurge of social networking platforms and interactive messaging have undoubtedly made the anonymous ex- pression of feelings, the sharing of experiences and social relationships much easier than in other traditional communication media. Unfortunately, the popularity of such communities and the virtual identification of their users deploy a rich sub- strate for cybercrimes against unsuspecting victims and other forms of illegal uses of social networks that call for the activity tracing of accounts. In the context of one- to-one communications this manuscript postulates the identification of the sender of a message as a useful approach to detect impersonation attacks in interactive com- munication scenarios. In particular this work proposes to select linguistic features extracted from messages via NLP techniques by means of a novel feature selec- tion algorithm based on the dissociation between essential traits of the sender and receiver influences. The performance and computational efficiency of different su- pervised learning models when incorporating the proposed feature selection method is shown to be promising with real SMS data in terms of identification accuracy, and paves the way towards future research lines focused on applying the concept of language typicality in the discourse analysis field",A Feature Selection Method for Author Identification in Interactive Communications based on Supervised Learning and Language Typicality,10.1016/j.engappai.2016.09.004,https://core.ac.uk/download/389872197.pdf,"[{'title': 'Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence', 'identifiers': ['issn:0952-1976', '0952-1976']}]",'Elsevier BV',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Alert-brokers-automated software system to sift through, characterize, annotate, and prioritize events for follow-up-will be critical tools for managing alert streams in the LSST era. The Arizona-NOAO Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES) is one such broker. In this work, we develop a machine learning pipeline to characterize and classify variable and transient sources only using the available multiband optical photometry. We describe three illustrative stages of the pipeline, serving the three goals of early, intermediate, and retrospective classification of alerts. The first takes the form of variable versus transient categorization, the second a multiclass typing of the combined variable and transient data set, and the third a purity-driven subtyping of a transient class. Although several similar algorithms have proven themselves in simulations, we validate their performance on real observations for the first time. We quantitatively evaluate our pipeline on sparse, unevenly sampled, heteroskedastic data from various existing observational campaigns, and demonstrate very competitive classification performance. We describe our progress toward adapting the pipeline developed in this work into a real-time broker working on live alert streams from time-domain surveys.Lasker Fellowship at the Space Telescope Science Institute; SKA SA; NRF; AIMS; NSF INSPIRE grant [CISE AST-1344204]; NOAO Community Science Data Center (CSDC)This item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

Commercial ship routes joining Europe with other cultures are vivid examples of cultural interaction, while shipwrecks and submerged sites, unreachable to wide public are excellent samples that can benefit from immersive technologies, augmented and virtual reality. The projects aim to bring inherently unreachable underwater cultural heritage within digital reach of the wide public using virtual visits and immersive technologies. Apart from reusing existing 3D data of underwater shipwrecks and sites, with respect to ethics, rights and licensing, to provide a personalized dry visit to a museum visitor or augmented reality to the diver, it also emphasizes on developing pre- and after- encounter of the digital or physical museum visitor. The former one is implemented exploiting geospatial enabled technologies for developing a serious game of sailing over ancient Mediterranean and the latter for an underwater shipwreck excavation game. Both games are realized thought social media, in order to facilitate information exchange among users. The project supports dry visits providing immersive experience through VR Cave and 3D info kiosks on museums or through the web. Additionally, aims to significantly enhance the experience of the diver, visitor or scholar, using underwater augmented reality in a tablet and an underwater housing.

132714466,2017-09-01T00:00:00,"Bulk body motion may randomly occur during PET acquisitions introducing blurring, attenuation emission mismatches and, in dynamic PET, discontinuities in the measured time activity curves between consecutive frames. Meanwhile, dynamic PET scans are longer, thus increasing the probability of bulk motion. In this study, we propose a streamlined 3D PET motion-compensated image reconstruction (3D-MCIR) framework, capable of robustly deconvolving intra-frame motion from a static or dynamic 3D sinogram. The presented 3D-MCIR methods need not partition the data into multiple gates, such as 4D MCIR algorithms, or access list-mode (LM) data, such as LM MCIR methods, both associated with increased computation or memory resources. The proposed algorithms can support compensation for any periodic and non-periodic motion, such as cardio-respiratory or bulk motion, the latter including rolling, twisting or drifting. Inspired from the widely adopted point-spread function (PSF) deconvolution 3D PET reconstruction techniques, here we introduce an image-based 3D generalized motion deconvolution method within the standard 3D maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction framework. In particular, we initially integrate a motion blurring kernel, accounting for every tracked motion within a frame, as an additional MLEM modeling component in the image space (integrated 3D-MCIR). Subsequently, we replaced the integrated model component with a nested iterative Richardson-Lucy (RL) image-based deconvolution method to accelerate the MLEM algorithm convergence rate (RL-3D-MCIR). The final method was evaluated with realistic simulations of whole-body dynamic PET data employing the XCAT phantom and real human bulk motion profiles, the latter estimated from volunteer dynamic MRI scans. In addition, metabolic uptake rate K-i parametric images were generated with the standard Patlak method. Our results demonstrate significant improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and noise bias performance in both dynamic and parametric images. The proposed nested RL-3D-MCIR method is implemented on the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) open-source platform and is scheduled for public release. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

335619155,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The Audio-to-Score framework consists of two separate stages: pre- processing and alignment. The alignment is commonly solved through offline Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which is a method to find the path over the distortion matrix with the minimum cost to determine the relation between the performance and the musical score times. In this work we propose a par- allel online DTW solution based on a client-server architecture. The current version of the application has been implemented for multi-core architectures (x86, x64 and ARM), thus covering either powerful systems or mobile devices. An extensive experimentation has been conducted in order to validate the software. The experiments also show that our framework allows to achieve a good score alignment within the real-time window by using parallel computing techniques.This work has been partially supported by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER under Projects TEC2012-38142-C04-01, TEC2012-38142-C04-03, TEC2012-38142-C04-04, TEC2015-67387-C4-1-R, TEC2015-67387-C4-3-R, TEC2015-67387-C4-4-R, the European Union FEDER (CAPAP-H5 network TIN2014-53522-REDT), and the Generalitat Valenciana under Grant PROMETEOII/2014/003.Alonso-Jordá, P.; Cortina, R.; Rodríguez-Serrano, F.; Vera-Candeas, P.; Alonso-González, M.; Ranilla, J.

275635798,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wellness state is affected by the habitability state of the domestic environment. Monitoring it can help to discover the causes of a low wellness levels aiding people in the improvement of their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a system to monitor the wellness state of people utilizing Likert¿s scale to determine the state of the user through an emoticon-based human¿computer interaction. The system is intended for domestic environments and measures the habitability conditions of the dwelling (such as temperature, humidity, luminosity and noise) employing sensors. An algorithm is designed in order to establish how to measure those conditions and to calculate the statistics that allows tracking their progress. The obtained information is presented to the user to compare his/her wellness state with the habitability conditions. Measures in a real domestic environment were performed in order to determine the configuration of our system. The energy efficiency of the algorithm provides an improvement between 99.36 and 99.62% in the energy consumption depending on the selected parameters.This work has been partially supported by the “Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación”, through the “Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008–2011” and by the “Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte”, through the grand “Ayudas para contratos predoctorales de Formación del Profesorado Universitario FPU14/02953”.García-García, L.; Parra-Boronat, L.; Romero Martínez, JO.; Lloret, J.

145138931,2017-07-20T00:00:00,"International audiencePerformance is a critical challenge in mobile image processing. Given a reference imaging pipeline, or even human-adjusted pairs of images, we seek to reproduce the enhancements and enable real-time evaluation. For this, we introduce a new neural network architecture inspired by bilateral grid processing and local affine color transforms. Using pairs of input/output images , we train a convolutional neural network to predict the coefficients of a locally-affine model in bilateral space. Our architecture learns to make local, global, and content-dependent decisions to approximate the desired image transformation. At runtime, the neural network consumes a low-resolution version of the input image, produces a set of affine transformations in bilateral space, upsamples those transformations in an edge-preserving fashion using a new slicing node, and then applies those upsampled transformations to the full-resolution image. Our algorithm processes high-resolution images on a smartphone in milliseconds, provides a real-time viewfinder at 1080p resolution, and matches the quality of state-of-the-art approximation techniques on a large class of image operators. Unlike previous work, our model is trained off-line from data and therefore does not require access to the original operator at runtime. This allows our model to learn complex, scene-dependent transformations for which no reference implementation is available, such as the photographic edits of a human retoucher",Deep Bilateral Learning for Real-Time Image Enhancement,10.1145/3072959.3073592,https://core.ac.uk/download/145138931.pdf,,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we combine semantic web-mining and situated robot perception to develop a system capable of assigning semantic categories to regions of space. This is accomplished by looking at web-mined relationships between room categories and objects identified by a Convolutional Neural Network trained on 1000 categories.

304674541,2018-06-01T07:00:00,"Phishing is one of the most harmful social engineering techniques to subdue end users where threat actors find a chance to gain access to critical information systems. A common approach in phishing is through the use of e-mail communication with an embedded hyperlink. The detection and mitigation of phishing attacks are a grand challenge due to the complexity of current phishing attacks. Existing techniques are often too time consuming to be used in the real world in terms of detection and mitigation time. Likewise, they employ static detection rules that are not effective in the real world due to the dynamics of phishing attacks. In this paper, we present PhishLimiter, a new detection and mitigation approach, where we first propose a new technique for deep packet inspection (DPI) and then leverage it with software-defined networking (SDN) to identify phishing activities through e-mail and web-based communication. The proposed DPI approach consists of two components: phishing signature classification and real-time DPI. Based on the programmability of SDN, we develop the store and forward mode and the forward and inspect mode to the direct network traffic by using an artificial neural network model to classify phishing attack signatures and design the real-time DPI so that PhishLimiter can flexibly address the dynamics of phishing attacks in the real world. PhishLimiter also provides better network traffic management for containing phishing attacks since it has the global view of a network through SDN. Furthermore, we evaluate PhishLimiter using a real-world testbed environment and data sets consisting of real-world email with embedded links.

Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed strategy, existing predictive models previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models are made publicly available in the first community Food Safety Model Repository called openFSMR (https://sites.google.com/site/openfsmr/).This work illustrates that a standardized information exchange format for predictive microbial models can be established by adoption of resources from Systems Biology.

Interesting or anomalous phenomena must be quickly characterized and followed up with additional measurements via optimal deployment of limited assets. Modern astronomy presents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital synoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray bursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially hazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning tools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.

Results: In this study, we proposed a new exact test based on the translation of rate comparison to two binomial distributions. With modeling and real datasets, the exact binomial test (EBT) showed an advantage in balancing the statistical precision and power, by providing an appropriate size of significant features for further studies. Both correlation analysis and bootstrapping tests demonstrated that EBT is as robust as the typical rate-comparison methods, e.g. chi(2) test, Fisher&apos;s exact test and Binomial test. Performance comparison among machine learning models with features identified by different statistical tests further demonstrated the advantage of EBT. The new test was also applied to analyze the genome-wide somatic gene mutation rate difference between lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), two main lung cancer subtypes and a list of new markers were identified that could be lineage-specifically associated with carcinogenesis of LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Interestingly, three cilia genes were found selectively with high mutation rates in LUSC, possibly implying the importance of cilia dysfunction in the carcinogenesis.

Neuromorphic computing systems are designed to accelerate neuronal network emulations and use analogue circuits to mimic neurobiological architectures. One of such systems, created by the Electronic Vision(s) Group in Kirchhoff Institute for Physics, Heidelberg University, Germany, is the “Spikey” chip. This neuromorphic system comprises 384 neurons and 98304 synapses and emulates neuronal activity 10000-fold faster than biological real-time. The aim of the study is to estimate the simulation efficiency and learning accuracy of the auto-associative memory model, implemented on the Spikey neuromorphic system. Materials and Methods: „Spikey“ chip is programmable with the PyNN API in Python programming language. Auto-associative neural network was programmed using PyNN API. Network consists of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons connected all-to-all by excitatory synapses and a group of all-to-all inhibitory connections controlling a spiking rate. Symmetric and asymmetric STDP learning rules were used for excitatory-excitatory synaptic connections, while excitatory-inhibitory and inhibitory-excitatory synaptic connections had constant weight values assigned at the start of the experiment. Spike bursts with the varying spike counts were used as the inputs. Results: Pattern recall accuracy was highest with the symmetric STDP learning rule and a larger number of spikes in the spike bursts. There is a strong interference with the network activity from the hardware inherent noise and spike delays, reducing overall recall accuracy and learning capacity.[...]Lietuvos sveikatos mokslų universitetasTaikomosios informatikos katedraVytauto Didžiojo universiteta",Auto-associative network implementation in the neuromorphic chip „Spikey“,,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
185523039,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"A key requirement of autonomous vehicles is the capability to safely navigate in their environment. However, outside of controlled environments, safe navigation is a very difficult problem. In particular, the real-world often contains both complex 3D structure, and dynamic obstacles such as people or other vehicles. Dynamic obstacles are particularly challenging, as a principled solution requires planning trajectories with regard to both vehicle dynamics, and the motion of the obstacles. Additionally, the real-time requirements imposed by obstacle motion, coupled with real-world computational limitations, make classical optimality and completeness guarantees difficult to satisfy. We present a unified optimization-based motion planning and control solution, that can navigate in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. By combining optimal and receding-horizon control, with temporal multi-resolution lattices, we can precompute optimal motion primitives, and allow real-time planning of physically-feasible trajectories in complex environments with dynamic obstacles. We demonstrate the framework by solving difficult indoor 3D quadcopter navigation scenarios, where it is necessary to plan in time.

159636017,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Le frane per crollo da ammassi rocciosi fratturati sono tra i processi di instabilità gravitativa che più frequentemente interessano opere antropiche quali tagli su versanti naturali o artificiali, pareti di cava, trincee stradali, autostradali o ferroviarie, sia per ciò che attiene le aree di distacco che per quelle di accumulo. Nell’ambito dell’applicazione di sistemi di early warning per la gestione del rischio geologico legato a queste tipologie di frana, una sperimentazione della tecnica del monitoraggio nanosismometrico è stata effettuata presso due siti estrattivi non più in attività: le “Pirrere” della Baia di Cala Rossa sull’isola di Favignana (Trapani), in Sicilia, e la cava dismessa di Acuto (Frosinone), in Italia Centrale. Il monitoraggio nanosismometrico è una tecnica di indagine che consente di individuare e localizzare deboli eventi sismici, fino a magnitudo locale (ML) nell’ordine di -3, attraverso l’impiego di quattro sensori sismometrici disposti secondo una specifica geometria di array detta SNS (Seismic Navigation System).

Nel presente lavoro, mediante il software NanoseismicSuite sono stati analizzati 73 eventi di crollo indotti artificialmente attraverso la caduta controllata di blocchi di roccia nei due siti estrattivi abbandonati; sono stati lanciati, simulando fenomeni di rockfalls, rispettivamente 47 blocchi di roccia nella cava di Acuto e 26 eventi in quattro diverse cave a cielo aperto presenti nel settore occidentale di Cala Rossa. Tali eventi, avendo punto epicentrale noto, hanno permesso di determinare il miglior modello di sottosuolo in termini di valori di velocità delle onde P ed S attraverso un’operazione di back analysis. L’analisi è stata, infatti, effettuata variando i valori di velocità e scegliendo quelli relativi all’epicentro teorico ottenuto dall’analisi dell’evento che fosse il più vicino possibile al punto reale di impatto del blocco di roccia. Al fine di valutare la sensibilità della geometria dell’array SNS e l’influenza del sito di installazione sulla capacità di individuare e localizzare gli eventi, le sperimentazioni sono state condotte sia variando il raggio di apertura che la zona di installazione degli array: presso Acuto le acquisizioni di segnale sono state condotte prima con un array SNS con apertura di 20 m e successivamente con un array di apertura 10 m, mentre presso Cala Rossa l’array è stato installato alternativamente all’aperto in un’area di plateau roccioso ed in una galleria facente parte dell’area di cava abbandonata.

Analizzando i dati si è ottenuta una precisione dell’ubicazione epicentrale compresa tra il 10 ed il 22% della distanza che intercorre tra la sorgente e l’array nanosismometrico. Il miglior modello di sottosuolo ottenuto per entrambi i casi di studio è risultato avere una velocità delle onde P pari a 900 m/s ed un rapporto VP/VS pari a 1.73, valori in accordo con le condizioni di intenso stato di fratturazione delle rocce carbonatiche affioranti nelle due zone di cava. Per gli eventi di crollo indotti la magnitudo ML è risultata essere compresa tra -2.8 e -1.3; considerando l’energia sviluppata dall’impatto, legata alla massa del blocco ed all’altezza e alla velocità di caduta, non è stato possibile definire una relazione tra magnitudo ed energia, probabilmente a causa delle differenti caratteristiche del punto di impatto dei diversi blocchi. In generale, si è osservato che la precisione di ubicazione degli eventi, in termini di azimuth e distanza dal reale epicentro, è risultata paragonabile sia variando l’apertura dell’array che variando il sito di installazione. Per il sito sperimentale di Acuto, il processo di picking manuale del tempo di primo arrivo delle onde P è risultato essere più affidabile nel caso di array con apertura pari a 10 m. La sperimentazione effettuata a Cala Rossa ha permesso, invece, di osservare una migliore capacità di individuazione degli eventi nelle tracce relative all’array posizionato in galleria a causa della minore rumorosità di base del sito di installazione.

Tra le registrazioni sismometriche sono state identificate varie tipologie di segnali, oltre a quelli generati dal lancio dei blocchi, alcune riconducibili ad eventi naturali di crollo altre a deboli terremoti. L’analisi dei segnali riferibili alla prima tipologia di eventi naturali, effettuata tenendo in considerazione i modelli di sottosuolo precedentemente calibrati, ha portato all’identificazione in ambedue i siti di aree aventi maggiore suscettibilità a frane per crollo. In definitiva, si può ritenere che i risultati ottenuti in questo studio siano incoraggianti rispetto all’efficacia della tecnica di monitoraggio nanosismometrico nell’individuazione e nell’ubicazione di fenomeni di crollo in roccia e portano a ritenere questa tecnica potenzialmente applicabile in aree in cui tali eventi possono interferire con infrastrutture antropiche.In the frame of early warning and risk mitigation studies for landslide processes involving rock masses, two quarry areas (Cala Rossa Bay in Sicily and Acuto in Central Italy) were monitored with SNS (Seismic Navigation System) arrays. In this study, 73 rockfalls were simulated by launches of rock blocks. This allowed to perform a back analysis for defining the best seismic velocity model of the subsoil half-space; the records related to each impact caused by the rock block launch were managed by the nanoseismic monitoring approach, varying the velocity model to obtain a theoretical epicentre as close as possible to the actual location of the impact point. In order to evaluate the sensibility of the SNS array, the results obtained by different array apertures and positions were compared in terms of azimuth and distance error with respect to the real epicentres. On the other hand, several natural rockfalls were detected; their analysis allowed to identify areas having higher susceptibility to rockfalls by using the previously calibrated subsoil half-space model. Further studies are required to better define the areas prone to rockfall generation in the considered test sites; nevertheless, the here obtained results show an encouraging perspective about the application of the nanoseismic monitoring with respect to vulnerable infrastructures in rockfall prone areas",Nanoseismic monitoring for detection of rockfalls.

237331362,2018-10-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThis work deals with the optimization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). It elaborates on the concept of Adaptive Energy-Accuracy Scaling through multi-precision arithmetic, a solution that allows ConvNets to be adapted at run-time and meet different energy budgets and accuracy constraints. The strategy is particularly suited for embedded applications made run at the “edge” on resource-constrained platforms. After the very basics that distinguish the proposed adaptive strategy, the paper recalls the software-to-hardware vertical implementation of precision scalable arithmetic for ConvNets, then it focuses on the energy-driven per-layer precision assignment problem describing a meta-heuristic that searches for the most suited representation of both weights and activations of the neural network. The same heuristic is then used to explore the optimal trade-off providing the Pareto points in the energy-accuracy space. Experiments conducted on three different ConvNets deployed in real-life applications, i.e. Image Classification, Keyword Spotting, and Facial Expression Recognition, show adaptive ConvNets reach better energy-accuracy trade-off w.r.t. conventional static fixed-point quantization methods",Energy-Accuracy Scalable Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: A Pareto Analysis,10.1007/978-3-030-23425-6_6,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

This area of intervention poses many challenges, including the necessary flexibility and adaptability to real unconstrained therapeutic settings, which are different from the constrained lab settings where most of the technology is typically tested. Among the most common impairments of children with autism and intellectual disability is social attention, which includes difficulties in establishing the correct visual focus of attention. This article presents an investigation on the use of novel deep learning neural network architectures for automatically estimating if the child is focusing their visual attention on the robot during a therapy session, which is an indicator of their engagement. To study the application, the authors gathered data from a clinical experiment in an unconstrained setting, which provided low-resolution videos recorded by the robot camera during the child&ndash;robot interaction. Two deep learning approaches are implemented in several variants and compared with a standard algorithm for face detection to verify the feasibility of estimating the status of the child directly from the robot sensors without relying on bulky external settings, which can distress the child with autism.

185549869,2018,"The characterization of the melting layer (ML) is an important task for operational radar meteorology. Melting layer identification may be used to establish distances at which radar rainfall estimates become affected by melting hydrometeors, with benefits for operational hydrometeor classification, as snowfall, freezing rain and liquid precipitation. Consequently, this yields a significant performance improvement in radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) on ground. Furthermore, knowledge of the ML location is also important for microphysical cloud characterization and the evaluation of icing potential. Several studies and algorithms exist in literature for characterizing ML through radar measurement signature, the most popular being the increase in the radar reflectivity factor known as bright. For dual polarization radar, ML detection can be pursued using specific signatures of dual polarization measurements, such as differential reflectivity ZDR, co-polar correlation coefficient \rhoHV , specific differential phase KDP, and linear depolarization ratio LDR that exhibit well-pronounced ML signatures both in stratiform and even in convective situations. Moreover, ML and rainfall have a strong influence on satellite links signals, as they are attenuated due to the presence of hydrometeors along the propagation path. In stratiform precipitation systems, the ML is the upper limit of the rainfall column height that is responsible of the attenuation of radio signals. Therefore, ML climatology is proficiently used for designing satellites links relative to a specific area. Very recently, a new X-band Doppler, dual-polarization weather radar system has been installed in Florence funded by the Tuscany Region Government within the NEFOCAST project. The latter investigates a new concept system that aims at providing real time precipitation maps trough the attenuation measurements collected by a dense population of new-generation interactive satellite terminals (called SmartLNB, Smart Low-Noise Block converter). A number of SmartLNB has been deployed in the Tuscany region and a test bed has been established in cooperation with the schools of the Florence Metropolitan city. In the present study, the potential of the new weather radar system is investigated for characterizing the ML in terms of height and thickness under different meteorological conditions and cloud systems. Measurements collected in the RangeHeight Indicator (RHI) scan mode along the direction to the Eutelsat 10A satellite (used for the experimental campaign of the NEFOCAST project) have been analysed with the simultaneous attenuation estimation obtained by the SmartLNBs with radar coverage during selected precipitative events. Statistical analyses have been performed based on both weather radar and SmartLNB measurements, supplemented by ancillary observations from some rain gauges (both impact and tipping-bucket types) co-located with SmartLNBs. In addition, a C-band radar system (Polar 55C) located in Rome has also been used for this work. Polar 55C dual polarization measurements have been analysed with respect to co-located SmartLNBs and laser disdrometer. The results of this analysis highlight the effects of ML on radio signal attenuation, as the total attenuation of signal increases also with the increase of ML vertical thickness. Therefore, the characterization of the vertical profile of precipitation is mandatory for implementing accurate QPE on ground, both from radars and satellite links",Studies of the melting layer of precipitative systems using X-band dual polarization weather radar and SmartLNB network,10.18174/454537,,,'Wageningen University and Research',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level.

We compare our results with those of 4 state-of-the-art techniques and baselines on ground-truth data from 2 evaluation datasets. Our GSP tech- nique achieves excellent performances, with the best F 1 = 0.91, sensibly outperforming benchmark techniques that achieve F 1 ≤ 0.78",GSP (Geo-Semantic-Parsing): Geoparsing and Geotagging with Machine Learning on Top of Linked Data,10.1007/978-3-319-93417-4_2,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Hearing loss, a partial or total inability to hear, is one of the most commonly reported disabilities. A hearing test can be carried out by an audiologist to assess a patient’s auditory system. However, the procedure requires an appointment, which can result in delays and practitioner fees. In addition, there are often challenges associated with the unavailability of equipment and qualified practitioners, particularly in remote areas. This paper presents a novel idea that automatically identifies any hearing impairment based on a cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition approach. The proposed system uses an adaptive filter bank with weighted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for feature extraction. The adaptive filter bank implementation is inspired by the principle of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio that is aware of its environment and adapts to statistical variations in the input stimuli by learning from the environment. Comparative performance evaluation demonstrates the potential of our automated hearing test method to achieve comparable results to the clinical ground truth, established by the expert audiologist’s tests. The overall absolute error of the proposed model when compared with the expert audiologist test is less than 4.9 dB and 4.4 dB for the pure tone and speech audiometry tests, respectively. The overall accuracy achieved is 96.67% with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The proposed method potentially offers a second opinion to audiologists, and serves as a cost-effective pre-screening test to predict hearing loss at an early stage. In future work, authors intend to explore the application of advanced deep learning and optimization approaches to further enhance the performance of the automated testing prototype considering imperfect datasets with real-world background noise.Published versio",Cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition for automated hearing loss testing,10.1007/s12559-018-9607-4,https://core.ac.uk/download/286356367.pdf,"[{'title': 'Cognitive Computation', 'identifiers': ['issn:1866-9964', '1866-9956', '1866-9964', 'issn:1866-9956']}]",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
346489551,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Large modern surveys require efficient review of data in order to find transient sources such as supernovae, and to distinguish such sources from artefacts and noise. Much effort has been put into the development of automatic algorithms, but surveys still rely on human review of targets. This paper presents an integrated system for the identification of supernovae in data from Pan-STARRS1, combining classifications from volunteers participating in a citizen science project with those from a convolutional neural network. The unique aspect of this work is the deployment, in combination, of both human and machine classifications for near real-time discovery in an astronomical project. We show that the combination of the two methods outperforms either one used individually. This result has important implications for the future development of transient searches, especially in the era of LSST and other large-throughput surveys",A transient search using combined human and machine classifications,,,,'Oxford University Press (OUP)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
304117829,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Deep Learning is increasingly being adopted by industry for computer vision applications running on embedded devices. While Convolutional Neural Networks' accuracy has achieved a mature and remarkable state, inference latency and throughput are a major concern especially when targeting low-cost and low-power embedded platforms. CNNs' inference latency may become a bottleneck for Deep Learning adoption by industry, as it is a crucial specification for many real-time processes. Furthermore, deployment of CNNs across heterogeneous platforms presents major compatibility issues due to vendor-specific technology and acceleration libraries.In this work, we present QS-DNN, a fully automatic search based on Reinforcement Learning which, combined with an inference engine optimizer, efficiently explores through the design space and empirically finds the optimal combinations of libraries and primitives to speed up the inference of CNNs on heterogeneous embedded devices. We show that, an optimized combination can achieve 45x speedup in inference latency on CPU compared to a dependency-free baseline and 2x on average on GPGPU compared to the best vendor library. Further, we demonstrate that, the quality of results and time ""to-solution"" is much better than with Random Search and achieves up to 15x better results for a short-time search",Learning to infer: RL-based search for DNN primitive selection on Heterogeneous Embedded Systems,10.23919/DATE.2019.8714959,https://core.ac.uk/download/304117829.pdf,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275634114,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay communications networks have emerged as a new paradigm for implementing distributed services in microgrids due to their potential benefits: they are robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, and they can route messages even with a large number of nodes which are frequently entering or leaving from the network. However, current P2P systems have been mainly developed for file sharing or cycle sharing applications where the processes of searching and managing resources are not optimized. Locality algorithms have gained a lot of attention due to their potential to provide an optimized path to groups with similar interests for routing messages in order to get better network performance. This paper develops a fully functional decentralized communication architecture with a new P2P locality algorithm and a specific protocol for monitoring and control of microgrids. Experimental results show that the proposed locality algorithm reduces the number of lookup messages and the lookup delay time. Moreover, the proposed communication architecture heavily depends of the lookup used algorithm as well as the placement of the communication layers within the architecture. Experimental results will show that the proposed techniques meet the network requirements of smart microgrids even with a large number of nodes on stream.This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant ENE2015-64087-C2-2R.

346545484,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"While many VA workflows make use of machine-learned models to support analytical tasks, VA workflows have become increasingly important in understanding and improving Machine Learning (ML) processes. In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly",VIS4ML: an ontology for visual analytics assisted machine learning,,,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
154803302,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Many tasks involve the fine manipulation of objects despite limited visual feedback. In such scenarios, tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven, functional contour-following task: the closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable, transparent, and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robot&#x0027;s pinch grasp. A Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (C-MAB) reinforcement learning algorithm was implemented to maximize cumulative rewards by balancing exploration versus exploitation of the state-action space. The C-MAB learner outperformed a benchmark Q-learner by more efficiently exploring the state-action space while learning a hard-to-code task. The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours (wire, rope).

212809293,2017-11-27T00:00:00,"Real-Time PCR (qPCR) testing is recommended as both a diagnostic and outcome measurement of etiological treatment in clinical practice and clinical trials of Chagas disease (CD), but no external quality assurance (EQA) program provides performance assessment of the assays in use. We implemented an EQA system to evaluate the performance of molecular biology laboratories involved in qPCR based follow-up in clinical trials of CD. An EQA program was devised for three clinical trials of CD: the E1224 (NCT01489228), a pro-drug of ravuconazole; the Sampling Study (NCT01678599), that used benznidazole, both conducted in Bolivia; and the CHAGASAZOL (NCT01162967), that tested posaconazole, conducted in Spain. Four proficiency testing panels containing negative controls and seronegative blood samples spiked with 1, 10 and 100 parasite equivalents (par. eq.)/mL of four Trypanosoma cruzi stocks, were sent from the Core Lab in Argentina to the participating laboratories located in Bolivia and Spain. Panels were analyzed simultaneously, blinded to sample allocation, at 4-month intervals. In addition, 302 random blood samples from both trials carried out in Bolivia were sent to Core Lab for retesting analysis. The analysis of proficiency testing panels gave 100% of accordance (within laboratory agreement) and concordance (between laboratory agreement) for all T. cruzi stocks at 100 par. eq./mL; whereas their values ranged from 71 to 100% and from 62 to 100% at 1 and 10 par. eq./mL, respectively, depending on the T. cruzi stock. The results obtained after twelve months of preparation confirmed the stability of blood samples in guanidine-EDTA buffer. No significant differences were found between qPCR results from Bolivian laboratory and Core Lab for retested clinical samples. This EQA program for qPCR analysis of CD patient samples may significantly contribute to ensuring the quality of laboratory data generated in clinical trials and molecular diagnostics laboratories of CD.Fil: Ramirez Gomez, Juan Carlos.

132585739,2018-03-15T00:00:00,"Over the years, collaborative mobility proved to be an important but challenging component of the smart
cities paradigm. One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of whatif decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems. We demonstrate that the use of graphs and time series in multi-dimensional data models can satisfy the requirements of descriptive and predictive analytics in real-world case studies with massive amounts of continuously changing data. The features of the framework are explained in a case study of a complex collaborative mobility system that combines carpooling, carsharing and shared parking. The performance of the framework is tested with a large-scale dataset, performing machine learning tasks and interactive realtime data visualization.

While this aspect is important, we recognize that the teaching methods in a majority of the STEM courses today are broken; there is a major discrepancy between the skills and mindsets in technical classes and the ones that are useful to solve actual problems in 'the real world'. Therefore, we suggest a new teaching framework called Data-X where entrepreneurial teaching methods developed in the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship are applied to advanced technical topics. Through inductive learning and by practicing story creation, stakeholder generation, adaptation, ideation, innovation processes, and by having a diverse mix of students being coached by a network of expert advisors, this highly applied teaching method empowers students to pursue and find solutions to open-ended projects and problems. The Data-X framework has been implemented and tested for three semesters in a UC Berkeley course called Applied Data Science for Venture Applications. In the class the students pick up, become comfortable, and utilize state-of-the-art tools in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The results, feedback, and testimonials we have received upon offering the class have been overwhelmingly positive, and we propose that the ideas and concepts behind Data-X can help fix many problems in modern STEM education",Applying Entrepreneurial Teaching Methods to Advanced Technical STEM Courses,10.1109/ICE.2018.8436264,,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In fact, a graph can describe a given pattern as a complex structure made up of parts (the nodes) and relationships between them (the edges). Despite their rich representational power, most of machine learning approaches cannot deal directly with inputs encoded by graphs. Indeed, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been devised as an extension of recursive models, able to process general graphs, possibly undirected and cyclic. In particular, GNNs can be trained to approximate all the “practically useful” functions on the graph space, based on the classical inductive learning approach, realized within the supervised framework. However, the information encoded in the edges can actually be used in a more refined way, to switch from inductive to transductive learning. In this paper, we present an inductive–transductive learning scheme based on GNNs. The proposed approach is evaluated both on artificial and real–world datasets showing promising results.

Sin embargo, los ecosistemas de bosques secos en Ecuador están en peligro de convertirse en una fuente de emisiones de carbono debido a la deforestación. A menudo falta información espacial, necesaria para cuantificar la pérdida potencial de carbono a la atmósfera. Esto se aplica particularmente a áreas remotas de accesibilidad limitada. Este estudio tiene como objetivo regionalizar las reservas de COS de un ecosistema de bosque seco pequeño y poco accesible en el suroeste de Ecuador mediante el uso de modelos de árbol de regresión reforzado (BRT). El nuevo muestreo en un enfoque de validación cruzada repetida anidada se aplicó para desarrollar modelos robustos para un conjunto de datos de 118 muestras con información predictiva limitada. Para seleccionar un conjunto óptimo de parámetros del modelo, se aplicó la optimización por evolución diferencial (DE) para el ajuste de parámetros. La selección de predictores se implementó utilizando el mismo algoritmo de optimización. Este estudio demuestra cómo se puede mejorar el rendimiento predictivo de los modelos BRT mediante la aplicación de un enfoque de optimización para el ajuste de parámetros y la selección de predictores. El rendimiento del modelo se mejoró en aproximadamente un 40% con respecto al R2. Aún así, los resultados también demostraron las dificultades de las aplicaciones de aprendizaje automático en áreas naturales pequeñas y altamente heterogéneas. Se asumió que factores muy variables o incluso aleatorios distorsionan la relación entre las variables predictoras y de respuesta. Suponemos que el enfoque presentado es particularmente exitoso en el caso de un espacio de parámetros de sintonización multivariado de valor real.

However, dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador are endangered to become a source of carbon emissions because of deforestation. Often spatial information, necessary to quantify potential carbon loss to the atmosphere, is missing. This particularly applies to remote areas of limited accessibility. This study aims to regionalise the SOC stocks of a small and poorly accessible dry forest ecosystem in southwestern Ecuador by using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Resampling in a nested repeated k-fold cross validation approach was applied to develop robust models for a dataset of 118 samples with limited predictor information. To select an optimal set of model parameters, optimisation by differential evolution (DE) was applied for parameter tuning. Predictor selection was implemented using the same optimisation algorithm. This study demonstrates how the predictive performance of BRT models can be improved by applying an optimisation approach for parameter tuning and predictor selection. Model performance was improved by approximately 40% concerning the R2. Still, the results also demonstrated the difficulties of machine learning applications in small and highly heterogeneous natural areas. Very variable or even random factors were assumed to distort the relationship between predictor and response variables. We assume that the presented approach is particularly successful in the case of a real-valued multivariate space of tuning parameters.

However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies.

In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle¿s internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and European Union, grant DPI2016-81002-R, by Generalitat Valenciana, grant APOSTD/2017/055, and by the European Union too through the European Social Fund (ESF).

Materials and methods: AChE inhibitory activity was evaluated both in liquid (five different concentrations of the extract, from 1 to 100 mu g/mL) and in solid (seven different concentrations of the extract, from 0.5 to 10.0 mu g) by methods well described in literature, while mutagenicity was estimated using the Ames test (four different concentrations of the extract, from 0.106 to 1.328mg/plate). Results: Ochridaspongia rotunda acetone extract exhibited promising AChE inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner both in liquid (IC50 23.07 mu g/mL) and in solid (1.50 mu g). Furthermore, the Ames test revealed no sign of mutagenicity at any concentration tested. Its FTIR spectrum coupled with the positive Liebermann-Burchard, Salkowski and Zak color reactions (tests) indicated the presence of sterol compounds. Discussion and conclusion: The screened extract may inspire a search for novel anticholinesterase therapeutic agent(s) potentially used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Further research will be directed toward its detailed chemical analysis along with addressing the issue of a real producer of the natural product(s) responsible for the AChE activity observed",Further insight into the bioactivity of the freshwater sponge Ochridaspongia rotunda,10.1080/13880209.2017.1297468,https://core.ac.uk/download/493437848.pdf,"[{'title': 'Pharmaceutical Biology', 'identifiers': ['1388-0209', 'issn:1388-0209']}]",'Informa UK Limited',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
200793946,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Augmented reality (AR) is a new technology. Very few people know about its development, which began in 1970s from massive and primitive devices. Now AR is at the very peak of its improvement in the form of various software. Augmented reality has its application in the following devices: glasses, phones, tablets. Augmented reality works on the basis of two stages: object recognition and marker tracking. Recognition occurs on the basis of machine learning and tracking of markers by finding certain elements or special markers. The analogue of this principle of operation is SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building). But the best results are achieved with the simultaneous use of two technologies. AR is involved in different areas: education, medicine, entertainment, military training. For education, three-dimensional 3D models are used, which are more visual for students and simplify their studies. In entertainment, AR has found a place for itself in various social networks in the form of masks (Snapchat), games (Pokemon GO) and others. In medicine, in addition to training, AR is used to visualize the internal organs of patients. Augmented reality has great potential for development in practical application in everyday life environments because it does not require high hardware characteristics.Дополненная реальность, или AR (augmented reality) – новая технология, развитие которой сейчас мало кому известно. Она начала развитие в 70-х годах прошлого века от массивных и примитивных устройств. Сейчас же находится на самом пике своего совершенствования в виде различных ПО. Дополненная реальность имеет свое применение в следующий устройствах: очки, телефоны, планшеты. AR работает на основе двух этапов: распознавание объектов и отслеживание маркеров. Распознавание происходит на базе машинного обучения, а отслеживание маркеров путем нахождения определенных элементов или специальных маркеров. Аналогом данного принципа работы является технология SLAM. Но наилучшие результаты достигаются при одновременном использовании двух технологий. AR заполняет все больше сфер. Для образования используют объемные 3D модели, которые являются более наглядными для студентов и упрощают их обучение. В развлечениях AR нашло себе место в различных социальных сетях в виде масок (Snapchat), игр (Pokemon GO) и других. В медицине, помимо обучения, AR используют для визуализации внутренних органов пациентов.

147051667,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: Helicobacter suis is a very fastidious microorganism associated with gastritis, gastric ulcers, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in humans. In vitro isolation of this agent from human patients has so far been unsuccessful. 
Materials and methods: A probe-based real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid detection of H.suis in gastric biopsies was developed. Secondly, a mouse-passage-based protocol was optimized for isolation of low numbers of viable H.suis bacteria. Mice were inoculated with different numbers of viable H.suis (10(2)-10(8)) and kept for 4weeks to allow multiplication of this pathogen. 
Results: The probe-based real-time PCR (RT-PCR) exhibited a high degree of diagnostic specificity and analytical sensitivity, high linear correlations (r(2) between 0.995 and 0.999), and high amplification efficiencies (>90%) for H.suis. No cross-reactivity was detected with human, porcine, non-human primate, and murine DNA nor with DNA from other bacteria including Helicobacter spp. and Campylobacter spp. H.suis was successfully re-isolated from the stomach of mice inoculated with at least 10(4) viable H.suis, using a biphasic medium (pH 5), consisting of Brucella agar with Brucella broth on top, both supplemented with vitox supplement, Campylobacter-selective supplement, amphotericin (5g/mL), HCl (0.05%), fetal bovine serum (20%), and linezolid (5g/mL). Linezolid was necessary to inhibit proliferation of contaminants, including lactobacilli. 
Conclusion: The methods described above can be implemented for detection or isolation of H.suis from human gastric biopsies",A novel isolation protocol and probe-based RT-PCR for diagnosis of gastric infections with the zoonotic pathogen Helicobacter suis,10.1111/hel.12369,,,'Wiley',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

275646691,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Computer clusters are widely used platforms to execute different computational workloads. Indeed, the advent of virtualization and Cloud computing has paved the way to deploy virtual elastic clusters on top of Cloud infrastructures, which are typically backed by physical computing clusters. In turn, the advances in Green computing have fostered the ability to dynamically power on the nodes of physical clusters as required. Therefore, this paper introduces an open-source framework to deploy elastic virtual clusters running on elastic physical clusters where the computing capabilities of the virtual clusters are dynamically changed to satisfy both the user application's computing requirements and to minimise the amount of energy consumed by the underlying physical cluster that supports an on-premises Cloud. For that, we integrate: i) an elasticity manager both at the infrastructure level (power management) and at the virtual infrastructure level (horizontal elasticity); ii) an automatic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation agent that reduces the amount of powered on physical nodes using live migration and iii) a vertical elasticity manager to dynamically and transparently change the memory allocated to VMs, thus fostering enhanced consolidation. A case study based on real datasets executed on a production infrastructure is used to validate the proposed solution. The results show that a multi-elastic virtualized datacenter provides users with the ability to deploy customized scalable computing clusters while reducing its energy footprint.The results of this work have been partially supported by ATMOSPHERE (Adaptive, Trustworthy, Manageable, Orchestrated, Secure, Privacy-assuring Hybrid, Ecosystem for Resilient Cloud Computing), funded by the European Commission under the Cooperation Programme, Horizon 2020 grant agreement No 777154.Alfonso Laguna, CD.; Caballer Fernández, M.; Calatrava Arroyo, A.; Moltó, G.; Blanquer Espert, I.
