In this study, we offer a system architecture model for detecting early water pump system failures based on data acquired by monitored controlled devices. We worked on real measured statistics, events, and failures from the water pumps sector in the tentative portion. Different preservation measures or tactics are being tried to maintain the industries' effectiveness. Preservation disrupts the value of goods works in any sector. To avoid being shocked or later breaking down, preservation procedures should be planned in such a way that the preservation task is reduced in both cost and time. This research study describes the implementation of a keen and Machine Learning architecture system for Predictive Maintenance or Preventive Preservation, based on the Random Forest method in an Industry sector, that considers the Internet of Things and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to support real-time statistics, an online collection of data, and analysis for detecting machine breakdowns sooner, allowing real-time monitoring on the data, visualization of the data, and analysis for detecting machine breakdowns earlier."

Typically, companies ingest data to data lakes, have elaborate ETL/ELT processes, and consume the data. Organizations have challenges in becoming data-driven at scale, with centralized teams and modules acting as bottlenecks, responsible for many aspects such as data governance, ingestion, or engineering. Placing the tools in the hands of developers and empowering engineers across all business domains truly unlocks the ability for a company to become data-driven, at scale, both in culture and practice. A self-service, multi-tenant, API-first, and scalable data platform is the foundational requirement in creating an enterprise data marketplace, which enables the creation, publishing, and exchange of data products. Such a marketplace enables the exploration and discovery of data products, further providing highlevel data governance and oversight on marketplace contents. In this paper, we describe our way to the gourmet data product marketplace. We cover the design principles, the implementation details, technology choices, and the journey to build an enterprise data platform that meets the above characteristics. The platform consists of ingestion, streaming, storage, transformation, schema generation, fail-safe, data sharing, access management, PII data automatic identification, self-service storage optimization recommendations, and CI/CD integration. We then show how the platform enables and operates the data marketplace, facilitating the exchange of stable data products across users and tenants. We motivate and show how we run scalable decentralized data governance. All of this is built and run for Cimpress Technology (CT), which operates the Mass Customization Platform for Cimpress and its businesses. The CT data platform serves 1000s of users from different platform participants, with data sourced from heterogeneous sources. Data is ingested at a rate of well over 1000 individual messages per second and serves more than 100k analytical queries daily."

For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies."

We propose in this research paper a system architecture model for detecting early water pump system failures by utilizing prevailing measurements captured by the monitored controlled devices. In the tentative portion, we have worked on real measured datasets, events, and failures from the water pumps sector. There are different preservation approaches or tactics that are being used to keep the effectiveness of the industries. For any specific industry, preservation disturbs the value of product works. To avoid shocking or later breakdown, the preservation methods ought to be deliberate in such a mode that the preservation tasked to decrease the conservation costs and the time required to implement them properly. This research study describes the deployment of a keen and Machine Learning architecture system for Predictive Maintenance or Preventive preservation, based on the Random Forest method in an Industry sector, that considers IoT (Internet of Things) and Machine Learning(ML) technologies to support the real-time statistics, an online collection of data, and analysis for detecting machine breakdowns sooner, allowing the real-time monitoring on the data, visualization of the statistics and schedule of preservation interventions to mitigate the existence of such failures in the water pumps. The deployed system architecture also integrates Machine Learning techniques to provision the technicians during the execution of preservation interventions.."

Live streaming experience is very susceptible to short-time-scale network congestion since client playback buffers are often no more than a few seconds. Unfortunately, identifying such streams and measuring their QoE for network management is challenging, since content providers largely use the same delivery infrastructure for live and videoon-demand (VoD) streaming, and packet inspection techniques (including SNI/DNS query monitoring) cannot always distinguish between the two. In this paper, we design, build, and deploy ReCLive: a machine learning method for live video detection and QoE measurement based on network-level behavioral characteristics. Our contributions are four-fold: (1) We analyze about 23,000 video streams from Twitch and YouTube, and identify key features in their traffic profile that differentiate live and on-demand streaming. We release our traffic traces as open data to the public; (2) We develop an LSTM-based binary classifier model that distinguishes live from on-demand streams in real-time with over 95% accuracy across providers; (3) We develop a method that estimates QoE metrics of live streaming flows in terms of resolution and buffer stall events with overall accuracies of 93% and 90%, respectively; and (4) Finally, we prototype our solution, train it in the lab, and deploy it in a live ISP network serving more than 7,000 subscribers. Measurements from the field show that 99.8% of Twitch videos are streamed live, while this measure is only 2.3% for YouTube. Further, during peak hours as many as 15% of live video streams are played at low-definition resolution and about 7% of them experience a buffer stall. Our method provides ISPs with fine-grained visibility into live video streams, enabling them to measure and improve user experience."

However, due to the diversity of machine learning libraries, the inconsistency between environments, and various scalability requirement, there is no existing work to date that addresses all of these challenges. Here, we introduce Bighead, a framework-agnostic, end-to-end platform for machine learning. It offers a seamless user experience requiring only minimal efforts that span feature set management, prototyping, training, batch (offline) inference, real-time (online) inference, evaluation, and model lifecycle management. In contrast to existing platforms, it is designed to be highly versatile and extensible, and supports all major machine learning frameworks, rather than focusing on one particular framework. It ensures consistency across different environments and stages of the model lifecycle, as well as across data sources and transformations. It scales horizontally and elastically in response to the workload such as dataset size and throughput. Its components include a feature management framework, a model development toolkit, a lifecycle management service with UI, an offline training and inference engine, an online inference service, an interactive prototyping environment, and a Docker image customization tool. It is the first platform to offer a feature management component that is a general-purpose aggregation framework with lambda architecture and temporal joins. Bighead is deployed and widely adopted at Airbnb, and has enabled the data science and engineering teams to develop and deploy machine learning models in a timely and reliable manner. Bighead has shortened the time to deploy a new model from months to days, ensured the stability of the models in production, facilitated adoption of cutting-edge models, and enabled advanced machine learning based product features of the Airbnb platform. We present two use cases of productionizing models of computer vision and natural language processing."

They have proven to be a more effective, accessible and cheaper solution compared to crewed aircraft. However, the ability to reliably detect and identify marine fauna is closely tied to pilot skill, experience and level of fatigue. Modern computer vision technology offers the possibility of improving detection reliability and even automating the surveillance process in the future. In this work we investigate the ability of commodity deep learning algorithms to detect marine objects in video footage from drones, with a focus on distinguishing between shark species. This study was enabled by the large archive of video footage gathered during the NSW Department of Primary Industries Drone Trials since 2016. We used this data to train two neural networks, based on the ResNet-50 and MobileNet V1 architectures, to detect and identify ten classes of marine object in 1080p resolution video footage. Both networks are capable of reliably detecting dangerous sharks: 80% accuracy for RetinaNet-50 and 78% for MobileNet V1 when tested on a challenging external dataset, which compares well to human observers. The object detection models correctly detect and localise most objects, produce few false-positive detections and can successfully distinguish between species of marine fauna in good conditions. We find that shallower network architectures, like MobileNet V1, tend to perform slightly worse on smaller objects, so care is needed when selecting a network to match deployment needs. We show that inherent biases in the training set have the largest effect on reliability. Some of these biases can be mitigated by pre-processing the data prior to training, however, this requires a large store of high resolution images that supports augmentation. A key finding is that models need to be carefully tuned for new locations and water conditions. Finally, we built an Android mobile application to run inference on real-time streaming video and demonstrated a working prototype during fields trials run in partnership with Surf Life Saving NSW."

Temporal analysis of these data series to discover behavioural patterns may lead to qualified knowledge affecting a broad range of industries. Hence, the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms over IoT data has the potential to improve safety, economy, and performance in critical processes. However, creating ML workflows at scale is a challenging task that depends upon both production and specialized skills. Such tasks require investigation, understanding, selection, and implementation of specific ML workflows, which often lead to bottlenecks, production issues, and code management complexity and even then may not have a final desirable outcome. This paper proposes the Machine Learning Framework for IoT data (ML4IoT), which is designed to orchestrate ML workflows, particularly on large volumes of data series. The ML4IoT framework enables the implementation of several types of ML models, each one with a different workflow. These models can be easily configured and used through a simple pipeline. ML4IoT has been designed to use container-based components to enable training and deployment of various ML models in parallel. The results obtained suggest that the proposed framework can manage real-world IoT heterogeneous data by providing elasticity, robustness, and performance."
