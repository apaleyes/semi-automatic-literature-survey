Majority of these changes affect Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, shifting them to a higher level of interoperability, heterogeneous networks, big data and toward internet technologies and services in general. However, this transformation does not affect all SCADA systems equally. The immediate industrial environment and controlled processes have a significant impact as well. This paper presents a holistic approach to SCADA systems implemented in continuous flow production control within the steel industry production environment. We outline the multi-layer architecture of the SCADA control framework and the aspects of interoperability and interconnectivity within the architecture reference models, together with the research challenges and opportunities arising from the recent rapid increasement of the industrial control systems complexity and digital transformation under the Industry 4.0 paradigm, resulting in disrupting levels of the traditional automation pyramid based on Purdue model toward a higher level of integration and interoperability enabling cross-level data exchange empowered by the Industrial Internet of Things. Furthermore, the paper addresses the problem of proprietary SCADA systems and elaborates the causal correlation between SCADA quality requirements and adoption of new technologies in relation to the specific industrial environment of the steel manufacturing process.",IEEE Access,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Although many studies focus on adapting ML software engineering (SE) approaches and techniques, few studies have summarized the status and challenges of operationalizing ML models. Model operationalization encompasses all steps after model training and evaluation, including packaging the model in a format appropriate for deployment, publishing to a model registry or storage, integrating the model into a broader software system, serving, and monitoring. This study is the first systematic literature review investigating the techniques, tools, and infrastructures to operationalize ML models. After reviewing 24 primary studies, the results show that there are a number of tools for most use cases to operationalize ML models and cloud deployment in particular. The review also revealed several research opportunities, such as dynamic model-switching, continuous model-monitoring, and efficient edge ML deployments.

The system implements two functions: working condition detection and remote visually reconstruction of the furnace flame. For the problem of working condition detection, we combine the image features and the smelting electrical currents to train the classifier under semi-supervised learning framework. We also introduce a highly efficient cross-entropy based optimization method for training. For the visualization task, we propose a practical end-to-end solution which can visually simulate the dynamic furnace flame at remote monitoring consoles according to the visual feature of the monitoring video. Finally, we introduce the distributed structure of the monitoring system which consists of a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The proposed solution can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry. Note to Practitioners—This paper introduces an image based solution to the practical problem of condition monitoring of fused magnesium furnace. The solution includes two parts: working condition detection and visualization. First, for the abnormal condition detection problem, most existing approaches use the process monitoring video as the condition predictor. It also assumes that the video data are fully labeled with condition category, which often is not available in practice. This paper suggests a novel approach combining the monitoring video and the smelting electrical currents under semi-supervised learning framework to the development of condition classifier. Experiments show that the detection accuracy is remarkably improved comparing to the approach using monitoring video only. Second, this paper presents a remote visualization solution which enables instant reconstruction of the furnace flame at monitoring consoles using only essential features of the flame. This technique is well suited for situation of real-time remote visual monitoring with very limited network bandwidth. Finally, the condition monitoring system adopts a distributed structure including a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The presented techniques in this paper can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry.",IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely deployed for anomaly detection in such critical infrastructures. This paper presents an Interpretable Anomaly Detection System (RX-ADS) for intrusion detection in CAN protocol communication in EVs. Contributions include: 1) window based feature extraction method; 2) deep Autoencoder based anomaly detection method; and 3) adversarial machine learning based explanation generation methodology. The presented approach was tested on two benchmark CAN datasets: OTIDS and Car Hacking. The anomaly detection performance of RX-ADS was compared against the state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets: HIDS and GIDS. The RX-ADS approach presented performance comparable to the HIDS approach (OTIDS dataset) and has outperformed HIDS and GIDS approaches (Car Hacking dataset). Further, the proposed approach was able to gener- ate explanations for detected abnormal behaviors arising from various intrusions. These explanations were later validated by information used by domain experts to detect anomalies. Other advantages of RX-ADS include: 1) the method can be trained on unlabeled data; 2) explanations help experts in understanding anomalies and root course analysis, and also help with AI model debugging and diagnostics, ultimately improving user trust in AI systems.",ArXiv,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Thus, more research to advance in the monitoring systems used to recognize the activities of elderly people is required. Many researchers have proposed different monitoring systems for activity recognition using wired and wireless wearable sensing devices. However, the activity classification accuracy achieved so far should be improved to meet the challenges of more precise activity monitoring. Our study proposes a smart Human Activity Recognition system architecture utilizing an open source dataset generated by wireless, batteryless sensors used by 14 healthy aged persons and unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we also propose using a smart grid for checking regularly the wearable sensing device operational status to address the well-known reliability challenges of these devices, such as wireless charging and data trustworthiness. As the data from the sensing device is very noisy, we employ the K-means++ clustering to identify outliers and use advanced ensemble classification techniques, such as the stacking classifier for which a meta model built using the random forest algorithm gave better results than all other base models considered. We also employ a bagging classifier, which is an ensemble meta-estimator fitting the prediction outputs of the base classifiers and aggregating them to produce the ensemble output. The best classification accuracy of 99.81 was achieved by the stacking classifier in training and 99.78% in testing, respectively.

Among the reasons hindering the development of transplantation of anatomical materials to humans in Ukraine is the rejection of donor organs by the recipient's body. The dependences of the process of rejection of donor organs by the recipient's body on the different surface structures of cells in the recipient and donor, on the incompatibility of recipient and donor on HLA antigens, on the level of dangerous antibodies in the recipient's body, on consideration of only the waiting time for the distribution of donor organs, on the origin of the donor organ (cadaveric organ or organ from a living donor), on the general health of the recipient, on the age of the donor, on the gender of the recipient, on the recipient's disease and its phase, which required transplantation, on the chosen type of immunosuppressive therapy, and on the presence of progressive chronic dysfunction of the transplanted organ. The established dependencies are useful in the selection of donor organs in order to minimize the risk of rejection of organs by the recipient. Rules and method for supporting the decision on the possibility or undesirableness of donation and transplantation, taking into account the risks of rejection of donor organs, have been developed. The architecture of the cyber-physical system for donor organs' rejection risks prevention based on donor and recipient health monitoring is developed, aimed at verifying the existing list of factors of donor organ rejection. Based on this test, the developed cyber-physical system offers a conclusion on the possibility (if all donor organ rejection factors are eliminated or minimized) or undesirableness (if one or a group of donor organ rejection factors cannot be eliminated) of donation and transplantation in a given case.",IntelITSIS,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The raw grid data requires feature extraction. Anomalies can be defined as instances or changes in the smart grid data that are out of character concerning the average trend. A typical grid architecture results can vary significantly, depending on trends or changes in power, voltage, current, or consumption. This paper develops an anomaly detection model for a real-world smart grid system implemented on a hardware-based testbed. By detecting abnormal activities, one can improve the system behavior in data communication flow. It will also identify if there are parameter changes that indicate the presence of cyber-attacks. Our proposed anomaly detection model is build based on Isolation Forest (IF) to isolate outliers from standard observations through multiple decision trees. The performance of the proposed detection method was verified using the simulation results on a hardware-based testbed.

The necessity of having an efficient, reliable, and flexible communication infrastructure is achieved by enabling real-time data exchange between numerous intelligent and traditional electrical grid elements. The performance and efficiency of the power grid are enhanced with the incorporation of communication networks, intelligent automation, advanced sensors, and information technologies. Although smart grid technologies bring about valuable economic, social, and environmental benefits, testing the combination of heterogeneous and co-existing Cyber-Physical-Smart Grids (CP-SGs) with conventional technologies presents many challenges. The examination for both hardware and software components of the Smart Grid (SG) system is essential prior to the deployment in real-time systems. This can take place by developing a prototype to mimic the real operational circumstances with adequate configurations and precision. Therefore, it is essential to summarize state-of-the-art technologies of industrial control system testbeds and evaluate new technologies and vulnerabilities with the motivation of stimulating discoveries and designs. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the advancement of CP-SGs with their corresponding testbeds including diverse testing paradigms has been performed.

However, despite the tight integration of cyber and physical components in modern critical infrastructures, the monitoring of cyber and physical subsystems is still done separately. For successful health monitoring of such systems, a holistic approach is needed. In this paper, we present an approach for holistic health monitoring of cyber-physical systems based on cyber and physical anomaly detection and correlation. We provide a data-driven approach for the detection of cyber and physical anomalies based on machine learning. The benefits of the presented approach are: 1) integrated architecture that supports acquisition and real-time analysis of both cyber and physical data; 2) a metric for holistic health monitoring that allows for differentiation between physical faults, cyber intrusion, and cyber-physical attacks.

Accurate detection and distinction between benign physical disturbances, malicious cyber-attacks, and malicious physical-attacks are necessary to protect critical infrastructure. While cyber sensors provide a useful tool to identify and mitigate cyber attacks, they often ignore the physical behavior of the system at hand. In this paper, we present a cyber-physical sensor called IREST (ICS Resilient Security Technology). The sensor takes a holistic approach in detecting anomalies by considering both cyber and physical disturbances in a complex system. The sensor was tested under different cyber-physical scenarios using the Idaho CPS SCADA Cybersecurity (ISAAC) testbed. The test scenarios capture different operational states of the CPS testbed, including various cyber and physical anomalies. The experiments show that the IREST sensor is able to detect both cyber and physical anomalies. The sensor has the benefit that training requires only normal data and is able to detect disturbances that have not been seen before.

As a consequence, many machine learning methods (MLMs) have been modified to provide the best results for early diagnosis of this malignancy. Machine learning methods (MLMs) offer several beneficial implications in breast cancer, including early prognosis, detection, and diagnosis. Compared to traditional statistical analysis, machine learning methods (MLMs) have the capacity to improve the analysis of various health data, such as unstructured, complicated, and noisy data. With the demanding prevalence of breast cancer and the arrival of “data reformation,” it is thus imperative to mention the ethical consequences of machine learning (ML) on society and cancer care. It offers conclusively strong tools, smart methods, and efficient algorithms that can help in the prognosis of breast cancer. The focus of this review is on supervised techniques such as classification and regression that may be implemented and used for breast cancer data analysis. Some supervised learning methods like Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and support vector machine are presented in this work in the early identification of breast cancer. These algorithms have been analyzed for their accuracy and efficiency using various assessment metrics and methods.",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

On one hand, in medicine, automated systems can detect several diseases. On the other hand, they are also involved in the treatment process. Specialized systems can recommend medication, taking into consideration the side effects, give lifestyle suggestions (e.g., sleep, physical exercises), and even indicate to the patients which medics should they go to. One of the main advantages of the automated systems is the ability to process large volumes of data, at higher rates than the human experts. The data may be represented as text, images, or sounds. In this paper, we approach the treatment subject, and focus on data represented as text.

In the recent years there have been significant advances in face recognition by using deep neural networks. One of the potential next steps is to develop optimized 3D facial recognition. Shifting from 2D to 3D increases complexity of the problem by adding an- other dimension to data, making possible solutions more resource hungry. We will investigate different depth camera based facial recognition techniques and test their performance by deploying them on an embedded processor. We focus on applications for embedded systems and use a small low-resolution time of flight (ToF) camera with our system to keep overall system portable and compact. All faces images are then projected on the feature space (“face space”) to find the corresponding coordinators. The face space is composed of “Eigenfaces” or “Fisherfaces” which are actually eigenvectors found after doing a matrix composition - Eigen decomposition. At the heart of Eigenface method is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms - while Fisherface is a better version of the previous one which makes use of both Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) to get more reliable results. The algorithms were realized by Python in Anaconda. Given initial images in the database, the program can detect and recognize the human faces in the provided pictures before saving them in the database to improve the calculation accuracy in the future.

DL learns from unlabeled data and extracts features from raw data, as for the case of time-series acceleration. Sliding windows is a feature extraction technique. When used for preprocessing time-series data, it provides an improvement in accuracy, latency, and cost of processing. The time and cost of preprocessing can be beneficial especially if the window size is small, but how small can this window be to keep good accuracy? The objective of this research was to analyze the performance of four DL models: a simple deep neural network (DNN); a convolutional neural network (CNN); a long short-term memory network (LSTM); and a hybrid model (CNN-LSTM), when variating the sliding window size using fixed overlapped windows to identify an optimal window size for HAR. We compare the effects in two acceleration sources’: wearable inertial measurement unit sensors (IMU) and motion caption systems (MOCAP). Moreover, short sliding windows of sizes 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 frames to long ones of sizes 50, 75, 100, and 200 frames were compared. The models were fed using raw acceleration data acquired in experimental conditions for three activities: walking, sit-to-stand, and squatting. Results show that the most optimal window is from 20–25 frames (0.20–0.25s) for both sources, providing an accuracy of 99,07% and F1-score of 87,08% in the (CNN-LSTM) using the wearable sensors data, and accuracy of 98,8% and F1-score of 82,80% using MOCAP data; similar accurate results were obtained with the LSTM model. There is almost no difference in accuracy in larger frames (100, 200). However, smaller windows present a decrease in the F1-score. In regard to inference time, data with a sliding window of 20 frames can be preprocessed around 4x (LSTM) and 2x (CNN-LSTM) times faster than data using 100 frames.",PeerJ Comput.

Ambient assisted living (AAL) entails monitoring a patient’s health to ensure their well-being. However, ensuring a limit on transmission delays is an essential requirement of such monitoring systems. The uplink (UL) transmission during the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in the wireless local area networks (WLANs) can incur a delay which may not be acceptable for delay-sensitive applications such as H-IoT due to their random nature. Therefore, we propose a UL OFDMA scheduler for the next Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) standard, the IEEE 802.11be, that is compliant with the latency requirements for healthcare applications. The scheduler allocates the channel resources for UL transmission taking into consideration the traffic class or access category. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduler can achieve the required latency for H-IoT applications.

 BACKGROUND
 Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a common name for various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-infused applications and platforms that support their users in need in multiple activities, from health to daily living. These systems use different approaches to learn about their users and make automated decisions, known as AI models, for personalizing their services and increasing outcomes. Given the numerous systems developed and deployed for people with different needs, health conditions, and dispositions towards the technology, it is critical to obtain clear and comprehensive insights concerning AI models employed, along with their domains, technology, and concerns, to identify promising directions for future work.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 This study provides a scoping review of the literature on AI models in AAL. In particular, we analyze: 1) specific AI models employed in AАL systems, 2) the target domains of the models, 3) the technology using the models, and 4) the major concerns from the end-user perspective. Our goal is to consolidate research on the topic and inform end-users, healthcare professionals and providers, researchers, and practitioners in developing, deploying, and evaluating future intelligent AAL systems.
 
 
 METHODS
 The study was conducted as a scoping review to identify, analyze and extract the relevant literature. It used a natural language processing (NLP) toolkit to retrieve the article corpus for an efficient and comprehensive automated literature search. The relevant articles were then extracted from the corpus and analyzed manually. The review included five digital libraries: the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), PubMed, Springer, Elsevier, and the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI).
 
 
 RESULTS
 The annual distribution of relevant articles shows a growing trend for all categories from January 2010 to November 2021. The AI models started with unsupervised approaches as the leader, followed by deep learning (dominant from 2020), instance-based learning, and supervised techniques. Activity recognition and assistance were the most common target domains of the models. Ambient sensing, wearable, and mobile technologies mainly implemented the models. Older adults were primary beneficiaries, followed by patients and frail persons of various ages. Availability was a top beneficiary concern, and to less extent, reliability, safety, privacy, and security.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 The study presents the analytical evidence of AI models in AAL and their domains, technologies, beneficiaries, and concerns. Future research on intelligent AAL should: involve healthcare professionals and caregivers as designers and users, comply with health-related regulation, improve transparency and privacy, integrate with healthcare technological infrastructure, explain their decisions to the users, and establish evaluation metrics and design guidelines.

First, it presents and discusses a comprehensive comparative study, where 19 different machine learning methods were used to develop fall detection systems, to deduce the optimal machine learning method for the development of such systems. This study was conducted on two different datasets, and the results show that out of all the machine learning methods, the k-NN classifier is best suited for the development of fall detection systems in terms of performance accuracy. Second, it presents a framework that overcomes the limitations of binary classifier-based fall detection systems by being able to detect falls and fall-like motions. Third, to increase the trust and reliance on fall detection systems, it introduces a novel methodology based on the usage of k-folds cross-validation and the AdaBoost algorithm that improves the performance accuracy of the k-NN classifier-based fall detection system to the extent that it outperforms all similar works in this field. This approach achieved performance accuracies of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively, when evaluated on the two datasets. Finally, the proposed approach is also highly accurate in detecting the activity of standing up from a lying position to infer whether a fall was followed by a long lie, which can cause minor to major health-related concerns. The above contributions address multiple research challenges in the field of fall detection, that we identified after conducting a comprehensive review of related works, which is also presented in this paper.",J.

To do this, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN-) based fall detection method using a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer. Acquiring fall data compared with normal behavioral data can be an arduous process. Instead, we introduce a compelling GAN-based anomaly detection partially surrounded with User Initial information features (UI-GAN). Although GAN-based anomaly detection methods have been previously proposed, each model has its adequate suitability for each anomaly detection application. Therefore, this study firstly evaluates suitable GAN-based anomaly detection models for fall detection from among nine recently proposed GAN-based models. From UI-GAN, performance improvements are observed in the fall detection when using the UI information. To objectively demonstrate the competitive performance of UI-GAN, we compare it with eight other recently presented fall detection studies and have observed that it leads to better results. Lastly, since the target application in this study is the use of UI-GAN with a wearable device, the sufficiently satisfied latency of UI-GAN on the smartwatch is estimated. This study is the first attempt to use the initial information of users in GAN, and we hope that the effectiveness of the UI information is expected to be seen in other applications.",IEEE Sensors Journal,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.",Electronics,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

To overcome this trouble, we have used cloud computing at the side of Internet of Things. Using Internet of Things, you may access extra wide variety of data at anytime from anywhere since the information are stored in the cloud. The sensors used will continuously sense the information and store it to the cloud. When the sensed value exceeds the threshold limit the buzzer will operate and the information will be displayed in the LCD. The IoT also helps to send this information to as many persons required by the industry to monitor and control it. This can help us to get right of entry to the statistic’s time whenever it is required for quality checking.",International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, interface incompatibilities and performance limitations often compel users to either transfer data between a file system and object storage or use inefficient file connectors over object stores. The result is growing storage sprawl, unacceptably low performance, and an increase in associated storage costs. One promising solution to this problem is providing dual access, the ability to transparently read and write the same data through both file system interfaces and object storage APIs. In this position paper we argue that there is a need for dual-access file systems over object storage, and examine some representative use cases which benefit from such systems. Based on our conversations with end users, we discuss features which we believe are essential or desirable in a dual-access object storage file system (OSFS). Further, we design and implement an early prototype of Agni1, an efficient dual-access OSFS which overcomes the shortcomings of existing approaches. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that for some representative workloads Agni can improve performance by 20%–60% compared to either S3FS, a popular OSFS, or the prevalent approach of manually copying data between different storage systems.",HotStorage,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In machine automation systems, any additional computing hardware can be cumbersome to install, making upgrades hard to apply. This paper presents a cloud-extended sensor network with supervisory control in a public cloud. The hardware and cloud resources used in the solution are low-cost, reducing the up-front costs compared to the use of high-end components. The system collects data from ST microprocessor (STM)-based sensor nodes that send inertial measurement data using user datagram protocol (UDP). The sensor itself is a Bosch BMI160, a cheap and small inertial measurement unit (IMU). The system is designed to be used in machine automation applications where the frequency of the sensory data produced is hundreds of hertz. The system is to provide low-latency data transfer to the cloud. In the cloud environment, data is collected by a computing service that can be programmed to perform algorithms on it. The system is tested in a setup consisting of five IMU sensors and an angle measurement unit attached to a hydraulically actuated flexible beam. The test setup aims to update a local control system's parameters based on a cloud algorithm and camera measurements of the beam tip position. The control results and communication latency are inspected. The main advantages of the proposed solution are the simple system architecture and cost savings with the use of low-cost sensors and cloud resources. The focus of this study is the functionality of such a system; intricate security issues are beyond the scope of this study.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS) and IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM)",2017,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

When the UAV schedules an IoT device to offload its computation task, the tasks buffered at the other unselected devices could be outdated and have to be canceled. We investigate a new joint optimization of UAV cruise control and task offloading allocation, which maximizes tasks offloaded to the UAV, subject to the IoT device’s computation capacity and battery budget, and the UAV’s speed limit. Since the optimization contains a large solution space while the instantaneous network states are unknown to the UAV, we propose a new deep-graph-based reinforcement learning framework. An advantage actor–critic (A2C) structure is developed to train the real-time continuous actions of the UAV in terms of the flight speed, heading, and the offloading schedule of the IoT device. By exploring hidden representations resulting from the network feature correlation, our framework takes advantage of graph neural networks (GNNs) to supervise the training of UAV’s actions in A2C. The proposed graph neural network-enabled A2C (GNN-A2C) framework is implemented with Google Tensorflow. The performance analysis shows that GNN-A2C achieves fast convergence and reduces considerably the task missing rate in aerial EdgeIoT.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2022.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Accurate commercial soil moisture sensors often require manual data collection and cost thousands of dollars, which makes data collection inefficient and only accessible to high-budget smart farms. To achieve cost-effective and high-efficient soil moisture sensing, we propose a millimeterwave (mmWave) radar-based method, which can obtain the soil moisture from the propagation time and Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the reflected signals received at multiple antennas. Our method only requires a single Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mmWave radar to automatically estimate the soil moisture level.

In Colombia, agriculture is of great importance not only as a commercial activity, but also as a source of food and employment. However, the concept of smart agriculture has not been widely applied in this country, resulting in the high production of various types of crops due to the planting of large areas of land, rather than optimization of the processes involved in the activity. Due to its technical characteristics and the radio spectrum considered in its deployment, 5G can be seen as one of the technologies that could generate the greatest benefits for the Colombian agricultural sector, especially in the most remote rural areas, which currently lack mobile network coverage. This article provides an overview of the current 5G technology landscape in Colombia and presents examples of possible 5G/IoT applications that could be developed in Colombian fields. The results show that 5G could facilitate the implementation of the smart farm in Colombia, improving current production and efficiency.

To date, among many solutions, the circular economy is the one prevailing. A successful transition toward a circular economy (CE) requires the food sector to overcome the challenges of today’s complex food supply chains such as information asymmetry, poor cooperation among stakeholders, and concerns about food safety. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, has been progressively gaining traction in supply chains in areas like data management, certifying product provenance and tracking products. Despite its importance, knowledge around the potential of the blockchain technology in facilitating the transition towards a circular economy in the agri-food sector is fragmented.

Most of these countries suffer from insufficient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable and farm-specific information may significantly contribute to more sufficient and sustained production. Typically, such information is usually fragmented and often does fit one-on-one with the farm or farm plot. Automated, precise and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal variability. The Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are useful technology in this respect. This paper investigates the usability of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications.

The Internet of Things (IoT) may serve as an enabler to ensure key properties—such as interconnectivity, scalability, agility, and interoperability—in IFM systems so that they could provide object-based services while adapting to dynamic changes. This paper focuses on the problem of facilitating the management, processing, and sharing of the vast and heterogeneous data points generated in livestock facilities by introducing distributed IoT middleware as the core of a responsive and adaptive service-oriented IFM system, specifically targeted to enable smart livestock farming in view of its unique requirements. The proposed IoT middleware encompasses the context-awareness approach via the integration of a flexible ontology-based structure for modeling and reasoning. The IoT middleware was assessed in actual conditions on the grounds of a case study for smart control of the thermal environment in a medium-sized pig farming facility. As derived from the obtained evaluation results, the system appears to perform quite satisfactorily in terms of computational performance as well as ontology coherence, consistency, and efficiency.",Agronomy,2022.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Every living being on the earth is being affected due to Global warming. It gives rise to many problems like melting the icecaps, expanding ocean levels, evaporating water bodies, and increasing the average temperature. Deforestation is the primary factor of global warming. Deforestation has a significant impact on biodiversity in various ways. Afforestation is the only key to lessening global warming. Since the population of cities is more and the majority of those living in cities are too busy earning their lives, it is difficult for them to find more places as land is scarce and they have no time to do plantation. This manuscript aims at an IoT-based plant monitoring device for the healthy growth of the plant. The designed system mentioned here does the tasks like taking care of the plant and preventing environmental changes and other damage. An additional concept here is the usage of sentiment analysis, which communicates the state of the plant directly to the user's mobile phone so that the user may visit his field based on the necessity. This method can enhance the plantation process in cities, which increases greenery and helps in minimizing global warming.

The aim is to identify the service areas of agriculture where blockchain is used, the blockchain technology used, the data stored in it, its combination with external databases, the reason it is used, and the variety of agricultural products, as well as the level of maturity of the respective approaches. The study follows the PRISMA-ScR methodology. The purpose of conducting these scoping reviews is to identify the evidence in this field and clarify the key concepts. The literature search was conducted in April 2021 using Scopus and Google Scholar, and a systematic selection process identified 104 research articles for detailed study. Our findings show that in the field, although still in the early stages, with the majority of the studies in the design phase, several experiments have been conducted, so a significant percentage of the work is in the implementation or piloting phase. Finally, our research shows that the use of blockchain in this domain mainly concerns the integrity of agricultural production records, the monitoring of production steps, and the monitoring of products.

The best available techniques (BATs) that are suggested by the integrated environmental permit system (IEPS) play a pivotal role in providing state-of-the-art approaches and techniques to workplaces. For the workplaces that install facilities with the BATs, it is necessary to perform real-time monitoring to determine whether pollutant emission facilities and treatment facilities are operating normally and whether such facilities can maintain the optimal condition during the emission of pollutants. The environmental management measures used before the IEPS had limitations for workplaces that are subjected to integrated environmental management because they consider the entire workplace as a single pollution source by combining all media. In addition, only the emission concentrations and amounts of pollutants were monitored because only the points at which most pollutants are discharged, i.e., stacks for air pollutant emission facilities and final effluent outlets for water pollutant emission facilities, are monitored. These monitoring approaches in a variety of facilities involve considerable costs, and most of them (95% for stacks in workplaces under IEPS, Korea) cannot perform real-time observation even though some of them are capable of it (5% for stacks managed by Tele Monitoring System, TMS). In this study, the applicability of a wireless sensor monitoring network was examined as a new approach for environmental management in workplaces. Based on the sensor monitoring network, surrogate parameters that can indirectly monitor the critical operating factors of pollutant emission and prevention facilities were developed and then measured in real time to examine the status of these facilities. Surrogate parameters can be used instead of directly measuring pollutants as the former has high efficiency, such as cost reduction, and can provide reliable data on the emission characteristics of pollutants. The wireless network is based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform under real-time conditions in the emission and production facilities in a workplace. This study suggested that a wireless network using the IoT platform improves the BAT assessment methodology to understand the efficiency of environmental pollution reduction and the economic contribution to the workplace.",Sustainability,2021.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a data-driven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC.",Sensors,2021.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In this paper, based on deep learning, we provide a mechanism to quickly detect anomalies of multiple equipment (environmental sensors and controllers, etc.) in each pig house at the same time. In particular, environmental factors (temperature, humidity, CO2, ventilation, radiator temperature, external temperature, etc.) to be used for learning were extracted through the analysis of data accumulated for the generation of predictive models of each equipment. In addition, the optimal recurrent neural network (RNN) environment was derived by analyzing the characteristics of the learning RNN. In this way, the accuracy of the prediction model can be improved. In this paper, the real-time input data (only in the case of temperature) was intentionally induced above the threshold, and 93% of the abnormalities were detected to determine whether the equipment was abnormal.",Electronics,2021.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Twenty-first century agricultural producers will be facing the challenge of achieving food security and efficiency. This must be achieved while ensuring sustainable agricultural systems and overcoming the problems posed by climate change, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion and loss of productivity due to extreme weather conditions. Those environmental consequences will directly affect the price setting process. In view of the price oscillations and the lack of transparent information for buyers, a multi-agent system (MAS) is presented in this article. It supports the making of decisions in the purchase of sustainable agricultural products. The proposed MAS consists of a system that supports decision-making when choosing a supplier on the basis of certain preference-based parameters aimed at measuring the sustainability of a supplier and a deep Q-learning agent for agricultural future market price forecast. Therefore, different agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) have been considered, as well as the use of edge computing technologies to reduce costs of data transfer to the cloud. The presented MAS combines price setting optimizations and user preferences in regards to accessing, filtering, and integrating information. The agents filter and fuse information relevant to a user according to supplier attributes and a dynamic environment. The results presented in this paper allow a user to choose the supplier that best suits their preferences as well as to gain insight on agricultural future markets price oscillations through a deep Q-learning agent.",Sensors,2021.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Automated crop disease detection is a major issue in the current agricultural industry due to its cluttered background. Internet of Things (IoT) has gained immense interest in the past decade, as it accumulates a high level of contextual information to identify crop diseases. This study paper presents a novel method based on Taylor‐Water Wave Optimization‐based Generative Adversarial Network (Taylor‐WWO‐based GAN) to identify diseases in the agricultural industry. In this method, the IoT nodes sense the plant leaves, and the sensed data are transmitted to the Base Station (BS) using Fractional Gravitational Gray Wolf Optimization. This technique selects the optimal path for data transmission. After performing IoT routing, crop diseases are recognized at the BS. For detecting crop disease, the input image acquired from the IoT routing phase is then forwarded to the next step, that is, preprocessing, to improve the quality of the image for further processing. Then, Segmentation Network (SegNet) is adapted to segment the images, and extraction of significant features is performed using the acquired segments. The extracted features are adapted by the GAN, which is trained by Taylor‐WWO. The proposed Taylor‐WWO is newly devised by integrating the Taylor series and WWO algorithms. The proposed Taylor‐WWO‐based GAN showed improved performance with a maximum accuracy of 91.6%, maximum sensitivity of 89.3%, and maximum specificity of 92.3% in comparison with existing methods.",Int.

Managing the supply of animal protein required hunter gatherer communities to be able to domesticate and contain wild animals. Over the ages the fence has become ingrained in the very fabric of society and created a culture of control and ownership. Garett Hardin's article titled “The Tragedy of the Commons” suggested that shared land, typified by access to a fenceless common resource, was doomed to failure due to a human instinct for mistrust and exploitation. Perhaps the fence has created an ingrained societal cultural response. While natural ecosystems do have physical boundaries, these are based on natural environmental zones. Landscapes are more porous and resilience is built up through animal's being able to respond to dynamic changes. This paper explores the opportunity for remote monitoring technologies to create open fenceless landscapes and how this might be integrated into the growing need for humans to access animal protein.",Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2021.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The change is being propagated into the wave of transforming the existing system with a vertical structure into the corresponding horizontal platform or middleware. Accordingly, the way of acquiring IIoT data from an individual system is being altered to the way of being increasingly centralized through an integrated middleware of a scalable server or through a large platform. That said, middleware-based IIoT data acquisition must consider multiple factors, such as infrastructure (e.g., operation environment and network), protocol heterogeneity, interoperability (e.g., links with legacy systems), real-time, and security. This manuscript explains these five aspects in detail and provides a taxonomy of eighteen state-of-the-art IIoT data-acquisition middleware systems based on these aspects. To validate one of these aspects (network), we present our evaluation results at a real production site where IIoT data-acquisition loss rates are compared between wireless (long-term evolution) and wired networks. As a result, the wired communication can be more suitable for centralized IIoT data-acquisition middleware than wireless networks.

There are a number of reasons for this limited expansion of technologies for pastured animals, including networking availability and reliability, power requirements, and expense, among others. The objective of this work was to demonstrate a rapidly deployable long-range radio (LoRa) based, low-cost sensor suite that can be used to track location and activity of pastured livestock. The sensor is comprised of an inexpensive Arduino-compatible microprocessor, a generic MPU-9250 motion sensor which contains a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer, and a 3-axis gyroscope, a generic GPS receiver, and a RFM95W generic LoRa radio. The microprocessor can be programmed flexibly using the open source Arduino IDE software to adjust the frequency of sampling, the data packet to send, and what conditions are needed to operate. The LoRa radio transmits to a Dragino LoRa gateway which can also be flexibly programmed through the Arduino IDE software to send data to local storage or, in cases where a web or cellular connection is available, to cloud storage. The sensor was powered using a USB cord connected to a 3,350 mAh lithium-ion battery pack. The Dragino gateway was programmed to upload data to the ThingSpeak IoT application programming interface for data storage, handling, and visualization. Evaluations showed minimal benefit associated with reducing sampling frequency as a strategy to preserve battery life. Packet loss ranged from 40% to 60%. In a 3 d evaluation on pastured sheep, the sensor suite was able to report GPS locations, inertial sensor readings, and temperature.

Considering the hetero-geneity of the transaction data and the IoT data, the openness of sustainability information and the sensitivity of participants’ data, a double-chain structure is proposed including the consensus method, the transaction mechanisms, the sustainability assessment method and the performance optimization strategy. The sustainable management practices of all participants are introduced into the blockchain network, especially those allowing the government to play a more significant role in agriculture supply management. Meanwhile, to meet the scenario requirements, a data reduction method is designed to improve performance and reduce block size.

This industry needs to adapt to the current market through an efficient use of resources while being environmentally friendly. The most commonly used approaches for analyzing efficiency and sustainability on farms are production efficiency based analyses, such as Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis, since they allow to see how efficient the outputs are generated regardless of the units of measurement of the inputs. This work presents a real scenario for making farms more profitable and sustainable through the analysis of the Data Envelopment Analysis and the application of the Internet of Things and Edge Computing. What makes this model interesting is that it allows monitoring the ambient conditions with real-time data from the different sensors that have been installed on the farm, minimizing costs and gaining robustness in the transmission of the data to the cloud with Edge Computing, and then to have a complete overview in terms of monthly resource efficiency through the Data Envelopment Analysis. The results show that including the costs of edge and non-edge data transfer have an impact on the efficiency.

Due to the requirements of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters. The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches. We have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks.

The combination of immutability, enhanced visibility, transparency and data integrity provides numerous benefits that improve trust in extended food supply chains (FSCs). Blockchain can enhance traceability, enable more efficient recall and aids in risk reduction of counterfeits and other forms of illicit trade. Moreover, blockchain can enhance the integrity of credence claims such as sustainably sourced, organic or faith-based claims such as kosher or halal by integrating the authoritative source of the claim (e.g., the certification body or certification owner) into the blockchain to verify the claim integrity and reassure business customers and end consumers.

Dairy farmers implement a wide range of sensors, which create large amounts of data, in farming. Therefore, they offer an interesting area for data-driven research. In this review, we show how ML methods have already been used in the scientific literature and describe the potential that these may offer for the future. We found that ML methods were applied to predict data in a variety of areas in dairy farming such as milk yield or energy consumption; however, larger integrated datasets are required to improve the reliability of the algorithms developed. Abstract Dairy farmers use herd management systems, behavioral sensors, feeding lists, breeding schedules, and health records to document herd characteristics. Consequently, large amounts of dairy data are becoming available. However, a lack of data integration makes it difficult for farmers to analyze the data on their dairy farm, which indicates that these data are currently not being used to their full potential. Hence, multiple issues in dairy farming such as low longevity, poor performance, and health issues remain. We aimed to evaluate whether machine learning (ML) methods can solve some of these existing issues in dairy farming. This review summarizes peer-reviewed ML papers published in the dairy sector between 2015 and 2020. Ultimately, 97 papers from the subdomains of management, physiology, reproduction, behavior analysis, and feeding were considered in this review. The results confirm that ML algorithms have become common tools in most areas of dairy research, particularly to predict data. Despite the quantity of research available, most tested algorithms have not performed sufficiently for a reliable implementation in practice. This may be due to poor training data. The availability of data resources from multiple farms covering longer periods would be useful to improve prediction accuracies. In conclusion, ML is a promising tool in dairy research, which could be used to develop and improve decision support for farmers. As the cow is a multifactorial system, ML algorithms could analyze integrated data sources that describe and ultimately allow managing cows according to all relevant influencing factors. However, both the integration of multiple data sources and the obtainability of public data currently remain challenging.",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2020.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Location estimation can be affected by factors such as node density, topological diversity, and sensor coverage. As such, we propose a hybrid approach using multistage collaborative calibration for wireless sensor network localization, specifically in 3D environments. This technique integrates a Modified version of Light Gradient Boosting Model (MLGB), which is based on a regression scheme, a cooperative methodology, and a fine calibration model for collaborative fusion. These techniques were combined with quadrilateral shrunk centroid (QSC) and distance vector hop algorithms, using a multi-communication radius and an improved frog-leaping algorithm (DVMFL). In the first step, MLGB was used to correct for inhomogeneous localization estimation errors and RSSI data sparsity. As a result, the model is capable of adapting to high topological diversity (i.e., C-shape, H-shape, S-shape, and O-shape).Successive steps further improved prediction accuracy by using a screening cooperative anchor node strategy to increase node density and enhance the QSC-DVMFL fusion framework for fine position estimation. The proposed methodology was assessed in a series of validation, comparing it to other techniques. The results demonstrated a clear effectiveness and adaptability across a variety of factors that typically affect WSN localization.",IEEE Access,2020.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The purpose of this review is to discuss the digitalization of animal farming with Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, specifically biosensors, big data, and block chain technology. Biosensors are noninvasive or invasive sensors that monitor an animal’s health and behavior in real time, allowing farmers to monitor individual animals and integrate this data for population-level analyses. The data from the sensors is processed using big data-processing techniques such as data modelling. These technologies use algorithms to sort through large, complex data sets to provide farmers with biologically relevant and usable data. Blockchain technology allows for traceability of animal products from farm to table, a key advantage in monitoring disease outbreaks and preventing related economic losses and food-related health pandemics. With these PLF technologies, animal agriculture can become more transparent and regain consumer trust. While the digitalization of animal farming has the potential to address a number of pressing concerns, these technologies are relatively new. The implementation of PLF technologies on farms will require increased collaboration between farmers, animal scientists, and engineers to ensure that technologies can be used in realistic, on-farm conditions. These technologies will call for data models that can sort through large amounts of data while accounting for specific variables and ensuring automation, accessibility, and accuracy of data. Issues with data privacy, security, and integration will need to be addressed before there can be multi-farm databases. Lastly, the usage of blockchain technology in animal agriculture is still in its infancy; blockchain technology has the potential to improve the traceability and transparency of animal products, but more research is needed to realize its full potential.

This challenge is even more complicated when edge intelligent devices are involved in the process. The low-quality image having challenges such as blur, low resolution, and contrast make it more difficult for text detection and classification. Therefore, such exigent aspect is considered in the study. The technology proposed is comprised of three main contributions. (a) After synthetic blurring, the blurred image is preprocessed, and then the deblurring process is applied to recover the image. (b) Subsequently, the standard maximal stable extreme regions (MSER) technique is applied to localize and detect text. Soon after, K-Means is applied to get three different clusters of the query image to separate foreground and background and also incorporate character level grouping. (c) Finally, the segmented text is classified into textual and non-textual regions using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. The purpose of this task is to overcome the false positives. For evaluation of proposed technique, results are obtained on three mainstream datasets, including SVT, IIIT5K and ICDAR 2003.

The development of those models is driven by world capitals, companies, and universities. Their purpose is to make the electric power system more efficient through distributed energy generation/storage, smart meter installation, or reduction of consumption/implementation costs. This work approaches Smart Energy as a paradigm that is concerned with systemic strategies involving the implementation of innovative technological developments in energy systems. However, many of the challenges encountered under this paradigm are yet to be overcome, such as the effective integration of solutions within Smart Energy systems. Edge Computing is included in this new technology group. Objective: To investigate developments that involve the use of Edge Computing and that provide solutions to Smart Energy problems. The research work will be developed using the methodology of systematic mapping of literature, following the guidelines established by Kitchenham and Petersen that facilitate the identification of studies published on the subject. Results: Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied to identify the relevant articles. We selected 80 papers that were classified according to the type of publication (journal, conferences, or book chapter), type of research (conceptual, experience, or validation), type of activity (implement, validate, analyze) and asset (architecture, framework, method, or models). Conclusion: A complete review has been conducted of the 80 articles that were closely related to the questions posed in this research. To reach the goal of building Edge Computing architectures for Smart Energy environments, several lines of research have been defined.

In the COVID 19 pandemic, the elderly have been seriously affected in addition to suffering from isolation and its associated and psychological consequences. This paper provides an overview of the RobWell (Robotic-based Well-Being Monitoring and Coaching System for the Elderly in their Daily Activities) system. It is a system focused on the field of artificial intelligence for mood prediction and coaching. This paper presents a general overview of the initially proposed system as well as the preliminary results related to the home automation subsystem, autonomous robot navigation and mood estimation through machine learning prior to the final system integration, which will be discussed in future works. The main goal is to improve their mental well-being during their daily household activities. The system is composed of ambient intelligence with intelligent sensors, actuators and a robotic platform that interacts with the user. A test smart home system was set up in which the sensors, actuators and robotic platform were integrated and tested. For artificial intelligence applied to mood prediction, we used machine learning to classify several physiological signals into different moods. In robotics, it was concluded that the ROS autonomous navigation stack and its autodocking algorithm were not reliable enough for this task, while the robot’s autonomy was sufficient.

Part of this is due to the use of incompatible communication hardware, and part is due to the entrenched proprietary systems. This has created a heterogeneous communication landscape, where it is difficult for devices to coordinate their efforts. To remedy this, a number of IoT Frameworks have been proposed to provide a common interface between IoT devices. There are many approaches to common frameworks, each with their strengths and weaknesses, but there is no clear winner among them. This thesis presents a virtual network testbed for implementing smart home IoT Frameworks. It consists of a simulated home network made up of multiple Virtual Machines (VM), simulated smart home devices and an implementation of the OpenHAB framework to integrate the devices. Simulated devices are designed to be networkaccurate representations of actual devices, a LIFX smart lightbulb was developed and an existing Nest thermostat simulation was integrated. The demonstrated setup serves as a proof of concept for the idea of a home network testbed. Such a testbed could allow for the development of new IoT frameworks or the comparison of existing ones, and it could also serve as an education aid to illustrate how smart home IoT devices communicate with one another.

DHT structures arise as the most commonly used organizations for peers that can efficiently perform crucial services such as data storage, replication, query resolution, and load balancing. With the advances in various distributed system technologies, novel and efficient solutions based on DHTs emerge and play critical roles in system design. DHT-based methods and communications have been proposed to address challenges such as scalability, availability, reliability and performance, by considering unique characteristics of these technologies. In this article, we propose a classification of the state-of-the-art DHT-based methods focusing on their system architecture, communication, routing and technological aspects across various system domains. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey on DHT-based applications from system architecture and communication perspectives that spans various domains of recent distributed system technologies. We investigate the recently emerged DHT-based solutions in the seven key domains of edge and fog computing, cloud computing, blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), Online Social Networks (OSNs), Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In contrast to the existing surveys, our study goes beyond the commonly known DHT methods such as storage, routing, and lookup, and identifies diverse DHT-based solutions including but not limited to aggregation, task scheduling, resource management and discovery, clustering and group management, federation, data dependency management, and data transmission.

Edge Intelligence, which brings together the fields of AI and Edge computing, is a key enabling technology for smart services. Trustworthy Edge Intelligence should thus be a priority research concern. However, determining what makes Edge Intelligence trustworthy is not straight forward. This paper examines requirements for trustworthy Edge Intelligence in a concrete application scenario of voice-activated services. We contribute to deepening the understanding of trustworthiness in the emerging Edge Intelligence domain in three ways: firstly, we propose a unified framing for trustworthy Edge Intelligence that jointly considers trustworthiness attributes of AI and the IoT. Secondly, we present research outputs of a tangible case study in voice-activated services that demonstrates interdependencies between three important trustworthiness attributes: privacy, security and fairness.

These systems not only collect basic data about individuals but, in most cases, very sensitive data like their movements, spatio-temporal activities, travel history, visits to churches/clubs, purchases, and social interactions. While collection and utilization of person-specific data in different contexts is essential to limiting the spread of COVID-19, it increases the chances of privacy breaches and personal data misuse. Recently, many privacy protection techniques (PPTs) have been proposed based on the person-specific data included in different data types (e.g., tables, graphs, matrixes, barcodes, and geospatial data), and epidemic containment strategies (ECSs) (contact tracing, quarantine monitoring, symptom reports, etc.) in order to minimize privacy breaches and to permit only the intended uses of such personal data. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the PPTs that have been recently proposed to address the diverse privacy requirements/concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe the heterogeneous types of data collected to control this pandemic, and the corresponding PPTs, as well as the paradigm shifts in personal data handling brought on by this pandemic. We systemically map the recently proposed PPTs into various ECSs and data lifecycle phases, and present an in-depth review of existing PPTs and evaluation metrics employed for analysis of their suitability. We describe various PPTs developed during the COVID-19 period that leverage emerging technologies, such as federated learning, blockchain, privacy by design, and swarm learning, to name a few. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of preserving individual privacy during a pandemic, the role of privacy regulations/laws, and promising future research directions.

It also involves stochastic approaches to help in developing enhanced watershed modeling. Cancer diseases, primarily the brain tumor, have been exponentially raised which has alarmed researchers from academia and industry. Nowadays, researchers need to attain a more effective, accurate, and trustworthy brain tumor tissue detection and classification approach. Different from traditional machine learning methods that are just targeting to enhance classification efficiency, this work highlights the process to extract several deep features to diagnose brain tumor effectively. This paper explains the modeling of a novel technique by integrating the modified ResNet50 with the Enhanced Watershed Segmentation (EWS) algorithm for brain tumor classification and deep feature extraction. The proposed model uses the ResNet50 model with a modified layer architecture including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The proposed method can retain the optimal computational efficiency with high-dimensional deep features. This work obtains a comprised feature set by retrieving the diverse deep features from the ResNet50 deep learning model and feeds them as input to the classifier. The good performing capability of the proposed model is achieved by using hybrid features of ResNet50. The brain tumor tissue images were extracted by the suggested hybrid deep feature-based modified ResNet50 model and the EWS-based modified ResNet50 model with a high classification accuracy of 92% and 90%, respectively.",BioMed research international,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The expansion of healthy life expectations is progressively significant due to the speedy aging of the world population. The patient requires early and home-based treatment to detect and prevent disease on time and with less effort. Home-based health monitoring has been considered the need of a smart home. The services of health monitoring can facilitate the patient by collecting and analyzing the data of health for tackling diverse complex issues of health at a large scale. Health monitoring is a sustainable progression of clinical trials for ensuring that health is monitored according to the defined protocol and standard operating procedures. Various scenarios can be considered for monitoring health and are performed through experts of the field.

In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of Open Virtual Tap (OVT), a software-defined solution to replace hardware taps for traffic monitoring in OpenFlow virtual networks by utilizing mirroring capabilities of OpenFlow switches. The key idea behind OVT is the joint configuration of all switches in the substrate physical network in order to efficiently mirror flows from all virtual networks. We show that such a design avoids inefficiencies that result from existing software-based traffic mirroring solutions in which each virtual network configures its own switches independently of other virtual networks. We evaluate OVT using model-driven simulations as well as Mininet experiments with realistic applications for intrusion detection and video telephony analysis. Specifically, in our experiments, we observe that OVT can achieve up to 20% improvement in flow coverage compared to existing traffic mirroring approaches.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

By exploiting widely distributed computing infrastructure that is located closer to the network edge, communication cost and service response time can be significantly reduced. However, developing this class of applications is not straightforward and requires addressing three key challenges, ie, supporting the dynamic nature of the edge network, managing the context‐dependent characteristics of application logic, and dealing with the large scale of the system. In this paper, we present a case study in building fog computing applications using our open source platform Distributed Node‐RED (DNR). In particular, we show how applications can be decomposed and deployed to a geographically distributed infrastructure using DNR, and how existing software components can be adapted and reused to participate in fog applications. We present a lab‐based implementation of a fog application built using DNR that addresses the first two of the issues highlighted earlier. To validate that our approach also deals with large scale, we augment our live trial with a large scale simulation of the application model, conducted in Omnet++, which shows the scalability of the model and how it supports the dynamic nature of fog applications.",Softw.

Thanks to the computing infrastructure that is closer to the network edge, communication cost and response time are significantly reduced. While promising, fog computing has its unique challenges, particularly due to its large number of computing elements, their geographic distribution and the dynamic nature of the edge network. First, the large scale complexity of fog computing poses new challenges in the application development process. By analysing various application models, we provide a new taxonomy with important trade-offs that help fog computing developers to navigate their design space in building fog applications. From here, we found that exogenous coordination, where there is a clear separation of concerns between computation and communication activities, is a suitable approach in supporting the complexity of many fog computing scenarios. Second, the geo-distribution of fog devices introduces new applications that depend on such devices’ physical context. While we found exogenous coordination to be a suitable approach, it is a software-focused concept that does not cater specifically to those hardware contexts. We propose to extend exogenous coordination with coordination primitives that help to express context-dependent fog application logic. Our proposal includes a clear separation of concerns between contextual and application data, context-dependent constraints for fog application components, and context-bounded communication cardinality among them.

The classification of HHs is critical to provide, among others, the required level of Quality of Service and reliability in both conventional and data center networks. HH classification is typically threshold‐based. However, there is no consistent and accepted threshold or set of thresholds that would reliably classify flows. Furthermore, existing threshold‐driven approaches use counters (e.g., duration, packets, and bytes); thus, their accuracy depends on how complete the flow information is. This paper paves the way to threshold‐agnostic HH identification by proposing an approach that performs HH classification based on per‐flow packet size distribution (PSD) and template matching (TM). PSD allows capturing the behavior and dynamism of network traffic flows (even from their first few packets). TM enables to classify HHs by measuring the similarity between the PSD of observed flows and a set of master templates representing the flow size behavior of HH classes. We evaluated the PSD‐ and TM‐based approach using flows extracted from real traffic traces. Results show that our approach classifies HHs accurately and timely, corroborating that the threshold‐less perspective is feasible for HH identification.",Int. J. Netw.

Live streaming experience is very susceptible to short-time-scale network congestion since client playback buffers are often no more than a few seconds. Unfortunately, identifying such streams and measuring their QoE for network management is challenging, since content providers largely use the same delivery infrastructure for live and videoon-demand (VoD) streaming, and packet inspection techniques (including SNI/DNS query monitoring) cannot always distinguish between the two. In this paper, we design, build, and deploy ReCLive: a machine learning method for live video detection and QoE measurement based on network-level behavioral characteristics.

We release our traffic traces as open data to the public; (2) We develop an LSTM-based binary classifier model that distinguishes live from on-demand streams in real-time with over 95% accuracy across providers; (3) We develop a method that estimates QoE metrics of live streaming flows in terms of resolution and buffer stall events with overall accuracies of 93% and 90%, respectively; and (4) Finally, we prototype our solution, train it in the lab, and deploy it in a live ISP network serving more than 7,000 subscribers. Measurements from the field show that 99.8% of Twitch videos are streamed live, while this measure is only 2.3% for YouTube. Further, during peak hours as many as 15% of live video streams are played at low-definition resolution and about 7% of them experience a buffer stall.

IoT devices use an extensive variety of firmware and provide little (or no) access for the management of their operating systems and configurations. Operators of the IoT infrastructure, therefore, need to employ traffic classification models (trained by historical data) to automatically detect their assets on the network and ensure the health of devices against cyber attacks by monitoring their network behavior. On the other hand, IoT manufacturers often automatically perform firmware upgrades from cloud servers to devices that are operational in the field. This can potentially lead to a change of device behavior which makes it difficult for network operators to maintain classification models (incorporating changes without retraining the entire model). In this article, we develop a modular device classification architecture that allows operators to automatically detect IoT devices by their network activity and dynamically accommodate legitimate changes in assets (either addition of new device profile or upgrade of existing profiles). Our contributions are threefold: 1) we identify key traffic attributes that can be obtained from flow-level network telemetry to characterize the behavior of various IoT device types. We develop an unsupervised one-class clustering method for each device to detect their normal network behavior; 2) we tune device-specific clustering models and use them to classify IoT devices from their network traffic in real time. We enhance our classification by developing methods for automatic conflict resolution and noise filtering; and 3) we evaluate the efficacy of our scheme by applying it to traffic traces (benign and attack) from ten real IoT devices and demonstrate its ability to detect behavioral changes with an overall accuracy of more than 94%.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

While IoT networks have the potential to benefit our lives, they create privacy and security challenges not seen with traditional IT networks. Due to the lack of visibility, operators of such smart environments are not often aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This thesis is the culmination of our efforts to develop techniques to profile the network behavioral pattern of IoTs, automate IoT classification, deduce their operating context, and detect anomalous behavior indicative of cyber-attacks. 
We begin this thesis by surveying IoT ecosystem, while reviewing current approaches to vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, and behavioral monitoring. For our first contribution, we collect traffic traces and characterize the network behavior of IoT devices via attributes from traffic patterns. We develop a robust machine learning-based inference engine trained with these attributes and demonstrate real-time classification of 28 IoT devices with over 99% accuracy. Our second contribution enhances the classification by reducing the cost of attribute extraction while also identifying IoT device states. Prototype implementation and evaluation demonstrate the ability of our supervised machine learning method to detect behavioral changes for five IoT devices. Our third and final contribution develops a modularized unsupervised inference engine that dynamically accommodates the addition of new IoT devices and/or updates to existing ones, without requiring system-wide retraining of the model.

The monitoring and fault detection are performed remotely without human intervention that predicts faults and ensures specific operational control. This article introduces a rational fault diagnosis process (RFDP) best suited for remote fault detection and diagnosis of CNC machine tools. The proposed process monitors different operational segments of the machine and extracts related data to validate its performance. The interconnection between the segments and fault impact are identified using the transfer learning process. The previously identified faults are used in the state training process to improve detection and diagnosis accuracy. Depending on the operational control continuity, the performance is assessed post the fault diagnosis. The learning paradigm is trained using the machine’s efficiency and rational data processing to predict the transfer states’ faults. The transfer states are modulated based on the efficiency and minimum-maximum control recommended for the CNC machine. This process’s performance is validated using detection accuracy, diagnosis recommendation, downtime, data processing rate, and processing time. From the experimental analysis, it is seen that for the varying data extraction rates, the proposed process improves detection accuracy by 10.14%, diagnosis recommendation by 8.58% and data processing rate by 7.95%, reducing the downtime by 8.85%, and processing by 11.24%.",Scientific Programming,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Although several transport protocols have been developed over the years to cater to the Quality-of-Service requirements of these network services, the dynamic nature of the network condition is a variable that creates a hindrance in the mapping of an efficient transport protocol to a network service. Dynamic Protocol Selection can serve as a potential solution for this by applying innovative techniques to adaptively select among pre-existing transport protocols during run-time, thus catering to these requirements dynamically. Although the concept has been proven to be beneficial, there are certain research gaps that are yet to be addressed. In this thesis, we attempt to take a step forward to address a few of these research gaps. As a result, we designed a standardized conceptual framework (DPS framework) for the Dynamic Selection of various TCP congestion control algorithms (as the pre-existing transport protocols). To enable this framework to function autonomously, we developed an online learning strategy implemented in the framework design. Also, to ensure efficient deployability of the framework in a real-network, we further proposed a fairness framework to manage multiple DPS framework-enabled application flows to co-exist sustainably. Through our experiments, we demonstrated the trade-off between application flow performance and learning time for the proposed online learning strategy and the ways it can be tuned to benefit certain types of application flows. We further presented results that showcased around 15% improvement in the fairness performance between multiple application flows and stability in the average flow performance due to the implementation of the proposed fairness framework.",,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Several large ecosystems of serverless platforms, both open- and closed-source, aim to realize this promise. Consequently, a lucrative market has emerged. However, the performance trade-offs of these systems are not well-understood. Moreover, it is exactly the high level of abstraction and the opaqueness of the operational-side that make performance evaluation studies of serverless platforms challenging. Learning from the history of IT platforms, we argue that a benchmark for serverless platforms could help address this challenge. We envision a comprehensive serverless benchmark, which we contrast to the narrow focus of prior work in this area. We argue that a comprehensive benchmark will need to take into account more than just runtime overhead, and include notions of cost, realistic workloads, more (open-source) platforms, and cloud integrations. Finally, we show through preliminary real-world experiments how such a benchmark can help compare the performance overhead when running a serverless workload on state-of-the-art platforms.",ICPE Companion,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Any type of computing applications, such as data calculation or analysis, can be described as workflows. Cloud computing provides an effective platform for executing large and complex workflow applications conveniently and cheaply through its delivering internet-based services as a pay-as-you-go model. However, the performance of workflow scheduler directly affects the Quality of Service (QoS) of the cloud users, and how to efficiently allocate the heterogeneous cloud resources to execute workflows still faces big challenges. In this work, an improved Deep Q Network (DQN)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for workflow scheduling is developed to optimize dual objectives like makespan and cost simultaneously. First, we test the performance of DQN and Actor-critic (AC) based RL algorithm in scheduling workflows respectively, then modify the reward function for the DQN algorithm to improve its convergence and universality for optimization problems. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify our approach and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can minimize both makespan and cost, as well as adjust user preference for the specific optimization objective and accordingly increase the diversity of generated scheduling schemes.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The first challenge is the realistic estimation of the resource demand of a workflow, as it is important for making good task placement and resource allocation decisions. Usually, workflows consist of segments with different parallelism and different interconnection types between tasks which affect the order how the tasks become eligible. Moreover, realistic task runtime estimates are not always available. The second challenge is the efficient placement of workflow tasks on computing resources for minimizing average workflow slowdown while achieving fairness. A wrongly chosen task placement policy can easily degrade the performance and negatively affect the fair access of workflows to computing resources. The third challenge is the automatic allocation (autoscaling) of computing resources for workflows while meeting deadline and budget constraints. Computing clouds make it possible to easily lease and release resources. Such decisions should be made wisely to minimize slowdowns and deadline violations, and to efficiently use the leased resources to reduce incurred costs. To address these challenges, this dissertation proposes novel scheduling policies for workloads of workflows and investigates the applicability of relevant state-of-the-art policies to the online scenario. For new policies, implementation effort and suitability for production systems are kept in mind. The considered workflow scheduling policies are experimentally evaluated by conducting a wide set of simulation-based and real-world experiments on a private multicluster computer. Additionally, a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach is used to validate the obtained real-world experimental results versus the optimal solution from a MIP solver.",,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

These servers can be unilaterally revoked by the provider, usually after a warning period to the user. Until recently, it has been thought that these servers are not suitable to run latency-sensitive workloads due to their transient availability. In this paper, we introduce SpotWeb, a framework for running latency-sensitive web workloads on transient computing platforms while maintaining the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the running applications. SpotWeb is based on three novel concepts; using multi-period optimization---a novel approach developed in finance---for server selection; transiency-aware load-balancing; and using intelligent capacity over-provisioning. We implement SpotWeb and evaluate its performance in both simulations and testbed experiments. Our results show that SpotWeb reduces costs by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art solutions while being scalable to hundreds of cloud server configurations.",HPDC,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Within cloud computing, serverless computing has emerged as a model that further abstracts away operational complexity of heterogeneous cloud resources. Central to this form of computing is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS); a cloud model that enables users to express applications as functions, further decoupling the application logic from the hardware and other operational concerns. Although FaaS has seen rapid adoption for simple use cases, there are several issues that impede its use for more complex use cases. A key issue is the lack of systems that facilitate the reuse of existing functions to create more complex, composed functions. Current approaches for serverless function composition are either proprietary, resource inefficient, unreliable, or do not scale. To address this issue, we propose an approach to orchestrate composed functions using reliably and efficiently with workflows. As a prototype, we design and implement Fission Workflows: an open-source serverless workflow system which leverages the characteristics of serverless functions to improve the (re)usability, performance, and reliability of function compositions. We evaluate our prototype using both synthetic and real-world experiments, which show that the system is comparable with or better than state-of-the-art workflow systems, while costing significantly less. Based on the experimental evaluation and the industry interest in the Fission Workflows product, we believe that serverless workflow orchestration will enable the use of serverless applications for more complex use cases.",,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

For example, running workloads of workflows on behalf of customers is desirable, but requires increasingly more sophisticated autoscaling policies, that is, policies that dynamically provision resources for the customer. Although selecting and tuning autoscaling policies is a challenging task for datacenter operators, so far relatively few studies investigate the performance of autoscaling for workloads of workflows. Complementing previous knowledge, in this work we propose the first comprehensive performance study in the field. Using trace-based simulation, we compare state-of-the-art autoscaling policies across multiple application domains, workload arrival patterns (e.g., burstiness), and system utilization levels. We further investigate the interplay between autoscaling and regular allocation policies, and the complexity cost of autoscaling. Our quantitative study focuses not only on traditional performance metrics and on state-of-the-art elasticity metrics, but also on time-and memory-related autoscaling-complexity metrics. Our main results give strong and quantitative evidence about previously unreported operational behavior, for example, that autoscaling policies perform differently across application domains and allocation and provisioning policies should be co-designed.","2018 18th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)",2017,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Design aspects of the robot, such as mechanical design, control architecture and autonomy functions, are comprehensively described in the paper, and insights are included. Maintaining the robot’s position in the middle of a drain when moving along the drain is essential for the inspection process. Thus, a fuzzy logic controller has been introduced to the robot to cater to this demand. Experiments have been conducted by deploying a prototype of the design to drain environments considering a set of diverse test scenarios. Experiment results show that the proposed controller effectively maintains the robot in the middle of a drain while moving along the drain.

However, with the increase of management facilities, the aging of facilities for long-term use is becoming more and more apparent. The standard expected durability of these pipes is approximately 50 years, but there is a tendency and a risk that the number of collapsed roads will increase rapidly 30 years after the pipes are laid. Against this background, maintenance of drainage and sewage pipes is critical and must be carried out continuously. Therefore, in recent years, investigation using robots have been actively conducted in order to reduce manual workload of the workers. However, these robots have a large-scale system as a whole, and as a result, they are poorly maintainable and expensive. Therefore, in this research, I have developed an autonomous and portable pipe inspection robot through the know-how on rescue robots which I have studied so far. However, for inspections using a pipe inspection robot, there is always the risk that the robot itself will tip over due to steps or small gaps at the joints of the pipes or slips caused by sludge. Therefore, to prevent tumbles and rollovers of the robot, I propose a localization method only by straight-driving control without relying on hardware. In addition, taking possible slips inside pipes into account, this method utilizes only acceleration sensor. In this study, localization method using only accelerometer mounted on the robot, which focuses on the relation between the pipe and the contact point of the tires, was shown as well as presenting a method using numerical analysis to derive the estimated values. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the estimation was stable as a result of an estimation experiment using autonomous small pipe inspection robot with and without a gradient (approx. 4/100) of a pipe, with a diameter of 189mm.",,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The design targets of the arm, its operations, measurement ability, and mobility, were set for the task of inspecting an industrial plant. To accomplish the targets, we designed the folding arm considering both accessibility to high locations and the mobility of the articulated mobile robot to which it is attached. The arm has links, joints, dummy wheels, and sensors and enables the robot to which it is attached to manipulate objects, e.g. rotating valves, opening a door, or inspecting by accessing high locations. In addition, changing the posture of the arm and touching the dummy wheel in the arm to the surrounding terrain can reduce any negative effect of the arm on the robot's mobility when it encounters narrow spaces, stairs, steps, and trenches. The arm is controlled as a six degrees-of-freedom manipulator without redundancy by an operator who directly sets two joint angles. The effectiveness of the developed arm was demonstrated not only through experiments in a laboratory but also in a field test at the Plant Disaster Prevention Challenge of the World Robot Summit 2018.

The average service life of sewer pipe has been determined to be 50 years, but in reality, 30 years after pipes are built there is a tendency for rapid road subsidence and cave in. This situation stressed to us the importance of regular sewer pipe maintenance and inspection. In line with this, recently, robots have been actively used for inspection to reduce workload. However, the full system for the robots becomes large scale, resulting in high expense and poor maintenance.

However, the transported oil and the environment in which the pipeline is located may corrode the metal to the point of failure, affecting not only production but also the environment. In addition, activities such as inspection and maintenance are more complex due to difficult access – exposure to toxins, a wide variety of terrains and the special cloths are just some of the challenges. Therefore, pipelines require processes recurrent and autonomous, which motivates the development of new technologies: the machinery of inspection should be cheap, robust and versatile for maintenance, cleaning, removal of fluids, product separation and inspection. The reconfigurable modular robots are autonomous machines with variable morphology and, with the reorganization of the connectivity of parts (called modules), this architecture offers a greater degree of flexibility and fault tolerance at a lower cost. Because of its low cost, robustness and versatility reconfigurable modular robots can perform inspection tasks and reduce production costs in the Oil and Oil Industry. The objective of this work is to design, build and test a module of a reconfigurable modular robot with sensors for inspection in pipelines, called ErekoBot. Each module must have the ability to estimate its own pose, detect an obstacle and align yourself with a plan (simulating a pipe). In this work, the most suitable sensors for ErekoBot were chosen: four infrared sensors and an inertial measurement unit. After the definition of the sensors, the complete module was designed and its prototype was built, considering shape, size, weight, electronic circuit, position of components and material. Tests with the prototype has shown that the module is capable of (1) to estimate its own orientation, (2) detecting the presence of obstacles and (3) align with a plane. These abilities are sufficient to allow a situation where the robot must move moved through a pipeline, avoid obstacles and stop at a specific position to perform an inspection inside the tube.",,2015,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This network needs to be monitored constantly and segments need to be replaced when the risks of leaks increase. Since no information can be obtained from inse the network, in this thesis the design of a robot which can move (autonomously) through the gas distribution network for inspection is investigated. 
 
Three prototypes have been realised. The design of a propulsion mechanism depends strongly on the layout of the gas distribution network. The most important aspects are long stretches of pipe (tens of metres), a diameter range of 63 mm to 125 mm, (mitre) bends, T-joints and inclinations up to 30◦. 
 
The design consists of a wheeled robot ‘snake’ consisting of a number of modules which can be used as two clamping V-shapes. The central module is a rotation joint which can be used to change the orientation of the robot in a pipe. 
 
To reduce the amount of wiring, the electronic system has been distributed over the robot segments. A master controller is added which communicates to these distributed ’slave nodes’ via a serial bus. Also energy for propulsion is provided through this bus. 
 
A camera system has been developed which can be used for both pipe assessment and navigation. The camera system uses a laser projector which projects a cone (circle) on the inside of the pipe. Deformations of the pipe and obstacles such as bends and T-joints show up as deviations of the captured circle shape. 
 
The first prototype has been designed and produced in a ‘conventional’ way which took a long time and missed some crucial steps in integration. The second and third prototype have been designed and produced using `digital fabrication' tools (3D printing, laser cutting). The differences in design and production between the first prototype and the subsequent prototypes can be used to describe the importance of accessibility, visibility and availability of these fabrication tools as condition for fruitful usage.",,2014,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This thesis deals with the locomotion control of limbless robots, concentrating specifically on the study of a hierarchical control architecture as steps toward developing limbless robots capable of 3D locomotion, fast reflex responses and sophisticated responses to environmental stimuli. 
 
First, an overview of limbless robots is presented. Various limbless robots found in the literature are investigated. The survey not only introduces some potential applications for limbless robots, but also establishes a classification of limbless locomotion according to the limbless robots\\\' configurations and auxiliary equipment. Moreover, different approaches to autonomously generate motion patterns for limbless robots are discussed. One type of control approaches based on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) is emphasized, since it is ideally suited to being applied to a hierarchical control architecture. 
 
Then, a bio-inspired CPG model is proposed. The key problem for developing such a hierarchical control architecture is how to design a CPG based controller that can not only generate various gaits, but also provide a solution for realizing reflex mechanisms as well as integrating sensory feedback. To this end, a CPG model inspired by the neuronal circuit diagram in the spinal cord of swimming lampreys is designed. A set of interneurons described with sigmoid functions and leaky integrators is incorporated into the design of the neural oscillator for rhythmic signal generation. Furthermore, according to the connection between neural oscillators, a chained type and a cyclic type of CPG circuits are developed. The chained type CPG circuit is used for generating traveling waves between oscillators, while the cyclic type CPG circuit is used for producing synchronization and maintenance activities. Through numerical simulations, the control parameters over relevant characteristics of the two types of CPG circuits are studied in detail. 
 
Next, the proposed CPG model is further designed for limbless gait implementation. Considering the configuration of limbless robots with pitch modules and yaw modules connected alternatively, two CPG circuits are applied to the pitch grouped modules and the yaw grouped modules, respectively. Both the necessary conditions for cooperation between the two CPG circuits and the control parameters for fast limbless locomotion are investigated. Four types of limbless gaits, i.e. side winding, rolling, turning and flapping are realized. Results of simulations and experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed CPG circuits in generating limbless locomotion. 
 
After that, in order to realize fast sensory reflex responses, the concept of both sensory neurons and reflex arcs are utilized. Since the proposed CPG model is derived from neural circuit in the spinal cord of lampreys and the existence of sensory neurons in lampreys has been proven, it is simple and natural to add sensory neurons into the proposed CPG model at the neuronal level. Based on the design of the sensory neurons, a reflex mechanism taking advantage of reflex arcs forms short pathways to bridge external stimuli and the CPG model. Thus fast responses can be made when the external stimuli are afferent to the CPG model. A ball hitting experiment and a corridor passing experiment confirm the feasibility of the reflex mechanism. 
 
Finally, the development of sophisticated responses to environmental stimuli is presented. A framework that combines the CPG model with a learning method is proposed for achieving adaptive limbless locomotion. The key issue of the framework is to find a mapping that converts external stimuli to proper sensory input, so as to modify the output of the CPG model and thus enable the limbless robot to adapt to environments. Two types of learning methods, i.e. a genetic algorithm (GA) based method and a reinforcement learning (RL) based method are applied to the framework, respectively. Through a slope climbing experiment, it is verified that both of them can achieve adaptive limbless locomotion. Furthermore, the performance of adaptive limbless locomotion under the two methods is compared and analyzed, which provides future work with the possible solutions for promoting the performance of adaptive limbless locomotion. 
 
From the results of simulations and experiments, the hierarchical control architecture is confirmed to be a solid platform for improving the locomotive behaviors of limbless robots.",,2013,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This paper proposes a snake-like active wheel robot named “ACM-R4.1” with torque sensor and torque limiter on each of the joints. Introduced torque sensor is composed of 2 thin ring plates holding steel balls in the oval cavities in between and a rubber ring producing compressing force of the thin ring plates in the narrow gap of a joint. Applied torque of the joint produces small sliding motion of the ball inside oval cavities and thus measurement of the small displacement of these plates enable to detect the applied torque. Overload-protection to the joint actuator is made by the sliding motion of the rubber which acts after the ball motion in the cavities and they hit the end of cavities. We made theoretical consideration of design of the torque sensor and did torque measurement experiments by using constructed snake-like active wheel robot ACM-R4.1.

It is focused specifically on the study of 1D topology configurations (called snakes or limbless robots). The problem to solve is how to coordinate the joint's movement so that modular robots can move both in one and two dimensions. A big challenge in robotics is the development of a very versatile robot with the full capability of moving on different terrains. This is especially important in applications where the environment is unknown in advance, such as the exploration of other planet's surfaces, navigation in hostile environments and search and rescue operations. Modular robotics offers the promise of increasing the versatility in locomotion by means of building robots from basic modules. Each configuration has its own locomotive characteristics that should be studied. If the robots have the ability to be self-reconfigurable, then they will be able to change their shapes and topology in order to select the best gait for every terrain and negotiate with different tasks. One kind of bio-inspired controllers for mobile robots used in the last decade are based on CPG (Central pattern generators), which are a specialized neurons that produce rhythms for controlling the muscle activities of animals. In the steady state CPG behave like fixed-frequency oscillators. For that reason, they can be replaced by a simplified model like sinusoidal generators. The main advantage is that they are extremely simple to implement and requires very few computing resources. Therefore, they can be implemented in low-end inexpensive microcontrollers. Moreover, the generators can also be realized directly as hardware components using either digital or analog electronics. In this dissertation a general classification of modular robots is established based on their topologies and types of connection. The hypothesis of using sinusoidal generators for controlling the locomotion of 1D pitch-pitch and pitch-yaw modular robots of any length is raised. The results show that this simple model is efficient and the gaits obtained are natural and smooth. It is shown that at least they can move in five different movements. Some of them are totally new and have not been previously studied or implemented by other researchers, from the best of our knowledge. In addition, the relationships between the generator's parameters and the robot kinematics have been obtained. Another problem is to find the minimal configurations for locomotion, which are the modular robots within the studied groups that have the minimum number of modules and are still capable of moving in one and two dimensions. This problem has been solved and the two minimal configurations are presented. Their kinematics models are studied throughout too. The experiments confirm that the solutions found to the coordination problem are valid for the locomotion of real mobile modular robots. Four kinds of modular robotic prototypes have been built using the identical Y1 modules, which have been designed specifically for this thesis. Finally the knowledge about the locomotion of pitch-pitch and pitch-yaw connecting modular robots has been summarized in 27 key principles.",,2008,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The virtual tube algorithm is introduced which enables a multi-segmented robot to range in such complex environment. Precise force feedback is required. Therefore, we present a sensor system which is based on strain-gauges technology. Information extracted by this sensor enables the trajectory planning algorithm to adapt its curve.

Serpentine robots are mobile robots with one unique characteristic: they have a very large ratio of length to diameter. To implement this unique shape, they usually have multiple segments connected by joints. Some serpentine robots provide legged, wheeled, or tracked propulsion, and, in addition, actuation for the joints. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of pneumatic integrated joint actuators (IJA) invented and built especially for serpentine robots. The IJA combines advantages of pneumatic bellows-like actuators with our proportional position and stiffness (PPS) control algorithm. Controllable stiffness is of crucial importance in serpentine robots, which require stiff joints to cross gaps and compliant joints to conform to rough terrain for effective propulsion.

Researchers in areas such as machine and deep learning use extensively edge and cloud computing for their applications, mainly due to the significant computational and storage resources that they provide. Currently, Robotics is seeking to take advantage of these capabilities as well, and with the development of 5G networks, some existing limitations in the field can be overcome. In this context, it is important to know how to utilize the emerging edge architectures, what types of edge architectures and platforms exist today and which of them can and should be used based on each robotic application. In general, Edge platforms can be implemented and used differently, especially since there are several providers offering more or less the same set of services with some essential differences.

In this context monocular cameras are a valuable solution because of their low system requirements. However, the associated image processing algorithms are either too computationally expen-sive for real time on-board implementation, or not enough accurate. In this paper we propose a pose estimation software exploiting neural network architectures which can be scaled to different accuracy-latency trade-offs. We designed our pipeline to be compatible with Edge Tensor Processing Units to show how low power machine learning accelerators could enable Artificial Intelligence exploitation in space. The neural networks were tested both on the benchmark Spacecraft Pose Estimation Dataset, and on the pur-posely developed Cosmo Photorealistic Dataset, which depicts a COSMO-SkyMed satellite in a variety of random poses and steerable solar panels orientations.

New generative techniques, such as unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT), have recently been applied to the task of generating source code, translating it from one programming language to another. The artifacts produced in this way may contain imperfections, such as compilation or logical errors. We examine the extent to which software engineers would tolerate such imperfections and explore ways to aid the detection and correction of those errors. Using a design scenario approach, we interviewed 11 software engineers to understand their reactions to the use of an NMT model in the context of application modernization, focusing on the task of translating source code from one language to another. Our three-stage scenario sparked discussions about the utility and desirability of working with an imperfect AI system, how acceptance of that system’s outputs would be established, and future opportunities for generative AI in application modernization.

High power consumption increases cooling cost, degrades the system reliability and also reduces the battery life in portable devices. Modern computing/communication devices support multiple power modes which enable power and performance tradeoff. Dynamic power management (DPM), dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and dynamic task migration for workload consolidation are system level power reduction techniques widely used during runtime. In the first part of the dissertation, we concentrate on the dynamic power management of the personal computer and server platform where the DPM, DVFS and task migrations techniques are proved to be highly effective. A hierarchical energy management framework is assumed, where task migration is applied at the upper level to improve server utilization and energy efficiency, and DPM/DVFS is applied at the lower level to manage the power mode of individual processor. This work focuses on estimating the performance impact of workload consolidation and searching for optimal DPM/DVFS that adapts to the changing workload. Machine learning based modeling and reinforcement learning based policy optimization techniques are investigated. Mobile computing has been weaved into everyday lives to a great extend in recent years. Compared to traditional personal computer and server environment, the mobile computing environment is obviously more context-rich and the usage of mobile computing device is clearly imprinted with user’s personal signature. The ability to learn such signature enables immense potential in workload prediction and energy or battery life management. In the second part of the dissertation, we present two mobile device power management techniques which take advantage of the context-rich characteristics of mobile platform and make adaptive energy management decisions based on different user behavior. We firstly investigate the user battery usage behavior modeling and apply the model directly for battery energy management. The first technique aims at maximizing the quality of service (QoS) while keeping the risk of battery depletion below a given threshold. The second technique is an user-aware streaming strategies for energy efficient smartphone video playback applications (e.g. YouTube) that minimizes the sleep and wake penalty of cellular module and at the same time avoid the energy waste from excessive downloading. Runtime power and thermal management has attracted substantial interests in multi-core distributed embedded systems. Fast performance evaluation is an essential step in the research of distributed power and thermal management. In last part of the dissertation, we present an FPGA based emulator of multi-core distributed embedded system designed to support the research in runtime power/thermal management.

In particular, the use of the digital twin in a manufacturing environment makes it possible to test such approaches in a timely manner using a realistic 3D environment that limits incurring safety issues and danger of damage to resources. To obtain superior performance in an Industry 4.0 setup, a modified version of a binary gravitational search algorithm is introduced which benefits from an exclusive or (XOR) operator and a repository to improve the exploration property of the algorithm. Mathematical analysis of the proposed optimization approach is performed which resulted in two theorems which show that the proposed modification to the velocity vector can direct particles to the best particles. The use of repository in this algorithm provides a guideline to direct the particles to the best solutions more rapidly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on some benchmark optimization problems covering a diverse range of functions including unimodal and multimodal as well as those which suffer from multiple local minima. The proposed algorithm is compared against several existing binary optimization algorithms including existing versions of a binary gravitational search algorithm, improved binary optimization, binary particle swarm optimization, binary grey wolf optimization and binary dragonfly optimization. To show that the proposed approach is an effective method to deal with real world binary optimization problems raised in an Industry 4.0 environment, it is then applied to optimize the assembly task of an industrial robot assembling an industrial calculator. The optimal movements obtained are then implemented on a real robot. Furthermore, the digital twin of a universal robot is developed, and its path planning is done in the presence of obstacles using the proposed optimization algorithm. The obtained path is then inspected by human expert and validated.

However, making the Digital Twin behavior matching with the real system is challenging due to the number of unknown parameters. Its search can be done using optimization-based techniques, producing a family of models based on different system datasets. So, a discrimination criterion is required to determine the best Digital Twin model. This paper presents an information theory-based discrimination criterion to determine the best Digital Twin model resulting from a behavioral matching process. The Information Gain of a model is employed as a discrimination criterion. Box-Jenkins models are used to define the family of models for each behavioral matching result. The proposed method is compared with other information-based metrics and the $\nu$gap metric. As a study case, the discrimination method is applied to the Digital Twin for a real-time vision feedback infrared temperature uniformity control system.

This article addresses the challenges of decision making at highly uncertain intersections of different shapes by proposing a generalized critical turning point (CTP)-based hierarchical decision-making and planning method. The high-level planner takes the road map information and generates CTPs using a parameterized extraction model that is proposed and verified by naturalistic driving data. The CTPs are used to generate behavior-oriented paths that could be adapted to various intersections. These modifications help to assure high searching efficiency of the planning process. The low-level planner makes real-time, 2-D planning using a partially observable Markov decision process solver, which can handle the uncertainties of the intersections and make less conservative yet safe actions. With proper modifications, our proposed method can make commute-efficient 2-D planning decisions at unsignalized intersections of various shapes in real time.",IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Despite their significant progress, numerous convolutional neural networks (CNN) are limited in practical applications, owing to the requirement of the heavy computational cost of the model. This paper proposes a multi-path network for SISR, known as multi-path deep CNN with residual inception network for single image super-resolution. In detail, a residual/ResNet block with an Inception block supports the main framework of the entire network architecture. In addition, remove the batch normalization layer from the residual network (ResNet) block and max-pooling layer from the Inception block to further reduce the number of parameters to preventing the over-fitting problem during the training. Moreover, a conventional rectified linear unit (ReLU) is replaced with Leaky ReLU activation function to speed up the training process. Specifically, we propose a novel two upscale module, which adopts three paths to upscale the features by jointly using deconvolution and upsampling layers, instead of using single deconvolution layer or upsampling layer alone. The extensive experimental results on image super-resolution (SR) using five publicly available test datasets, which show that the proposed model not only attains the higher score of peak signal-to-noise ratio/structural similarity index matrix (PSNR/SSIM) but also enables faster and more efficient calculations against the existing image SR methods. For instance, we improved our method in terms of overall PSNR on the SET5 dataset with challenging upscale factor 8× as 1.88 dB over the baseline bicubic method and reduced computational cost in terms of number of parameters 62% by deeply-recursive convolutional neural network (DRCN) method.",Electronics,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

A system is called efficient, if it is simultaneously reliable and robust. In this paper, we consider robot navigation under uncertain environments in which robot sensors may generate disturbed measures affecting the robot decisions. We aim to propose an efficient decision-making model, based on Deep Neural Network (DNN), for robot navigation. Hence, we propose an adversarial training step based on data augmentation to improve robot decisions under uncertain environment. Our contribution is based on investigating data augmentation which is based on uncertainty noise to improve the robustness and performance of the decision model. We also focus on two metrics, Efficiency and Pareto Front, combining robustness and performance to select the best data augmentation rate.

AGVs can be programmed to be smart with the current technological advancements. In doing so, we can apply them to assist humans in many aspects like reducing road accidents, enabling us to use cars without driving knowledge, autonomous patrolling in dangerous zones, and autonomous farming. For AGVs to operate at this level of automation, it must be equipped with sensory perception devices to be aware of its surroundings, and also, a way to perceives this data is crucial. As a first step towards this, researchers have developed a vast number of camera vision-based efficient neural network algorithms for detecting and avoiding obstacles. Unfortunately, an AGV cannot survive only with computer vision as it suffers from several effects like night driving and erroneous estimation of distance information. Camera vision and lidar vision together is suitable for AGVs to operate in all conditions like day, night, and fog. We propose a novel neural network model, which transforms the lidar sensor data into obstacle avoidance decisions, which is integrated into the hybrid vision of any AGV. Existing lidar sensor-based obstacle detection and avoidance systems like 2D collision cone approaches are not suitable for real-time applications, as they lag in providing accurate and quick responses, which leads to collisions. The proposed intelligent Field of View (FOV) mechanism replaces classical mathematical approaches, which accurately mimics the behavior of human drivers. The model quickly takes decisions with a high level of accuracy to command the AGV upon being obstructed with obstacles in the trajectory. This makes the AGV drive in obstacle rich environments without manual maneuvering autonomously.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

To address the problem, we propose an improved single-shot multibox detector (SSD) using enhanced feature map blocks (SSD-EMB). The enhanced feature map block (EMB) consists of attention stream and feature map concatenation stream. The attention stream allows the proposed model to focus on the object regions rather than background owing to channel averaging and the effectiveness of the normalization. The feature map concatenation stream provides additional semantic information to the model without degrading the detection speed. By combining the output of these two streams, the enhanced feature map, which improves the detection of a small object, is generated. Experimental results show that the proposed model has high accuracy in small object detection. The proposed model not only achieves good detection accuracy, but also has a good detection speed.

In order to promote wind power accommodation and reduce system carbon emissions, a cooperative operation model of wind turbine and carbon capture power plant (CCPP) is constructed. Then, the model is equivalently transformed into two sub-problems. One is the operation optimization sub-problem of cooperative alliance with the goal of maximizing the alliance benefit. The other is the benefit distribution sub-problem with the goal of fair distributing cooperative benefit. To protect participants’ privacy, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to realize the distributed solution of the two sub-problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by an example, and the sensitivity analysis of the alliance benefit and system carbon emission is carried out with carbon price and carbon capture cost as the sensitivity factors. The example results show that: (1) By providing up and down regulation services to wind turbines, CCPP can obtain ancillary service income and help to reduce the declaration deviation of wind turbines, which can realize multi-win-win situation. (2) Carbon price affects both thermal power units and carbon capture equipment. So, compared with carbon costs, the carbon emissions and the alliance benefit are both more sensitive to carbon price. The model of the paper is constructed under the deviation punishment mechanism, and subsequent research can be expanded in combination with a more detailed imbalance settlement mechanism.",Sustainability,2022.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The mathematical model of the phenomenon is governed by a coupled nonlinear differential equation that corresponds to the reaction kinetics and diffusion. The system of differential equations is subjected to Dirichlet boundary conditions and a mixed set of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Further, to calculate the concentration of CO2, PGE, and the flux in terms of reaction rate constants, we adopt the supervised learning strategy of a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) neural network model with two activation functions (Log-sigmoid and Hyperbolic tangent). The reference data set for the possible outcomes of different scenarios based on variations in normalized parameters (α1, α2, β1, β2, k) are obtained using the MATLAB solver “pdex4”. The dataset is further interpreted by the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm for validation, testing, and training. The results obtained by the NARX-LM algorithm are compared with the Adomian decomposition method and residual method.

Autonomous diagnostics is an area of opportunity to deploy this capability, which allows for vehicle failure awareness and enables for other advantageous schemes such as fault tolerant control. In this paper, we present one subsystem of an ensemble of schemes that form the Enhanced Autonomous Health Monitoring System (EAHMS) designed to support NASA's Robotics, Tele-Robotics and Autonomous Systems Roadmap. The EAHMS is aimed to provide an integral framework to determine the operational condition of on-board sensors (odometry), actuators, and power systems. Within the EAHMS context, this paper outlines a method for diagnostics of a robotic vehicle mechanical mobility subsystem by motor current and vibration signature analysis based upon Self Organizing Maps (SOM) using an enhanced neighborhood step decay algorithm. The learning algorithm was tested for different learning rate functions and was applied to different training set cases. The resulting algorithm was used for conducting failure diagnostics in a testbed, where three types of transmission/motor mechanical failures were considered: (a) damaged chain link; (b) motor gearbox damage; and (c) damaged sprocket. A core goal of this diagnostic approach is to enhance a novel methodology called the embedded Collaborative Learning Engine (eCLE), which combines supervised and unsupervised learning synergistically to process new emerging data signatures.

Therefore, it is paramount for the sustainable development of antiviral urban ecosystems to promote early detection, control, and prevention of an outbreak. The structure of an antivirus-based multi-generational smart-city framework could be crucial to a post-COVID-19 urban environment. Humanitarian efforts in the pandemic's framework deployed novel technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We aim to contribute by improving real-time detection using data mining in collaboration with machine learning techniques through our research work. Initially, for detection, we propose an innovative system that could detect in real-time virus propagation based on the density of the airborne COVID-19 molecules-the proposal based on the detection through the isothermal amplification RT-Lamp [1]. We also propose real-time detection by spark-induced plasma spectroscopy during the internal airborne transmission process [17]. The novelty of this research work, called characteristic subset selection, is based on identifying irrelevant data. By deducting the unrelated information dimension, machine learning algorithms would operate more efficiently. Therefore, it optimises data mining and classification in high-dimensional medical data analysis, particularly in effectively detecting COVID-19.

Cloud-centric approaches need to address several performance issues at all levels of the network, as massive metering datasets are transferred to distant machine clouds while respecting issues like security and data privacy. Our solution uses the fog computing paradigm to provide a system where the computational resources already available throughout the network infrastructure are utilized to facilitate greatly the analysis of fine-grained water consumption data collected by the smart meters, thus significantly reducing the overall load to network and cloud resources. Details of the system’s design are presented along with a pilot deployment in a real-world environment.

Electrocardiography monitoring devices (ECG) are the only tool that help physicians diagnose cardiac abnormalities. Although the design of ECGs has followed closely the electronics miniaturization evolution over the years, existing wearable ECGs have limited accuracy and rely on external resources to analyse the signals and evaluate heart activity. In this paper, we work towards empowering the wearable device with processing capabilities to locally analyse the signal and identify abnormal behaviour. The ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal heart activity significantly reduces (a) the need to store the signals, (b) the data transmitted to the cloud, (c) the overall power consumption and (d) the confidentiality of private data. Based on this concept, the HEART system presented in this work, combines wearable embedded devices, mobile edge devices, and cloud services to provide on-the-spot, reliable, accurate, and instant heart monitoring. The wearable device is remotely trained by a physician to learn to accurately identify critical events related to each particular patient. Following this training session, the wearable device becomes capable of interpreting a large number of heart abnormalities without relying on cloud services and edge resources, when the medical doctor is not present. The Fog computing approach extends the cloud computing paradigm by migrating data-processing closer to production site, thus accelerating the system's responsiveness to events. The HEART system's performance concerning the accuracy of detecting abnormal events and the power consumption of the wearable device is evaluated. Results indicate that a very high success rate can be achieved in terms of event detection ratio and the battery is able to sustain operation up to a full week without the need for recharge.",2018 14th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE),2018,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Most research robots are unfortunately too stiff to safely absorb impacts, too expensive to repair if broken repeatedly, and are never operated without the red kill-switch prominently displayed. The GummiArm Project was intended to be an open-source “soft” robot arm with human-inspired tendon actuation, sufficient dexterity for simple manipulation tasks, and with an eye on enabling easy replication of robotics experiments. The arm offers variable-stiffness and damped actuation, which lowers the potential for damage, and which enables new research opportunities in Embodied AI. The arm structure is printable on hobby-grade 3D printers for ease of manufacture, exploits stretchable composite tendons for robustness to impacts, and has a repair-cycle of minutes when something does break. The material cost of the arm is less than $6000, while the full set of structural parts, the ones most likely to break, can be printed with less than $20 worth of plastic filament. All this promotes a concurrent approach to the design of “brain” and “body,” and can help increase productivity and reproducibility in Embodied AI research. In this work we describe the motivation for, and the development and application of, this 6 year project.",Frontiers in Neurorobotics,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots’ perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software.

We explore the way that the ﬂexibility inherent in the lexicon might be incorporated into the process by which an environmentally grounded artiﬁcial agent – a robot – acquires language. We take ﬂexibility to indicate not only many-to-many mappings between words and extensions, but also the way that word meaning is speciﬁed in the context of a particular situation in the world. Our hypothesis is that embodiment and embededness are necessary conditions for the development of semantic representations that exhibit this ﬂexibility. We examine this hypothesis by ﬁrst very brieﬂy review-ing work to date in the domain of grounded language learning, and then proposing two research objectives: 1) the incorporation of high-dimensional semantic representations that permit context-speciﬁc projections, and 2) an exploration of ways in which non-humanoid robots might exhibit language-learning capacities.

However, privacy concerns prevent the adoption of MLaaS for applications with sensitive data. A promising privacy preserving solution is to use fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to perform the ML computations. Recent advancements have lowered computational costs by several orders of magnitude, opening doors for secure practical applications to be developed. This work looks to optimize FHE-based private machine learning inference by leveraging ternary neural networks. Such neural networks, whose weights are constrained to { -1,0,1 } , have special properties that we exploit in this work to operate efﬁciently in the homomorphic domain. We introduce a general framework that takes a user-deﬁned model as input (bring-your-own-network), performs plaintext training, and efﬁciently evaluates private inference leveraging FHE.

It is necessary to balance the computational load on each processor during parallel computing. This often requires the prediction of the computational intensity (CI). The existing CI prediction researches are often based on prior knowledge and empirical formulas which requires manual setting and calibration of parameters. This paper discusses the way of model construction and parallelism for a raster algorithm, peak point extraction(PPE), based on the machine learning-based construction of a CI prediction model. The computational intensity of the spatial domain is predicted by a machine learning method, and the spatial domain is divided in balance to improve the parallel performance of the raster algorithm. Three datasets are used to test the parallel effect. Under 24 processes, the speedup ratio achieved by our method ranges from 20.6 to 16.8, and the parallel efficiency is 0.8 to 0.7.

A Review and Application to Flexiramp Requirements,"— Net load uncertainty in electricity spot markets is rapidly growing. There are five general approaches by which system operators and market participants can use probabilistic forecasts of wind, solar, and load to help manage this uncertainty. These include operator situation awareness, resource risk hedging, reserves procurement, definition of contingencies, and explicit stochastic optimization. We review these approaches, and then provide a case study in which a method for using probabilistic solar forecasts to define needs for reserves is developed and evaluated. The case study has three parts. First, we describe building blocks for enhancing the Watt-Sun solar forecasting system to produce probabilistic irradiance and power forecasts. Second, relationships between Watt-Sun forecasts for multiple sites in California and the system’s need for flexible ramp capability (flexiramp) are defined by machine learning and statistical methods. Third, the performance of present methods to defining flexiramp requirements, which are not conditioned on weather and renewables forecasts, is compared with that of probabilistic solar forecast-based requirements, using a multi-timescale production costing model with an 1820-bus representation of the WECC power system.

Organizations have challenges in becoming data-driven at scale, with centralized teams and modules acting as bottlenecks, responsible for many aspects such as data governance, ingestion, or engineering. Placing the tools in the hands of developers and empowering engineers across all business domains truly unlocks the ability for a company to become data-driven, at scale, both in culture and practice.

This paper aims to highlight the potential role BDA can play to improve groundwater management in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region in Africa. Through a review of the literature, this paper defines the concepts of big data, big data sources in groundwater, big data analytics, big data platforms and framework and how they can be used to support groundwater management in the SADC region. BDA may support groundwater management in SADC region by filling in data gaps and transforming these data into useful information. In recent times, machine learning and artificial intelligence have stood out as a novel tool for data-driven modeling. Managing big data from collection to information delivery requires critical application of selected tools, techniques and methods. Hence, in this paper we present a conceptual framework that can be used to manage the implementation of BDA in a groundwater management context. Then, we highlight challenges limiting the application of BDA which included technological constraints and institutional barriers. In conclusion, the paper shows that sufficient big data exist in groundwater domain and that BDA exists to be used in groundwater sciences thereby providing the basis to further explore data-driven sciences in groundwater management.",,2020.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The European COPERNICUS program provides an unprecedented breakthrough in the broad use and application of satellite remote sensing data. Maintained on a sustainable basis, the COPERNICUS system is operated on a free-and-open data policy. Its guaranteed availability in the long term attracts a broader community to remote sensing applications. In general, the increasing amount of satellite remote sensing data opens the door to the diverse and advanced analysis of this data for earth system science. However, the preparation of the data for dedicated processing is still inefficient as it requires time-consuming operator interaction based on advanced technical skills. Thus, the involved scientists have to spend significant parts of the available project budget rather on data preparation than on science. In addition, the analysis of the rich content of the remote sensing data requires new concepts for better extraction of promising structures and signals as an effective basis for further analysis. In this paper we propose approaches to improve the preparation of satellite remote sensing data by a geo-database. Thus the time needed and the errors possibly introduced by human interaction are minimized. In addition, it is recommended to improve data quality and the analysis of the data by incorporating Artificial Intelligence methods. A use case for data preparation and analysis is presented for earth surface deformation analysis in the Upper Rhine Valley, Germany, based on Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data. Finally, we give an outlook on our future research.",,2020.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

As the world is reopening, the risks of new flare-ups are rising. We report a data-driven approach, grounded in strong correlation between mobility and growth in COVID-19 cases two weeks later, to establish a spatial-temporal model of ""critical mobility"" maps that separate relatively safe mobility levels from dangerous ones. The normalized difference between the current and critical mobility has predictive power for case trajectories during the ""opening-up"" phases. For instance, actual mobility has risen above critical mobility in many southern US counties by the end of May, foreshadowing the latest virus resurgence. Encouragingly, critical mobility has been rising throughout the USA, likely due to face mask-wearing and social distancing measures. However, critical mobility is still well below pre-COVID mobility levels in most of the country suggesting continued mobility-reduction is still necessary.",medRxiv,2020.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Farmers have access to many data-intensive technologies to help them monitor and control weeds and pests. Data collection, data modelling and analysis, and data sharing have become core challenges in weed control and crop protection. We review the challenges and opportunities of Big Data in agriculture: the nature of data collected, Big Data analytics and tools to present the analyses that allow improved crop management decisions for weed control and crop protection. Big Data storage and querying incurs significant challenges, due to the need to distribute data across several machines, as well as due to constantly growing and evolving data from different sources. Semantic technologies are helpful when data from several sources are combined, which involves the challenge of detecting interactions of potential agronomic importance and establishing relationships between data items in terms of meanings and units. Data ownership is analysed using the ethical matrix method to identify the concerns of farmers, agribusiness owners, consumers and the environment. Big Data analytics models are outlined, together with numerical algorithms for training them. Advances and tools to present processed Big Data in the form of actionable information to farmers are reviewed, and a success story from the Netherlands is highlighted. Finally, it is argued that the potential utility of Big Data for weed control is large, especially for invasive, parasitic and herbicide-resistant weeds. This potential can only be realised when agricultural scientists collaborate with data scientists and when organisational, ethical and legal arrangements of data sharing are established.",,2017.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This paper proposes a query processor for Geo-spatial data stored in spatial database and its corresponding query language. The proposed strategy breaks the user given query into two parts, relational and spatial. The relational part involves queries on properties of objects, such as name, population, etc., while the spatial part involves queries on the geometric aspect of objects, such as intersection or union of shapes.

Cloud computing providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure offer immense computing power on demand, but tapping into that power from a robot is non-trivial. In this paper, we present FogROS 2, an easy-to-use, open-source platform to facilitate cloud and fog robotics that is compatible with the emerging Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) standard. FogROS 2 provisions a cloud computer, deploys and launches ROS 2 nodes to the cloud computer, sets up secure networking between the robot and cloud, and starts the application running. FogROS 2 is completely redesigned and distinct from its predecessor to support ROS 2 applications, transparent video compression and communication, improved performance and security, support for multiple cloud-computing providers, and remote monitoring and visualization. We demonstrate in example applications that the performance gained by using cloud computers can overcome the network latency to signiﬁcantly speed up robot performance. In examples, FogROS 2 reduces SLAM latency by 50%, reduces grasp planning time from 14s to 1.2s, and speeds up motion planning 28x.

Despite its immense computing capacity, it is often underused by the robotics and automation community due to lack of expertise in cloud computing and cloud-based infrastructure. Fog Robotics balances computing and data between cloud edge devices. We propose a software framework, FogROS, as an extension of the Robot Operating System (ROS), the defacto standard for creating robot automation applications and components. It allows researchers to deploy components of their software to the cloud with minimal effort, and correspondingly gain access to additional computing cores, GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs, as well as predeployed software made available by other researchers. FogROS allows a researcher to specify which components of their software will be deployed to the cloud and to what type of computing hardware. We evaluate FogROS on 3 examples: (1) simultaneous localization and mapping (ORB-SLAM2), (2) Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) GPU-based grasp planning, and (3) multi-core motion planning using a 96-core cloud-based server. In all three examples, a component is deployed to the cloud and accelerated with a small change in system launch configuration, while incurring additional latency of 1.2 s, 0.6 s, and 0.5 s due to network communication, the computation speed is improved by 2.6×, 6.0× and 34.2×, respectively.

These applications are composed of latency-sensitive, data-heavy, and compute-intensive tasks. The robots, however, are constrained in the computational power and storage capacity. The concept of multi-agent cloud robotics enables robot-to-robot cooperation and creates a complementary environment for the robots in executing large-scale applications with the capability to utilize the edge and cloud resources. However, in such a collaborative environment, the optimal resource allocation for robotic tasks is challenging to achieve. Heterogeneous energy consumption rates and application of execution costs associated with the robots and computing instances make it even more complex. In addition, the data transmission delay between local robots, edge nodes, and cloud data centres adversely affects the real-time interactions and impedes service performance guarantee. Taking all these issues into account, this paper comprehensively surveys the state-of-the-art on resource allocation and service provisioning in multi-agent cloud robotics. The paper presents the application domains of multi-agent cloud robotics through explicit comparison with the contemporary computing paradigms and identifies the specific research challenges.

To deploy computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, traditional approaches have relied on either offloading workload to the remote cloud or optimizing computation at the end device locally. However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant wide-area network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently. In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a distributed DNN computing system that orchestrates cooperative DNN inference over heterogeneous edge devices. CoEdge utilizes available computation and communication resources at the edge and dynamically partitions the DNN inference workload adaptive to devices’ computing capabilities and network conditions. Experimental evaluations based on a realistic prototype show that CoEdge outperforms status-quo approaches in saving energy with close inference latency, achieving up to 25.5% ~ 66.9% energy reduction for four widely-adopted CNN models.",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2020.0,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Existing approaches that only mitigate the covariate shift by aligning the marginal distributions across the domains and assume the conditional distributions to be domain-invariant can lead to ambiguous transfer in real scenarios. We propose to jointly align the marginal (input domains) and the conditional (output labels) distributions to mitigate the covariate and the conditional shift across the domains with adversarial learning, and combine it with a triplet distribution loss to make the conditional distributions disjoint in the shared feature space.

Measuring satisfaction among hearing-impaired students is different than measuring it among common students because they learn using sign language and have different learning styles. An educational courseware for hearing-impaired students is employed to measure this. The courseware uses the Augmented Reality technology and it is called PekAR-Mikroorganisma. Hence, this article focuses on the methodology of measuring and the attributes that contribute to users’ satisfaction. An adaptation of the System Usability Scale was used to identify the satisfaction value. Fifteen hearing-impaired students were employed as a case study. Findings show that the satisfaction level in using PekAR Mikroorganisma is high. It is hoped PekAR-Mikroorganisma can help the hearing-impaired to understand lessons better through the enhancement of their comprehension on abstract concepts.

In this context, designing automatic mechanisms for structured data exchange, that should also ensure the proper development of B2B processes in a regulated environment, becomes a necessity. Even though the data format used for sharing can be modeled using the open methodology, we propose the use of FAIR principles to additionally offer business entities a way to define commonly agreed upon supply, access and ownership procedures. As an approach to manage the FAIR modelled metadata, we propose a series of methodologies to follow. They were integrated in a data marketplace platform, which we developed to ensure they are properly applied. For its design, we modelled a decentralized architecture based on our own blockchain mechanisms. In our proposal, each business entity can host and structure its metadata in catalog, dataset and distribution assets. In order to offer businesses full control over the data supplied through our system, we designed and implemented a sharing mechanism based on access policies defined by the business entity directly in our data marketplace platform. In the proposed approach, metadata-based assets sharing can be done between two or multiple businesses, which will be able to manually access the data in the management interface and programmatically through an authorized data point. Business specific transactions proposed to modify the semantic model are validated using our own blockchain based technologies. As a result, security and integrity of the FAIR data in the collaboration process is ensured. From an architectural point of view, the lack of a central authority to manage the vehiculated data ensures businesses have full control of the terms and conditions under which their data is used.",,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a new paradigm to train machine learning (ML) models in distributed systems, including vehicles in V2X networks. Rather than sharing and uploading the training data to the server, the updating of model parameters (e.g., neural networks’ weights and biases) is applied by large populations of interconnected vehicles, acting as local learners. Despite these beneﬁts, the limitation of existing approaches is the centralized optimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local parameters, leading to the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling issues for increasing V2X network size. Meanwhile, in intelligent transport scenarios, data collected from onboard sensors are redundant, which degrades the performance of aggregation. To tackle these problems, we explore a novel idea of decentralized data processing and introduce a federated learning framework for in-network vehicles, C-DFL( Consensus based Decentralized Federated Learning), to tackle federated learning on connected vehicles and improve learning quality. Extensive simulations have been implemented to evaluate the performance of C-DFL, that demonstrates C-DFL outperforms the performance of conventional methods in all cases.",ArXiv,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Purpose
This study aims to summarize the critical issues in medical federated learning and applicable solutions. Also, detailed explanations of how federated learning techniques can be applied to the medical field are presented. About 80 reference studies described in the field were reviewed, and the federated learning framework currently being developed by the research team is provided. This paper will help researchers to build an actual medical federated learning environment.


Design/methodology/approach
Since machine learning techniques emerged, more efficient analysis was possible with a large amount of data. However, data regulations have been tightened worldwide, and the usage of centralized machine learning methods has become almost infeasible. Federated learning techniques have been introduced as a solution. Even with its powerful structural advantages, there still exist unsolved challenges in federated learning in a real medical data environment. This paper aims to summarize those by category and presents possible solutions.


Findings
This paper provides four critical categorized issues to be aware of when applying the federated learning technique to the actual medical data environment, then provides general guidelines for building a federated learning environment as a solution.


Originality/value
Existing studies have dealt with issues such as heterogeneity problems in the federated learning environment itself, but those were lacking on how these issues incur problems in actual working tasks. Therefore, this paper helps researchers understand the federated learning issues through examples of actual medical machine learning environments.

It requires a voluminous exchange of data for disease prediction via the open communication channel, i.e., the Internet to train artificial intelligence (AI) models efficiently and effectively. The open nature of communication channels puts data privacy at high risk and affects the model training of collected data at centralized servers. To overcome this, an emerging concept, i.e., federated learning (FL) is a viable solution. It performs training at client nodes and aggregates their results to train the global model. The concept of local training preserves the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the patient’s data which contributes effectively to the training process. The applicability of FL in the healthcare domain has various advantages, but it has not been explored to its extent. The existing surveys majorly focused on the role of FL in diverse applications, but there exists no detailed or comprehensive survey on FL in healthcare informatics (HI). We present a relative comparison of recent surveys with the proposed survey. To strengthen healthcare data privacy and increase the QoL of patients, we proposed an FL-based layered healthcare informatics architecture along with the case study on FL-based electronic health records (FL-EHR). We discuss the emerging FL models, and present the statistical and security challenges in FL adoption in medical setups. Thus, the review presents useful insights for both academia and healthcare practitioners to investigate FL application in HI ecosystems.",IEEE Access,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are distinctive spaces protected by law due to their unique characteristics, such as being the habitat of endangered marine species. Even with this protection, there are still illegal activities such as poaching or anchoring that threaten the survival of different marine species. In this context, we propose an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) model system for the surveillance of marine areas by detecting and recognizing vessels through artificial intelligence (AI)-based image recognition services, in search of those carrying out illegal activities. Cloud and edge AI computing technologies were used for computer vision. These technologies have proven to be accurate and reliable in detecting shapes and objects for which they have been trained. Azure edge and cloud vision services offer the best option in terms of accuracy for this task. Due to the lack of 4G and 5G coverage in offshore marine environments, it is necessary to use radio links with a coastal base station to ensure communications, which may result in a high response time due to the high latency involved. The analysis of on-board images may not be sufficiently accurate; therefore, we proposed a smart algorithm for autonomy optimization by selecting the proper AI technology according to the current scenario (SAAO) capable of selecting the best AI source for the current scenario in real time, according to the required recognition accuracy or low latency. The SAAO optimizes the execution, efficiency, risk reduction, and results of each stage of the surveillance mission, taking appropriate decisions by selecting either cloud or edge vision models without human intervention.",Sensors,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Machine Learning (ML)-based advanced control methods have been demonstrated to improve energy efficiency when compared to these traditional methods. However, placing of ML-based models close to the buildings is not straightforward. Firstly, edge-devices typically have lower capabilities in terms of processing power, memory, and storage, which may limit execution of ML-based inference at the edge. Secondly, associated building information should be kept private. Thirdly, network access may be limited for serving a large number of edge devices. The contribution of this paper is an architecture, which enables training of ML-based models for energy consumption prediction in private cloud domain, and transfer of the models to edge nodes for prediction in Kubernetes environment. Additionally, predictors at the edge nodes can be automatically updated without interrupting operation. Performance results with sensor-based devices (Raspberry Pi 4 and Jetson Nano) indicated that a satisfactory prediction latency (~7–9 s) can be achieved within the research context. However, model switching led to an increase in prediction latency (~9–13 s). Partial evaluation of a Reference Architecture for edge computing systems, which was used as a starting point for architecture design, may be considered as an additional contribution of the paper.",Future Internet,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Materials and Methods: We calculated the excess costs of sepsis by comparing patients with and without a secondary sepsis diagnosis but with the same primary diagnosis and baseline comorbidities. We optimized the parameters of a sepsis prediction algorithm across different diagnostic categories to minimize these excess costs. At the optima, we evaluated diagnostic odds ratios and analyzed the impact of compliance factors-like non-compliance, treatment efficacy, and tolerance for false alarms-on the net benefit of triggering sepsis alerts. Results: Compliance factors significantly contributed to the net benefit of triggering a sepsis alert. However, a customized deployment policy can achieve a significantly higher diagnostic odds ratio and reduced costs of sepsis care. Implementing our optimization routine with powerful predictive models could result in $4.6 billion in excess cost savings for the Medicare program. Discussion: Sepsis costs and incidence vary dramatically across diagnostic categories, warranting a customized approach for implementing predictive models. We designed a framework for customizing sepsis alert protocols within different diagnostic categories to minimize excess costs and analyzed model performance as a function of false alarm tolerance and compliance with model recommendations.

Methods: We conducted a review of original studies describing development of specific CDS tools or infrastructures using one of the four targeted standards, regardless of implementation stage. Citations published any time before the literature search was executed on October 21, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed. Two reviewers independently screened articles and abstracted data according to a protocol designed by team consensus. Results: Of 290 articles identified via PubMed search, 44 were included in this study. More than three quarters were published since 2018. Forty-three (98%) used FHIR; 22 (50%) used SMART; two (5%) used CQL; and eight (18%) used CDS Hooks. Twenty-four (55%) were in the design stage, 15 (34%) in the piloting stage, and five (11%) were deployed in a real-world setting. Only 12 (27%) of the articles reported an evaluation of the technology under development. Three of the four articles describing a deployed technology reported an evaluation. Only two evaluations with randomized study components were identified. Conclusion: The diversity of topics and approaches identified in the literature highlights the utility of these standards. The infrequency of reported evaluations, as well as the high number of studies in the design or piloting stage, indicate that these technologies are still early in their life cycles.

Temporal analysis of these data series to discover behavioural patterns may lead to qualified knowledge affecting a broad range of industries. Hence, the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms over IoT data has the potential to improve safety, economy, and performance in critical processes. However, creating ML workflows at scale is a challenging task that depends upon both production and specialized skills. Such tasks require investigation, understanding, selection, and implementation of specific ML workflows, which often lead to bottlenecks, production issues, and code management complexity and even then may not have a final desirable outcome. This paper proposes the Machine Learning Framework for IoT data (ML4IoT), which is designed to orchestrate ML workflows, particularly on large volumes of data series. The ML4IoT framework enables the implementation of several types of ML models, each one with a different workflow. These models can be easily configured and used through a simple pipeline. ML4IoT has been designed to use container-based components to enable training and deployment of various ML models in parallel. The results obtained suggest that the proposed framework can manage real-world IoT heterogeneous data by providing elasticity, robustness, and performance.",IEEE Access,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, due to the diversity of machine learning libraries, the inconsistency between environments, and various scalability requirement, there is no existing work to date that addresses all of these challenges. Here, we introduce Bighead, a framework-agnostic, end-to-end platform for machine learning. It offers a seamless user experience requiring only minimal efforts that span feature set management, prototyping, training, batch (offline) inference, real-time (online) inference, evaluation, and model lifecycle management. In contrast to existing platforms, it is designed to be highly versatile and extensible, and supports all major machine learning frameworks, rather than focusing on one particular framework. It ensures consistency across different environments and stages of the model lifecycle, as well as across data sources and transformations. It scales horizontally and elastically in response to the workload such as dataset size and throughput. Its components include a feature management framework, a model development toolkit, a lifecycle management service with UI, an offline training and inference engine, an online inference service, an interactive prototyping environment, and a Docker image customization tool. It is the first platform to offer a feature management component that is a general-purpose aggregation framework with lambda architecture and temporal joins. Bighead is deployed and widely adopted at Airbnb, and has enabled the data science and engineering teams to develop and deploy machine learning models in a timely and reliable manner. Bighead has shortened the time to deploy a new model from months to days, ensured the stability of the models in production, facilitated adoption of cutting-edge models, and enabled advanced machine learning based product features of the Airbnb platform.

They have proven to be a more effective, accessible and cheaper solution compared to crewed aircraft. However, the ability to reliably detect and identify marine fauna is closely tied to pilot skill, experience and level of fatigue. Modern computer vision technology offers the possibility of improving detection reliability and even automating the surveillance process in the future. In this work we investigate the ability of commodity deep learning algorithms to detect marine objects in video footage from drones, with a focus on distinguishing between shark species. This study was enabled by the large archive of video footage gathered during the NSW Department of Primary Industries Drone Trials since 2016. We used this data to train two neural networks, based on the ResNet-50 and MobileNet V1 architectures, to detect and identify ten classes of marine object in 1080p resolution video footage. Both networks are capable of reliably detecting dangerous sharks: 80% accuracy for RetinaNet-50 and 78% for MobileNet V1 when tested on a challenging external dataset, which compares well to human observers. The object detection models correctly detect and localise most objects, produce few false-positive detections and can successfully distinguish between species of marine fauna in good conditions. We find that shallower network architectures, like MobileNet V1, tend to perform slightly worse on smaller objects, so care is needed when selecting a network to match deployment needs. We show that inherent biases in the training set have the largest effect on reliability. Some of these biases can be mitigated by pre-processing the data prior to training, however, this requires a large store of high resolution images that supports augmentation. A key finding is that models need to be carefully tuned for new locations and water conditions. Finally, we built an Android mobile application to run inference on real-time streaming video and demonstrated a working prototype during fields trials run in partnership with Surf Life Saving NSW.",Frontiers in Marine Science,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

We quantified sharks in 36,384 drone flights across 42 ocean beaches from 2017 to 2021. Overall, there were 347 chondrichthyans recorded, comprising 281 (81.0%) sharks, with observations occurring in <1% of flights. Whaler sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) had the highest number of observations (n = 158) recorded. There were 34 individuals observed for both white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and critically endangered greynurse sharks (Carcharias taurus). Bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), leopard sharks (Stegostoma tigrinum) and hammerhead species (Sphyrna spp.) recorded 29, eight and three individuals, respectively. Generalised additive models were used to identify environmental drivers for detection probability of white, bull, greynurse, and whaler sharks. Distances to the nearest estuary, headland, and island, as well as water temperature and wave height, were significant predictors of shark occurrence; however, this varied among species. Overall, we provide valuable information for evidence-based species-specific conservation and management strategies for coastal sharks.",Biology,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

UAVs can also be adopted in construction for pre-planning, proper surveying of the given area, checking or inspecting site safety and quality monitoring. Based on these envisaged uses, this study is set to assess the benefits of UAVs usage in the construction industry. This was achieved through a detailed literature review combined with empirical data analysis. Data was retrieved through questionnaire survey distributed to professionals randomly in the South African construction industry. The retrieved data was analysed using descriptive and inferential data analysis methods. Findings revealed that UAVs adoption in the construction industry will lead to reduction in worker’s injury as it will be implemented for monitoring of workers activities on site. It was also revealed that UAVs are useful in on-site asset tracking which allows stakeholders to have real-time information on the construction project from anywhere. The study concluded that the efficiency in the performance of the construction industry can be achieved through the adoption of UAVs in the different stages of construction projects.",Modular and Offsite Construction (MOC) Summit Proceedings,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, monitoring wildlife populations poses economic and logistic challenges especially in complex and remote habitats. Declines in wildlife populations can remain undetected for years unless effective monitoring techniques are developed, guiding appropriate management actions. We developed an automated survey workflow using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to quantify the number and size of individual animals, using the well-studied Scandinavian harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) as a model species. We compared ground-based counts using telescopes with manual flights, using a zoom photo/video, and pre-programmed flights producing orthomosaic photo maps. We used machine learning to identify and count both pups and older seals and we present a new method for measuring body size automatically. We evaluate the population’s reproductive success using drone data, historical counts and predictions from a Leslie matrix population model. The most accurate and time-efficient results were achieved by performing pre-programmed flights where individual seals are identified by machine learning and their body sizes are measured automatically. The accuracy of the machine learning detector was 95–97% and the classification error was 4.6 ± 2.9 for pups and 3.1 ± 2.1 for older seals during good light conditions. There was a clear distinction between the body sizes of pups and older seals during breeding time. We estimated 320 pups in the breeding season 2021 with the drone, which is well beyond the expected number, based on historical data on pup production. The new high quality data from the drone survey confirms earlier indications of a deteriorating reproductive rate in this important harbour seal colony. We show that aerial drones and machine learning are powerful tools for monitoring wildlife in inaccessible areas which can be used to assess annual recruitment and seasonal variations in body condition.

Here we discuss a novel approach to an ongoing problem, in which actions to reduce risk to humans, involve lethal control of otherwise protected species. To protect water users, nets are often used to catch potentially dangerous sharks at popular bathing beaches, yet in Australian waters one of the targeted species, the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is listed as Vulnerable, while bycatch includes the Critically Endangered grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus). Recent, highly publicised, shark attacks have triggered demands for improved bather protection, whilst welfare and conservation organisations have called for removal of lethal measures. This leaves management and policy makers with a wicked problem: removing nets to reduce impacts on threatened species may increase risk to humans; or leaving the program as it is on the premise that the benefits provided by bather protection are greater than the impact on threatened and protected species. We used multivariate analysis and generalised additive models to investigate the biological, spatial-temporal, and environmental patterns influencing catch rates of threatened and of potentially dangerous shark species in the New South Wales shark nets over two decades to April 2019. Factors influencing catches were used to develop a matrix of potential changes to reduce catch of threatened species. Our proposed solutions include replacing existing nets with alternative mitigation strategies at key beaches where catch rate of threatened species is high. This approach provides stakeholders with a hierarchy of scenarios that address both social demands and threatened species conservation and is broadly applicable to human-wildlife conflict scenarios elsewhere.",Frontiers in Conservation Science,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

A thorough literature study is first undertaken to have the set of influencing factors that should be suitable for the investigation from the perspective of designing and selecting civilian drones. Several rounds of surveys using the Delphi method, followed by an analytic hierarchy process (AHP), are performed to conform to the organized tree structure of constructs and factors and to obtain the knowledge about the opinions of the expert groups, with the expert sample being intentionally partitioned into three opinion groups at the beginning: academia (A), industry (I), and research institutes (R). Doing so facilitates a “mind-mining” process using the triple helix model (THM), while the opinions across the groups can also be visualized and compared. This exploits a new set of knowledge for the design and selection of civilian drones on a scientific yet empirical basis, and the observed differences and similarities among the groups may benefit their future negotiations to propose the drafts for regulating the design, manufacturing, and uses of civilian drones.

There is a growing acceptance of the use of drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs and remotely piloted aircraft systems, RPAS) to detect wildlife, largely because of the capacity for drones to rapidly cover large areas compared to ground survey methods. While drones can aid the capture of large amounts of imagery, detection requires either manual evaluation of the imagery or automated detection using machine learning algorithms. While manual evaluation of drone‐acquired imagery is possible and sometimes necessary, the powerful combination of drones with automated detection of wildlife in this imagery is much faster and, in some cases, more accurate than using human observers. Despite the great potential of this emerging approach, most attention to date has been paid to the development of algorithms, and little is known about the constraints around successful detection (P. W. J. Baxter, and G. Hamilton, 2018, Ecosphere, 9, e02194). We reviewed studies that were conducted over the last 5 years in which wildlife species were detected automatically in drone‐acquired imagery to understand how technological constraints, environmental conditions and ecological traits of target species impact detection with automated methods. From this review, we found that automated detection could be achieved for a wider range of species and under a greater variety of environmental conditions than reported in previous reviews of automated and manual detection in drone‐acquired imagery. A high probability of automated detection could be achieved efficiently using fixed‐wing platforms and RGB sensors for species that were large and occurred in open and homogeneous environments with little vegetation or variation in topography while infrared sensors and multirotor platforms were necessary to successfully detect small, elusive species in complex habitats. The insight gained in this review could allow conservation managers to use drones and machine learning algorithms more accurately and efficiently to conduct abundance data on vulnerable populations that is critical to their conservation.",Methods in Ecology and Evolution,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

As such, collecting robust, accurate datasets in a time-efficient manner is an ever-present pressure for the field of behavioural ecology. Faced with the shortcomings and physical limitations of traditional ground-based data collection techniques, particularly in marine studies, drones offer a low-cost and efficient approach for collecting data in a range of coastal environments. Despite drones being widely used to monitor a range of marine animals, they currently remain underutilised in ray research. The innovative application of drones in environmental and ecological studies has presented novel opportunities in animal observation and habitat assessment, although this emerging field faces substantial challenges. As we consider the possibility to monitor rays using drones, we face challenges related to local aviation regulations, the weather and environment, as well as sensor and platform limitations. Promising solutions continue to be developed, however, growing the potential for drone-based monitoring of behaviour and habitat use of rays.

Drones have shown significant value for animals that were often difficult or dangerous to study using traditional survey methods. In the past five years drone technology has become commonplace for shark research with their use above, and more recently, below the water helping to minimise knowledge gaps about these cryptic species. Drones have enhanced our understanding of shark behaviour and are critically important tools, not only due to the importance and conservation of the animals in the ecosystem, but to also help minimise dangerous encounters with humans. To provide some guidance for their future use in relation to sharks, this review provides an overview of how drones are currently used with critical context for shark monitoring. We show how drones have been used to fill knowledge gaps around fundamental shark behaviours or movements, social interactions, and predation across multiple species and scenarios. We further detail the advancement in technology across sensors, automation, and artificial intelligence that are improving our abilities in data collection and analysis and opening opportunities for shark-related beach safety.

Temperate estuarine landscapes, such as the Rachel Carson Reserve (RCR) in Beaufort, NC, are dynamic habitat mosaics that experience fluctuations in physical and chemical oceanographic properties on various temporal and spatial scales. These patterns in abiotic conditions play an important role in determining species movement. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of environmental conditions around the RCR on shark density within the high-abundance summer season. Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) surveys of coastal habitats within the reserve were used to quantify shark density across varying environmental conditions. A combination of correlation analyses and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) revealed that density differs substantially across study sites and increases with rising water temperatures, conclusions that are supported by previous work in similar habitats. Additionally, density appears to increase moving towards dawn and dusk, potentially supporting crepuscular activity in coastal estuarine areas. By describing shark density dynamics in the RCR, this study provides new information on this population and presents a novel framework for studying elasmobranchs in temperate estuaries.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, their movement ecology in high-energy surf areas remains largely unknown due to the notorious difficulties in conducting research in these environments. Using a blimp as an aerial platform for video surveillance, we overcame some of the limitations of other tracking methods, such as the use of tags and drones. This novel technology offered near-continuous coverage to characterise the fine-scale movements of stingrays in a surf area in Kiama, Australia, without any invasive procedures. A total of 98 stingray tracks were recorded, providing 6 h 27 min of movement paths. The tracking data suggest that stingrays may use a depth gradient located in the sandflat area of the bay for orientating their movements and transiting between locations within their home range. Our research also indicates that stingray behaviour was influenced by diel periods and tidal states. We observed a higher stingray occurrence during the afternoon, potentially related to foraging and anti-predatory strategies. We also saw a reduced route fidelity during low tide, when the bathymetric reference was less accessible due to stranding risk. Considering the increasing threat of anthropogenic development to nearshore coastal environments, the identification of these patterns can better inform the management and mitigation of threats.",Fishes,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Based on this advantage, it can push the service closer to the user. Our research group is concerned with implementing the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled massive crowd management platform that employs 5G to facilitate network connectivity among the UAV and sensory networks. In such a highly dynamic environment, IoT devices, users, and UAVs are the key factors to determine the caching strategies. Due to the limitations of drone batteries and changes in UAV cluster density, the environment is characterized as highly dynamic. However, the existing UAV caching strategy does not consider both the changes of the users and UAVs. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-layer UAV cache architecture in 5G network to achieve hierarchical adaptation to the dynamic changes of users and UAVs. Based on this architecture, we propose a dual dynamic adaptive caching(DDAC) algorithm. The DDAC algorithm is divided into two parts: user adaptation and UAV adaptation. For user adaptation, we designed a user-adaptive UAV trajectory model, which ensures the transmission efficiency of the UAV. For UAV adaptation, we designed and deployed a UAV-adaptive cache model based on a greedy algorithm in the cognitive center layer. The UAV can dynamically adjust the caching strategy according to the cluster density. Finally, the results of the experiment prove that our proposed UAV adaptive cache model has better performance in the cache hit ratio compared with the existing UAV cache model.",2021 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, despite the great development and huge contributions in improving the infrastructure of the facilities, the problem of crowd control and congestion still remains a real challenge to the management.

Free-viewpoint video, as one of the interactive video applications, can provide users with immersion of real world scenes, and shows potential to be an essential application in future digital life. However, such an application is different from other video services in aspects of computation and communication features, and existing researches are not up to the low frame latency, smooth playback, and high service scalability challenges. In this paper, we target on the above problems, and achieve ultra-low latency and stable video transmission for free-viewpoint video services by improving the performance of multiple system components accordingly. Firstly, the key performance indicator is formulated for such services, and an edge computing based video transmission schema is proposed to achieve ultra-low frame latency. Secondly, a pair of stabilization algorithms at both server and client sides based on application features are introduced to ensure stable encoded video streams before transmission, and smooth playback after that. Thirdly, a cloud-edge-client hybrid free-viewpoint service architecture is proposed, which can provide hierarchical experiences and enlarge the service scale with restricted resources. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed transmission schema and scheduling algorithms, and feasibility of the proposed service architecture is revealed by qualitative analyses.",IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, these cameras are usually equipped with heterogeneous and turbulent networks, making the real-time smooth playback of traffic monitoring videos with high quality a grand challenge. In this article, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning-based approach, namely, sRC-C (smart bitRate Control with a Continuous action space), to enhance the quality of real-time traffic monitoring by adjusting the video bitrate adaptively. Distinguished from the existing bitrate adjusting approaches, sRC-C can overcome the bias incurred by deterministic discretization of candidate bitrates by adjusting the video bitrate with more fine-grained control from a continuous action space, thus significantly improving the Quality-of-Service (QoS). With carefully designed state space and neural network model, sRC-C can be implemented on cameras with scarce resources to support real-time live video streaming with low inference time. Extensive experiments show that sRC-C can reduce the frame loss counts and hold time by 24% and 15.5%, respectively, even with comparable bandwidth utilization. Meanwhile, compared to the-state-of-art approaches, sRC-C can improve the QoS by 30.4%.",ACM Trans. Sens. Networks,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Edge computing significantly reduces network latency. However, in mobility scenarios, the user will frequently move out of the edge server's coverage area, requiring frequent migration of the game instance. This paper presents Talaria, an in-engine content synchronisation solution for unnoticeable game instance migration between edge servers. Talaria creates a minimal instance with content immediately relevant to the game experience, allowing the client to switch servers in a minimal amount of time. The remaining content is then synchronised according to priority until the game's state is coherent between both instances. Our implementation of Talaria as a Unity engine plugin reduces the game's downtime by 61% compared to one-off server migration, with an average latency below 25 ms for the server migration, and 87 ms for the entire game synchronisation.",CoNEXT,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In this article, we study the performance of different screen-sharing technologies, which can be classified into native and clientless ones. The native ones dictate that users install special-purpose software, while the clientless ones directly run in web browsers. In particular, we conduct extensive experiments in three steps. First, we identify a suite of the most representative native and clientless screen-sharing technologies. Second, we propose a systematic measurement methodology for comparing screen-sharing technologies under diverse and dynamic network conditions using different performance metrics. Last, we conduct extensive experiments and perform in-depth analysis to quantify the performance gap between clientless and native screen-sharing technologies. We found that our WebRTC-based implementation achieves the best overall performance. More precisely, it consumes a maximum of 3 Mbps bandwidth while reaching a high decoding ratio and delivering good video quality. Moreover, it leads to a steadily high decoding ratio and video quality under dynamic network conditions. By presenting the very first rigorous comparisons of the native and clientless screen-sharing technologies, this article will stimulate more exciting studies on the emerging clientless screen-sharing technologies.",ACM Trans.

However, most algorithms, either rules-based or learning-driven approaches, feed throughput traces or classified traces based on traditional statistics (i.e., mean/standard deviation) to drive ABR decision, leading to compromised performances in specific scenarios. Given the diverse network connections (e.g., WiFi, cellular and wired link) from time to time, this paper thus proposes to learn the ANT (a.k.a., Accurate Network Throughput) model to characterize the full spectrum of network throughput dynamics in the past for deriving the proper network condition associated with a specific cluster of network throughput segments (NTS). Each cluster of NTS is then used to generate a dedicated ABR model, by which we wish to better capture the network dynamics for diverse connections. We have integrated the ANT model with existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based ABR decision engine, where different ABR models are applied to respond to the accurate network sensing for better rate decision. Extensive experiment results show that our approach can significantly improve the user QoE by 65.5% and 31.3% respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art Pensive and Oboe, across a wide range of network scenarios.

Understanding the characteristics of these platforms can benefit both the game viewers and the platform. However, the live game streaming platforms in China, which has the largest game market in terms of both the revenue and the total number of gamers in the world, are still under the veil of mystery. In this paper, we present an initial investigation on Douyu, the largest live game streaming platform in China. We inferred the platform's architecture and workflow by analyzing the captured traffic and crawled data. Moreover, we investigated the statistics and patterns from both the broadcasters' and viewers' perspectives. Compared with the world-wide live game streaming platform Twitch, the regional platform Douyu has more regular daily changes in online channels, which can provide insights for resource provisioning in the future system optimization. Based on the measurement, it is found that the top 7.5 % of games have attracted 79.5 % viewer's attention. Moreover, the number of mobile viewers have exceeded the number of PC viewers, taking up about 64.8 % of the total viewer number. As the most popular mobile game in China, the game Arena of Valor (referred to as wzry in Douyu) has more than 4,500 simultaneous online broadcasters and accounting for 12.7% of the overall attention.","2020 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)",2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In this paper, we propose an adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm to achieve improvement of the timevarying QoE determinants during a mobile video playback. Since watching videos will bring mobile data charges to the users, the traffic consumed by video downloads should be customized to a user-specified amount. To this end, we first analyze the real-world traces, and find the key factors to formulate a continuous QoE model. Then, we introduce a traffic-aware rate adaptation strategy (TARA). Given that users are aware of their real-time capabilities when watching a mobile video, TARA enables robust ABR process which can satisfy users’ requirements with traffic constraints. Finally, a centralized reinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed for the joint optimization of TARA, which aims to maximize the designed QoE metric, and deliver the expected viewing experience to users. Results of experiments driven by both the simulated, and real-world network traces reveal the efficiency of the proposed TARA strategy, and demonstrate its signicant performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art ABR algorithms.",IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Cloud gaming offloads computation-intensive tasks to the cloud in order to alleviate the computational burden of end-users’ devices, but introduces delay which deteriorates their Quality of Experience (QoE). To solve the optimization problem of rendering service allocation with QoE guarantees and reduce the operational expenditures of game providers, fog computing is deemed a promising solution. However, the optimization problem is NP-hard since it falls into the category of the well-known Facility Location Problems. In the current paper, a distributed policy is proposed, named QoE-Aware Rendering Service Allocation (QoERSA), which takes advantage of strictly local network information, to reallocate the rendering services inside the fog computing network, towards an optimal delay-sensitive placement, given the QoE gaming constraints and the need for capital investment reduction. To this end, it employs Mean Opinion Score objective QoE assessment and simple mechanics that move, copy and merge services with high elasticity and scalability. QoERSA is evaluated through simulations that highlight its efficiency and showcase its capability of overall service access and deployment cost reduction.","2020 5th South-East Europe Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference (SEEDA-CECNSM)",2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

To overcome this issue, most of rate adaptation schemes are proposed based on the users’ Field of View (FoV), since users only view part of the entire videos when watching 360-degree videos. However, the FoV prediction is only valid in short terms which incurs low robustness against network dynamics and results in frozen screen events. Since the playback buffer can effectively avoid re-buffering by storing videos in advance, we propose a two-layered hierarchical buffer-based rate adaptation scheme for 360-degree VR videos in this paper. The tiles will be updated to enhance the video quality in the short buffer layer based on FoV prediction, meanwhile the long buffer layer takes charge of downloading new chunks to guarantee the buffer occupancy. To better improve the quality of experience (QoE), we jointly consider the users’ FoV, channel conditions and buffer status. Our method achieves a good trade-off between video quality and buffer occupancy. Besides, the maximum buffer level selection is optimized to further improve the performance. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme and algorithms outperform other methods by about 5%-30% of QoE improvement.",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Materials and Methods: We calculated the excess costs of sepsis by comparing patients with and without a secondary sepsis diagnosis but with the same primary diagnosis and baseline comorbidities. We optimized the parameters of a sepsis prediction algorithm across different diagnostic categories to minimize these excess costs. At the optima, we evaluated diagnostic odds ratios and analyzed the impact of compliance factors-like non-compliance, treatment efficacy, and tolerance for false alarms-on the net benefit of triggering sepsis alerts. Results: Compliance factors significantly contributed to the net benefit of triggering a sepsis alert. However, a customized deployment policy can achieve a significantly higher diagnostic odds ratio and reduced costs of sepsis care. Implementing our optimization routine with powerful predictive models could result in $4.6 billion in excess cost savings for the Medicare program. Discussion: Sepsis costs and incidence vary dramatically across diagnostic categories, warranting a customized approach for implementing predictive models. We designed a framework for customizing sepsis alert protocols within different diagnostic categories to minimize excess costs and analyzed model performance as a function of false alarm tolerance and compliance with model recommendations.

However, the prolonged pandemic has revealed confounding problems with the current face masks, including not only the spread of the disease but also concurrent psychological, social, and economic complications. As face masks have been worn for a long time, people have been interested in expanding the purpose of masks from protection to comfort and health, leading to the release of various “smart” mask products around the world.

While most smart masks presented in the market focus on resolving problems with user breathing discomfort, which arise from prolonged use, academic prototypes were designed for not only sensing COVID-19 but also general health monitoring aspects. Further, we investigated several specific sensors that can be incorporated into the mask for expanding biophysical features. On a larger scale, we discussed the architecture and possible applications with the help of connected smart masks. Namely, beyond a personal sensing application, a group or community sensing application may share an aggregate version of information with the broader population. In addition, this kind of collaborative sensing will also address the challenges of individual sensing, such as reliability and coverage. Lastly, we identified possible service application fields and further considerations for actual use. Along with daily-life health monitoring, smart masks may function as a general respiratory health tool for sports training, in an emergency room or ambulatory setting, as protection for industry workers and firefighters, and for soldier safety and survivability. For further considerations, we investigated design aspects in terms of sensor reliability and reproducibility, ergonomic design for user acceptance, and privacy-aware data-handling. Overall, we aim to explore new possibilities by examining the latest research, sensor technologies, and application platform perspectives for smart masks as one of the promising wearable devices. By integrating biomarkers of respiration symptoms, a smart mask can be a truly cutting-edge device that expands further knowledge on health monitoring to reach the next level of wearables.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The authors conclude that large-scale randomized trials are needed to confirm their observations, but assert that their findings indicate the potential for the TREWS system to identify sepsis patients early and improve patient outcomes, including a significant decrease in mortality. However, this conclusion is based upon a comparison of those whose alert was confirmed vs. not confirmed within 3 hours, rather than random allocation to TREWS vs. no TREWS.

Several machine and deep learning approaches have been proposed recently for detecting various types of aggressive behavior. However, social media are fast paced, generating an increasing amount of content, while aggressive behavior evolves over time. In this work, we introduce the first, practical, real-time framework for detecting aggression on Twitter via embracing the streaming machine learning paradigm. Our method adapts its ML classifiers in an incremental fashion as it receives new annotated examples and is able to achieve the same (or even higher) performance as batch-based ML models, with over 90% accuracy, precision, and recall. At the same time, our experimental analysis on real Twitter data reveals how our framework can easily scale to accommodate the entire Twitter Firehose (of 778 million tweets per day) with only 3 commodity machines. Finally, we show that our framework is general enough to detect other related behaviors such as sarcasm, racism, and sexism in real time.",2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The digital pathology platform can make the pathological resources digital and networked, and realize the permanent storage of visual data and the synchronous browsing processing without the limitation of time and space. It has been widely used in various fields of pathology. However, there is still a lack of an open and universal digital pathology platform to assist doctors in the management and analysis of digital pathological sections, as well as the management and structured description of relevant patient information. Most platforms cannot integrate image viewing, annotation and analysis, and text information management. To solve the above problems, we propose a comprehensive and extensible platform, PIMIP (Pathology Information Management & Integration Platform). PIMIP has developed the image annotation functions based on the visualization of digital pathological sections. Our annotation functions support multi-user collaborative annotation and multi-device annotation, and realize the automation of some annotation tasks. In the annotation task, we invited a professional pathologist for guidance. We introduce a machine learning module for image analysis. The data we collected included public data from local hospitals and clinical examples. Our platform is more clinical and suitable for clinical use. In addition to image data, we also structured the management and display of text information. So our platform is comprehensive. The platform framework is built in a modular way to support users to add machine learning modules independently, which makes our platform extensible.",2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Unfortunately, generating these annotations is a cumbersome and laborious process, due to the large amount of time and effort needed. Here we present a deep-learning-based iterative digital pathology annotation tool that is both easy to use by pathologists and easy to integrate into machine vision systems. Our pathology image annotation tool greatly reduces annotation time from hours to a few minutes, while maintaining high fidelity with human-expert manual annotations. Here we demonstrate that our active learning tool can be used for a variety of pathology annotation tasks including masking tumor, stroma, and lymphocyte-rich regions, among others. This annotation automation system was validated on 90 unseen digital pathology images with tumor content from the CAMELYON16 database and it was found that pathologists’ gold standard masks were re-produced successfully using our tool. That is, an average of 2.7 positive selections (mouse clicks) and 8.0 negative selections (mouse clicks) were sufficient to generate tumor masks similar to pathologists’ gold standard in CAMELYON16 test WSIs. Furthermore, the developed image annotation tool has been used to build gold standard masks for hundreds of TCGA digital pathology images. This set was used to train a convolutional neural network for identification of tumor epithelium. The developed pan-cancer deep neural network was then tested on TCGA and internal data with comparable performance. The validated pathology image annotation tool described herein has the potential to be of great value in facilitating accurate, rapid pathological analysis of tumor biopsies.",bioRxiv,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Currently, M&V procedures and calculation methods exist for the assessment of Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) for existing buildings, with a focus on reliable baseline model creation and savings estimation, as well as for reducing the computation time, uncertainties, and M&V costs. There is limited application of rigorous M&V procedures in the design, delivery and operation of low/zero energy dwellings and settlements. In the present paper, M&V for four pilot net-zero energy settlements has been designed and implemented. The M&V has been planned, incorporating guidance from existing protocols, linked to the project development phases, and populated with lessons learned through implementation. The resulting framework demonstrates that M&V is not strictly linked to the operational phase of a project but is rather an integral part of the project management and development. Under this scope, M&V is an integrated, iterative process that is accompanied by quality control in every step. Quality control is a significant component of the M&V, and the proposed quality control procedures can support the preparation and implementation of automated M&V. The proposed framework can be useful to project managers for integrating M&V into the project management and development process and explicitly aligning it with the rest of the design and construction procedures.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This study used the methodology of systematic literature review and text mining analysis. The main findings showed that the primary goal of EC is to reduce the time required to transfer large amounts of data. With the ability to analyze data at the edge, it is possible to obtain immediate feedback and use it in the decision-making process. However, the implementation of EC requires investments not only in infrastructure, but also in the development of employee knowledge related to modern computing methods based on artificial intelligence. As the results of the analyses showed, great importance is also attached to energy consumption, both in ongoing production processes and for the purposes of data transmission and analysis. This paper also highlights problems related to quality management. Based on the analyses, we indicate further research directions for the application of edge computing and associated technologies that are required in the area of intelligent resource scheduling (for flexible production systems and autonomous systems), anomaly detection and resulting decision making, data analysis and transfer, knowledge management (for smart designing), and simulations (for autonomous systems).",Sensors,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The advancement of Deep Learning (DL) methodologies is one of the key driving forces for CAVs, allowing elaborating a massive amount of data by the resource-constrained onboard devices. In a traditional centralized DL approach, vehicle data are transmitted to the cloud for the training of models. This approach leads to significant communication overhead, high delays, and data privacy concerns. Conversely, Federated Learning (FL) performs the training using the local models in a distributed fashion and mitigates the data privacy risks by sharing only the model parameters with the server, optimizing the FL to be used with resources-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a scalable communication infrastructure to support the FL procedure based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) using Apache Kafka, called KafkaFed. The ICN-based infrastructure allows to overcome the shortcomings of current client-server architectures for FL, in which routing is content-based or name-based to achieve efficient data retrieval for mobile nodes. In ICN, data are stored at intermediate nodes to provide efficient and reliable data delivery. A proof of concept of the KafkaFed communication architecture is developed and tested in an emulated environment. The performance of the proposed framework compared to the client server-based FL architecture, i.e., FLOWER showed a boost of almost 40% with just 32 clients in addition to several other advantages of scalability, reliability, and security",2022 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops and other Affiliated Events (PerCom Workshops),2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The availability of data is advantageous for asset management, however, attempts to maximise the value of this data often fall short due to additional constraints, such as privacy concerns and data stored in distributed silos that is difficult to access and share. Federated Learning (FL) has been explored to address these challenges and has been demonstrated to provide a mechanism that allows highly distributed data to be mined in a privacy-preserving manner and offering new opportunities for a collaborative approach to asset management. Despite the benefits, FL has some challenges that need to be overcome to make it fully compatible for asset management or more specifically predictive maintenance applications. FL requires a set of clients that participate in the model training process, however, orchestration, device heterogeneity and scalability can hinder the speed and accuracy in the context of collaborative predictive maintenance. To address this challenge, this work proposes a split-learning-based framework (SplitPred) that enables FL clients to maximise available resources within their local network without compromising the benefits of a FL approach (i.e., privacy and shared learning). Experiments performed on the benchmark C-MAPSS data-set demonstrate the advantage of applying SplitPred in the FL process in terms of efficient use of resources, i.e., model convergence time, accuracy, and network load.",IEEE Access,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Secondly, according to the inspection results and actual situation, the optimal coping strategy is formulated to minimize the loss of life and property security of the country and the society by using the optimization principle and the objective management in management science. Finally, the statistical analysis method and the six sigma principle are combined to develop a feedback mechanism to evaluate whether the formulated coping strategies can achieve the expected results in practice.

Since event data related to major conflicts are usually obtained from different sources, researchers developed a semi‐automatic matching algorithm to integrate event data of different origins into one comprehensive dataset using hierarchical taxonomies. The validity of the corresponding integration results is not easy to assess since the results depend on user‐defined input parameters and the relationships between the original data sources. However, only rudimentary visualization techniques have been used so far to analyze the results, allowing no trustworthy validation or exploration of how the final dataset is composed. To overcome this problem, we developed VEHICLE, a web‐based tool to validate and explore the results of the hierarchical integration. For the design, we collaborated with a domain expert to identify the underlying domain problems and derive a task and workflow description. The tool combines both traditional and novel visual analysis techniques, employing statistical and map‐based depictions as well as advanced interaction techniques. We showed the usefulness of VEHICLE in two case studies and by conducting an evaluation together with conflict researchers, confirming domain hypotheses and generating new insights.",Comput. Graph.

Although sentiment analysis and emotion classification are used commonly in applications such as analyzing customer reviews, the popularity of candidates contesting in elections, and comments about various sporting events; however, in this study, we have examined their application for epidemic outbreak detection. Early outbreak detection is the key to deal with epidemics effectively, however, the traditional ways of outbreak detection are time-consuming which inhibits prompt response from the respective departments. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. allow the users to express their thoughts related to different aspects of life, and therefore, serve as a substantial source of information in such situations. The proposed study exploits the bilingual (Urdu and English) data from Twitter and NEWS websites related to the dengue epidemic in Pakistan, and sentiment analysis and emotion classification are performed to acquire deep insights from the data set for gaining a fair idea related to an epidemic outbreak. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used to train and implement the models for the execution of both tasks. The comparative performance of each model has been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-measure. Based on the acquired accuracy measure, the performance of deep learning models was found out to be better than the performance of machine learning models. Besides, the comparative performance of one-vs-rest and multiclass classifiers is also analyzed in this paper and expressed in terms of the weighted average of precision and weighted average of recall. Our results indicated that the multiclass classifiers had a higher value of weighted recall, whereas, the one-vs-rest classifiers had a higher value of weighted precision.",ArXiv,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In the era of technology, adopting informatics‐based solutions is essential. The main objective of this study is to propose a conceptual framework to provide a rapid and responsive surveillance system against pandemics. Methods A three‐step approach was employed in this research to develop a conceptual framework. These three steps comprise (1) literature review, (2) extracting and coding concepts, and determining main themes based on thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti® software, and (3) mapping concepts. Later, all of the results synthesized under expert consultation to design a conceptual framework based on the main themes and identified strategies related to medical informatics. Results In the literature review phase, 65 articles were identified as eligible studies for analysis. Through line by line coding in thematic analysis, more than 46 themes were extracted as potential foremost themes. Based on the key themes and strategies were employed by studies, the proposed framework designed in three main components. The most appropriate strategies that can be used in each section were identified based on the demands of each part and the available solutions. These solutions were employed in the final framework. Conclusion The presented model in this study can be the first step for a better understanding of the potential of medical informatics solutions in promoting epidemic disease management. It can be applied as a reference model for designing intelligent surveillance systems to prepare for probable future pandemics.",The International journal of health planning and management,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Prevention aims at advocating behaviour and policy changes likely to improve human health. Public health strives to limit the outbreak of acute diseases as well as the reduction of chronic diseases and injuries. For this purpose, data are collected to identify trends in human health, to derive hypotheses, e.g. related to risk factors, and to get insights in the data and the underlying phenomena. Most public health data have a temporal character. Moreover, the spatial character, e.g. spatial clustering of diseases, needs to be considered for decision‐making. Visual analytics techniques involve (subspace) clustering, interaction techniques to identify relevant subpopulations, e.g. being particularly vulnerable to diseases, imputation of missing values, visual queries as well as visualization and interaction techniques for spatio‐temporal data. We describe requirements, tasks and visual analytics techniques that are widely used in public health before going into detail with respect to applications. These include outbreak surveillance and epidemiology research, e.g. cancer epidemiology. We classify the solutions based on the visual analytics techniques employed.

The advancement of technology has made health-related data and other indicator activities easily accessible for syndromic surveillance of various datasets. At the heart of disease surveillance lies the clustering algorithm, which groups data with similar characteristics (spatial, temporal, or both) to uncover significant disease outbreak. Despite these developments, there is a lack of updated reviews of trends and modelling options in cluster detection algorithms. Objective Our purpose was to systematically review practically implemented disease surveillance clustering algorithms relating to temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal clustering mechanisms for their usage and performance efficacies, and to develop an efficient cluster detection mechanism framework. Methods We conducted a systematic review exploring Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus. Between January and March 2018, we conducted the literature search for articles published to date in English in peer-reviewed journals. The main eligibility criteria were studies that (1) examined a practically implemented syndromic surveillance system with cluster detection mechanisms, including over-the-counter medication, school and work absenteeism, and disease surveillance relating to the presymptomatic stage; and (2) focused on surveillance of infectious diseases. We identified relevant articles using the title, keywords, and abstracts as a preliminary filter with the inclusion criteria, and then conducted a full-text review of the relevant articles. We then developed a framework for cluster detection mechanisms for various syndromic surveillance systems based on the review. Results The search identified a total of 5936 articles. Removal of duplicates resulted in 5839 articles. After an initial review of the titles, we excluded 4165 articles, with 1674 remaining. Reading of abstracts and keywords eliminated 1549 further records. An in-depth assessment of the remaining 125 articles resulted in a total of 27 articles for inclusion in the review. The result indicated that various clustering and aberration detection algorithms have been empirically implemented or assessed with real data and tested. Based on the findings of the review, we subsequently developed a framework to include data processing, clustering and aberration detection, visualization, and alerts and alarms. Conclusions The review identified various algorithms that have been practically implemented and tested. These results might foster the development of effective and efficient cluster detection mechanisms in empirical syndromic surveillance systems relating to a broad spectrum of space, time, or space-time.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2018,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Pakistan has enormous rising burden of infectious diseases and is further challenged by recent COVID-19. Research trends and performance provide foundation for disease counter measures. However, limited literature from the region has explored the evolutionary process of infectious disease literature. Objective: This bibliometric study aimed to evaluate the credible literature on infectious diseases from Pakistan. Methods: This was a descriptive exploratory study. All types of publications from 2000 to 2020 were extracted from the Web of Science in the subject category of infectious diseases from Pakistan. Later, “RBibliometrix” package was used for detailed analysis using a comprehensive range of indicators. Results: Pakistan was ranked 52nd with 1298 documents from 100 sources, representing 0.38% of global share. Authors were from 117 countries led by USA and UK. Recent decade contributed 84% of documents. Articles (65.1 %) were the most common publication type. Aga Khan University and Hospital were major contributors. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan was the only major funding source from Pakistan. Journal 'International Journal of Infectious Diseases' was the leading and consistent source over time. None of the local journals was found to be a major contributor. Conclusion: Contribution from Pakistan was found to be much lower than its burden of infectious diseases and expected scholarly magnitude. A prioritized response and increased productivity from research community is recommended.

The study presents an overview of the research activity in Big Data Analytics (BDA) in the field of health and demonstrates the existing knowledge through related examples. The objective is to inform health librarians about the nature and magnitude of the technological innovations in health information analysis tools, its influence, and where and how further material could be searched.


METHODS
We performed a bibliometric and co-citation analysis within a total of 804 papers published between 2000 and 2016 and retrieved from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Using the NVivo text analysis software, we identified the stakeholders of BDA in health and innovative decision support systems in the field.


RESULTS
Our findings show a tremendous increase in published papers after 2014. Most of them are relevant to neurology and medical oncology. The stakeholders are clinicians, researchers, patients, administrators, IT specialists, vendors and policymakers. New BDA tools in medicine are mostly developed for disease monitoring purposes while they utilise visualisation to identify disease patterns and statistical analysis of past data for making predictions.

that have dramatically reduced fatalities caused by infectious disease, led to the establishment of Global Immunization Vision and Strategy initiative 
that aims at increasing national vaccination coverage around the world.However, the appearance of emerging infectious disease calls for an establishment of an early warning mechanisms that can predict the next outbreak.Mathematical and statistical model that has been used to predict infectious disease outbreak used single source datasets that is inadequate for public health policymaking.Literatures suggested using big data analytics to get a better and accurate model. Big data deals not only with structured data from 
electronic health records but also integrate unstructured data obtained from social medias and webpages.Thus, this paper aims at identifying the factors frequently used in studies on infectious disease outbreak prediction, focusing specifically on two common disease outbreak in southeast Asia: dengue fever and measles.A systematic literature review approach that search across four databases found 284 literatures, of which 10 literatures were selected in the final process.Based on the review, it seems that studies on measles outbreak employed only single source datasets of patient data retrieved from electronic health records.

Traditionally, tracking hospital outbreaks with drug-resistant pathogens focuses on transmission chains of infected or colonized patients as the reservoir for organisms to be transferred to new patients via healthcare workers, but it has become increasingly recognized that non-patient reservoirs within the hospital may play a larger role than previously realized in acting as a niche for the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens. Non-patient sources for pathogen acquisition may require incorporating environmental culture data into existing transmission models. However, the number of risk factors, potential interactions and inherent complexity of the data continue to increase, and thus, exploratory analysis is required to aid in knowledge discovery. Interactive visualization of these data over space and time enables exploration and hypothesis generation to better inform transmission models. This thesis presents an interactive visualization system for the analysis of spatiotemporal environmental and patient data to aid in understanding nosocomial infection. Interactive dashboards allow users to view patient movement through hospital environments while overlaying multivariate environmental microbiological data as it evolves over time. Furthermore, a multivariate logistic regression model is constructed to understand the factors associated with sink contamination. The results show that temporal factors, including the presence of infected patients in the past 14 days and use of interventions in the past 7 days, and spatial factors, including the presence of infected patients in adjacent rooms and the presence of contaminated sinks in adjacent rooms, are significant factors in sink contamination.",,2016,semantic_scholar,citation,citation
