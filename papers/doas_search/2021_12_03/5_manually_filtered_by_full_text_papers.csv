However, there is a lack of an implemented framework that is technically feasible, easily scalable and that provides meaningful variables to be used in applications for translational medicine. This paper describes the implementation and early evaluation of a physiological sensing tool that collects and processes photoplethysmography data from a wearable smartwatch to calculate heart rate variability in real-time. A technical open-source framework is outlined, involving mobile devices for collection of heart rate data, feature extraction and execution of data mining or machine learning algorithms that ultimately deliver mobile health interventions tailored to the users. Eleven volunteers participated in the empirical evaluation that was carried out using an existing mobile virtual reality application for mental health and under controlled slow-paced breathing exercises. The results validated the feasibility of implementation of the proposed framework in the stages of signal acquisition and real-time calculation of heart rate variability (HRV). The analysis of data regarding packet loss, peak detection and overall system performance provided considerations to enhance the real-time calculation of HRV features. Further studies are planned to validate all the stages of the proposed framework."

Transforming such intentions and interests to reality involves software development and deployment, which has its own story of significant evolution. There has been a notable shift in the strategies and approaches to software development. Today, the divergence of tools and technologies as per demand is so substantial that adapting a software application from one environment to another could involve tedious redesign and redevelopment. This implies enormous effort in migrating existing applications and research works to a modern industrial setup. Additionally, the struggles with sustainability maintenance of such applications could be painful. Concerning ML/AI, the capabilities to train, deploy, retrain, and re-deploy AI models as quickly as possible will be crucial for AI-driven network systems. An end-to-end workflow using unified open-source frameworks is the need of the hour to facilitate the integration of ML/AI models into the modern software-driven virtualized communication networks. Hence, in our paper, we present such a prototype by demonstrating the journey of a sample SVM classifier from being a python script to be deployed as a micro-service using ONAP and Acumos. While illustrating various features of Acumos and ONAP, this paper intends to make readers familiar with an end-to-end workflow taking advantage of the integration of both open-source platforms."

In this context, the use of emergent ICT technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and augmented reality, allows to develop smart and predictive maintenance systems, contributing for the reduction of unplanned machines' downtime by predicting possible failures and recovering faster when they occur. This paper describes the deployment of a smart and predictive maintenance system in an industrial case study, that considers IoT and machine learning technologies to support the online and real-time data collection and analysis for the earlier detection of machine failures, allowing the visualization, monitoring and schedule of maintenance interventions to mitigate the occurrence of such failures. The deployed system also integrates machine learning and augmented reality technologies to support the technicians during the execution of maintenance interventions."

Nowadays, RPA is required to mimic more sophisticated human tasks, thus implying its combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, i.e., the so-called intelligent RPA. Putting together RPA with AI leads to a challenging scenario since (1) it involves professionals from both fields who typically have different skills and backgrounds, and (2) AI models tend to degrade over time which affects the performance of the overall solution. This paper describes the AIRPA project, which addresses these challenges by proposing a software architecture that enables (1) the abstraction of the robot development from the AI development and (2) the monitor, control, and maintain intelligent RPA developments to ensure its quality and performance over time. The project has been conducted in the Servinform context, a Spanish consultancy firm, and the proposed prototype has been validated with reality settings. The initial experiences yield promising results in reducing AHT (Average Handle Time) in processes where AIRPA deployed cognitive robots, which encourages exploring the support of intelligent RPA development."

However, although these processes are sufficient for theoretical experiments, they often fail when they meet the reality of city data and processes, which by their very nature are highly distributed, heterogeneous, and exhibit high degrees of spatial and temporal variance. In order to address those problems, we have designed and implemented an integrated development environment called CityFlow that supports developing machine learning applications. With CityFlow, we can develop, deploy, and maintain machine learning applications easily by using an intuitive data flow model. To verify our approach, we conducted two case studies: deploying a road damage detection application to help monitor transport infrastructure and an automatic labeling application in support of a participatory sensing application. These applications show both the generic applicability of our approach, and its ease of use; both critical if we wish to deploy sophisticated ML based applications to smart cities."

However, implementation of active training is still difficult as it's challenging to detect human motion intention online and impose corresponding robot control. This paper introduces a novel upper-limb rehabilitation robot, and proposes a sEMG-driven (sEMG: surface Electromyography) torque estimation model based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The robot has three DOFs, of which the first two DOFs adopt a planar parallel structure, and the wrist module has an exoskeleton form. In this study, we design an impedance controller and an admittance controller for the first two DOFs and the wrist module, respectively. Specifically, for the first two DOFs, the assistance/resistance force at the end-effector was controlled according to its motions and desired interaction impedance; for the wrist module, an sEMG armband was used to collect 8 channels of sEMG signals from the forearm muscles, and a time-delay ANN model was developed to estimate the wrist pronation/supination torque, based on which the wrist rotation was controlled according to the human motion intention. To overcome the overfitting problem, besides the experimental samples of wrist rotation, both resting and co-contraction samples were collected for training. Finally, combining with the design of a virtual reality game and force fields, the proposed methods were implemented and tested experimentally on the upper-limb rehabilitation robot."

In particular, we propose a compensation method of two-stage image generation neural network for generating fashion design with progressive users' inputs. Our work is based on a recent proposed deep learning model, pix2pix, that can successfully transform an image from one domain into another domain, such as from line drawings to color images. However, the pix2pix model relies on the condition that input images should come from the same distribution, which is usually hard for applying it to real human computer interaction tasks, where the input from users differs from individual to individual. To address the problem, we propose a compensation method of two-stage image generation. In the first stage, we ask users to indicate their design preference with an easy task, such as tuning clothing landmarks, and use the input to generate a compensation input. With the compensation input, in the second stage, we then concatenate it with the real sketch from users to generate a perceptual better result. In addition, to deploy the two-stage image generation neural network in augmented reality environment, we designed and implemented a mobile application where users can create fashion design referring to real world human models. With the augmented 2D screen and instant feedback from our system, users can design clothing by seamlessly mixing the real and virtual environment. Through an online experiment with 46 participants and an offline use case study, we showcase the capability and usability of our system. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our system and further works on human-AI collaborated design."

Maintaining situational awareness (i.e., knowledge of current conditions and activities at the scene) is critical to the accurate decision-making necessary for the safe and successful navigation of a fire environment by firefighters. Conversely, the disorientation caused by hazards such as smoke and extreme heat can lead to injury or even fatality. This research implements recent advancements in technology such as deep learning, point cloud and thermal imaging, and augmented reality platforms to improve a firefighter's situational awareness and scene navigation through improved interpretation of that scene. We have designed and built a prototype embedded system that can leverage data streamed from cameras built into a firefighter's personal protective equipment (PPE) to capture thermal, RGB color, and depth imagery and then deploy already developed deep learning models to analyze the input data in real time. The embedded system analyzes and returns the processed images via wireless streaming, where they can be viewed remotely and relayed back to the firefighter using an augmented reality platform that visualizes the results of the analyzed inputs and draws the firefighter's attention to objects of interest, such as doors and windows otherwise invisible through smoke and flames."

The technology's brain child is DARPA's autonomous urban challenge from over a decade ago. Few companies have had some success in applying algorithms to commercial cars. These algorithms range from classical control approaches to Deep Learning. In this paper, we will use Deep Learning techniques and the Tensor flow framework with the goal of navigating a driverless car through an urban environment. The novelty in this system is the use of Deep Learning vs. traditional methods of real-time autonomous operation as well as the application of the Tensorflow framework itself.

Hence, building resilient CPSs is a prime need and continuous monitoring of the CPS operational health is essential for improving resilience. This paper presents a framework for calculating and monitoring of health in CPSs using data driven techniques. The main advantages of this data driven methodology is that the ability of leveraging heterogeneous data streams that are available from the CPSs and the ability of performing the monitoring with minimal a priori domain knowledge. The main objective of the framework is to warn the operators of any degradation in cyber, physical or overall health of the CPS. The framework consists of four components: 1) Data acquisition and feature extraction, 2) state identification and real time state estimation, 3) cyber-physical health calculation and 4) operator warning generation. Further, this paper presents an initial implementation of the first three phases of the framework on a CPS testbed involving a Microgrid simulation and a cyber-network which connects the grid with its controller. The feature extraction method and the use of unsupervised learning algorithms are discussed. Experimental results are presented for the first two phases and the results showed that the data reflected different operating states and visualization techniques can be used to extract the relationships in data features."

Therefore, this study investigates the interaction between software engineering and machine learning within the context of health systems.

With the rise of artificial intelligence deep learning in recent years, various analytical software resources have gradually become easier to obtain. At the same time, wearable cyber physical sensors are becoming more and more popular. Measurements on vital signs such as heartbeat, electrocardiogram, and blood oxygenation blood pressure values are ubiquitous. We propose an integrated system that combines dialysis big data deep learning analysis with cross platform physiological sensing. We specifically tackle the early warning of dialysis discomfort such as hypotension, hypertension, cramps, etc., this requires a large amount of data collection, related training, data sources including dialysis treatment process and home physiological data. Although the Dialysis machine is able to produce huge amount of IoT data, the usable data for early warning system training is not as huge due to the limited physician labors devoted for labeling questionable samples. This generally leads to low accuracy for regular CNN training methods. We enhance the AI training performance via a transfer learning technique. The AI training accuracy reaches the value of 99% with the help of transfer learning, while that of an original CNN process on the HD data bears a low 60% accuracy. Given the high prediction accuracy of our AI engine, we are able to integrate the real time measurements from Dialysis machine with wearable devices such as ECG sensors and wrist health watches, and make precision prediction of incoming discomfort during the HD treatments. The ECG signal of the same group patients are also analyzed with the same technique. The same accuracy enhancement are also observed."

Recently, the AAL IoT ecosystem has been enriched with promising technologies such as edge computing, which has demonstrated to be the best approach to overcome the demanding requirements of AAL and healthcare services by providing a reduction of the amount of data to transfer to the cloud, an improvement of the response time, and quality of experience. Also, the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies at the edge provides intelligence to improve the decision making timely. However, this approach has been scarcely studied in AAL scenarios and the few proposals based on deploying machine learning models at the edge lack efficiency, security, mechanisms of resource management, service management, and deployment, as well as a real and experimental AAL scenario. For these reasons, this paper proposes an innovative edge gateway architecture to support the deployment of deep learning (DL) models in AAL and healthcare scenarios efficiently. To do so, we have added a predictive analytics module to deploy the models. Since AI technologies demand more resources, a container-based virtualization technology is employed on the edge gateway to manage the limited resources, and provide security and lifecycle services management.

In this work, a data driven controller is developed to control force and pose of a soft contact ultrasound sensor. The adaptive controller is based on a fuzzy-rules emulated network structure with the learning algorithm using a stochastic gradient approximation.

As an example, a hospital service robot is told to deliver medicine to Patient Two in Ward Three. Without awareness of what “Patient Two” or “Ward Three” is, a service robot must systematically explore the environment to perform this task, which requires a long time. The implementation of a Semantic Map allows for robots to perceive the environment similar to people by associating semantic information with spatial information found in geometric maps. Currently, many semantic mapping works provide insufficient or incorrect semantic-metric information to allow a service robot to function dynamically in human-centric environments. This paper proposes a semantic map with a hierarchical semantic organization structure based on a hybrid metric-topological map leveraging convolutional neural networks and spatial room segmentation methods.

The ePHoRt is a Web-based platform for the remote home monitoring rehabilitation exercises in patients after hip replacement surgery. It involves a learning phase and a serious game scheme for the execution and evaluation of the exercises as part of a therapeutic program. Modular software architecture is proposed, under the patient perspective, to be used as a reference model for researchers or professionals who wish to carry out tele-rehabilitation platforms, and to guarantee security, flexibility, and scalability. The architecture incorporates two main components. The first one manages the patient' therapeutic programs taking into account two principles: 1) maintain loose coupling between the layers of the framework and 2) Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The second one evaluates the performed exercises in real time considering an independent acquisition mechanism for the patient movements and two artificial algorithms. The first algorithm allows evaluating the quality of the movements, while the second one allows assessing the levels of pain intensity by recognizing the patient' emotions when performing the movements. Details of the components and the meta-model of the architecture are presented and discussed considering their advantages and disadvantages."

Although running such workflows in clouds promises reduced operational costs, there are still numerous scheduling challenges to overcome. Such complex workflows are dynamic, exhibit periodic patterns, and combine diverse task groupings and requirements. In this work, we propose ANANKE, a scheduling system addressing these challenges. Our approach extends the state-of-the-art in portfolio scheduling for data centers with a reinforcement-learning technique, and proposes various scheduling policies for managing complex workflows. Portfolio scheduling addresses the dynamic aspect of the workload. Q-learning, allows our approach to adapt to the periodic patterns of the workload, and to tune the other configuration parameters. The proposed policies are heuristics that guide the provisioning process, and map workflow tasks to the provisioned cloud resources. Through real-world experiments based on real and synthetic industrial workloads, we analyze and compare our prototype implementation of ANANKE with a system without portfolio scheduling (baseline) and with a system equipped with a standard portfolio scheduler. Overall, our experimental results give evidence that a learning-based portfolio scheduler can perform better and consume fewer resources than state-of-the-art alternatives, in particular for workloads with uniform arrival patterns."

The work introduced in the paper provides an interface in mobile platform, which enables the user to input histopathology image and obtain the prediction results with its class probability through embedded web-server. The trained deep convolutional neural networks model is deployed into a microcomputer-based embedded system after hyper-parameter tuning, offering congruent performance. The implementation results show that the embedded platform with custom-trained CNN model is suitable for medical image classification, as it takes less execution time and mean prediction time. It is also noticed that customized CNN classifier model outperforms pre-trained models when used in embedded platforms for prediction and classification of histopathology images.

At the same time, many challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends by making use of continuous crowdsourced labeling of public social media content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow from data collection, filtering, labeling and training of machine learning classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the public health domain.

In addition, to satisfy both functional and nonfunctional requirements such as reliability and energy efficiency, robotic SW applications have to be properly developed to take advantage of heterogeneous (Edge-Fog-Cloud) architectures. In this context, containerization and orchestration are becoming a standard practice as they allow for better information flow among different network levels as well as increased modularity in the use of software components.

Such operations can be carried out by industrial robots in multiple ways because an industrial robot is typically functionally redundant with respect to a finishing task. In the proposed system, a human expert demonstrates a finishing operation, and the demonstrated motion is recorded in the Cartesian space. The robot’s kinematic model is augmented with a virtual mechanism, which is defined according to the applied finishing tool. This way, the kinematic model is expanded with additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to compute the optimal joint space motion of the robot without altering the essential aspects of the Cartesian space task execution as demonstrated by the human expert. Finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, occur in contact with the treated workpiece. Since information about the contact point position is needed to control the robot during the operation, we have developed a novel approach for accurate estimation of contact points using the measured forces and torques. Finally, we applied iterative learning control to refine the demonstrated operations and compensate for inaccurate calibration and different dynamics of the robot and human demonstrator. The proposed method was verified on real robots and real polishing and grinding tasks. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>—This work was motivated by the need for automation of finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, on contemporary industrial robots. Existing approaches are both too complex and too time-consuming to be applied in flexible and small-scale production, which often requires the frequent deployment of new applications. Our approach is based on programming by demonstration and enables the programming of finishing operations also for users who are not specialists in robot programming. Programming by demonstration is especially useful for teaching finishing operations because it enables the transfer of expert knowledge about finishing skills to robots without providing lengthy task descriptions or manual coding. Besides the human demonstration of the desired operation, the proposed approach also requires the availability of the kinematic model for the machine tool applied to carry out the finishing operation. We provide several practical examples of grinding and polishing tools and how to integrate them into our approach. Another feature of the proposed system is that user demonstrations of finishing operations can be transferred between different combinations of robots and machine tools."

The commonly used manual methods suffer from inefficiency, excessive space consumption, and beverage wastes after filling. To replace the manual operations in the pre-filling detection with improved efficiency and reduced costs, this paper proposes a machine learning based Acoustic Defect Detection (LearningADD) system. Moreover, to realize scalable deployment on edge and cloud computing platforms, deployment strategies especially partitioning and allocation of functionalities need to be compared and optimized under realistic constraints such as latency, complexity, and capacity of the platforms. In particular, to distinguish the defects in glass bottles efficiently, the improved Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is employed to extend the extracted feature sets, and then Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) based feature selection is applied to optimize the feature sets. Five deployment strategies are quantitatively compared to optimize real-time performances based on the constraints measured from a real edge and cloud environment. The LearningADD algorithms are validated by the datasets from a real-life beverage factory, and the F-measure of the system reaches 98.48 %. The proposed deployment strategies are verified by experiments on private cloud platforms, which shows that the Distributed Heavy Edge deployment outperforms other strategies, benefited from the parallel computing and edge computing, where the Defect Detection Time for one bottle is less than 2.061 s in 99 % probability."

However, the volume of data in a hyperspectral image is large (order of Gigabytes) and standard off-the-shelf algorithms for multi-channel image analysis cannot be readily applied, due to the prohibitive computational time and large memory requirements. Therefore, new scalable approaches are required to perform hyperspectral image analysis. In this article we address an efficient methodology for conducting Unsupervised Image Segmentation – one of the basic and most fundamental image analysis operations. In the methodology proposed, unsupervised segmentation is conducted after transforming the spectral and spatial dimensions of the raw hyperspectral image into a more compact representation using multivariate and multiresolution techniques. The clusters identified in the compact image representation are then used to train a discriminative classifier. The classifier is then adapted and transferred for application to the raw image, where it will efficiently label all the original pixels. With the proposed methodology, the computational expensive operations (unsupervised clustering and classifier learning) are minimized, whereas the efficient implementation of the classifier guarantees the analysis at the native resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was tested on a real case study considering an industrial hyperspectral image capturing the reflectance spectrum for several objects made of different unknown materials. A significant reduction in the computational cost was achieved without compromising the quality of the unsupervised segmentation, demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach."

Renewables have been developed fast, however, the intermittent nature has imposed higher requirement for the flexibility of the power grid. Retrofitting carbon capture technologies to existing fossil-fuel fired power plants is an important solution to avoid the “lock-in” of emissions, but the high operating costs hinders their large scale application. The coexistence of renewable power and carbon capture opens up a new avenue that the deployment of carbon capture can provide additional flexibility for better accommodation of renewable power while excess renewables can be used to reduce the operating costs of carbon capture. To this end, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence based optimal scheduling strategy for the power plant-carbon capture system in the context of renewable power penetration to show that the mutual benefits between carbon capture and renewable power can be achieved when the carbon capture process is made fully adjustable. An artificial intelligent deep belief neural network is used to reflect the complex interactions between carbon, heat and electricity within the power plant carbon capture system. Multiple operating goals are considered in the scheduling such as minimizing the operating costs, renewable power curtailment and carbon emission, and the particle swarm heuristic optimization is employed to find the optimal solution. The impacts of carbon capture constraint mode, carbon emission penalty coefficient, carbon dioxide production constraints and renewable power installed capacity are investigated to provide broader insight on the potential benefit of carbon capture in future low-carbon energy system. A case study using real world data of weather condition and load demand shows that renewable power curtailment can be reduced by 51% with the integration of post-combustion capture systems and 35% of total carbon emission are captured by the use of excess renewable power through optimal scheduling. This paper points out a new way of using artificial intelligent technologies to coordinate the couplings between carbon and electricity for efficient and environmentally friendly operation of future low-carbon energy system."

The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud."

Based on the data collected from the interest areas, SIGI software has the ability to show real-time situational analysis of these areas and allows that the administrator can optimize resources (material and human) improving the efficiency of resource allocation in these areas. In addition to the development of the management software, the development of sensors to collect the information in the field and update these information to the database of the management software, are considered. The sensors will be recognized as IoT devices for the collection of meteorological data, images and command / control Drones. Initially the system will be customized, using an Artificial Intelligence tool, to collect data and identify the outbreaks of the dengue mosquito, zika and Chikungunya, nominee by risk areas. After the definition of the potential risk areas, in a complementary way, a totally customized Drone will be used to map these areas of interest, generating aerial photographs, identifying and geotagging the potential “targets”, which will allow the agents to identify potential mosquito breeding sites. After the identification of breeding areas, the next step will be the effective combat of the vectors, using the Drones to fly over the areas of interest, where biological defenses will be “dropped” over the targets to combat mosquitoes. Due some Drone flight restrictions over the cities, the whole process will be monitored by a situation room, that will be able to control the Drone remotely, access the air space controller, reads the sensors installed in the city (field), that will measure, for example, rainfall through weather stations installed in risk areas and subsequently processed by Intelligent System Integrated Management (SIGI), which will result to the information public official reflecting the situational analysis of the areas, which will enable a better management of available resources, helping the public agent, preventively in the decision making."

In the connected mobility world, emotion recognition from facial expressions is a possibility, however a faster processing and edge computing device to derive anomaly state inferences will be apt for further notifying about the safety of the passenger. FPGA implementation is a viable approach to not only implement in the embedded system automotive electronics, but also accelerate the inference results, hence making it as an ideal real time candidate for passenger anomaly state identification. For the same, a real time emotion detection system using facial features was implemented on FPGA. A Binary Neural Network (BNN) feeded by Local Binary Pattern (LBP) output was designed towards the development of an improved and faster emotion recognition system. LBP is configured as a preprocessing step to extract facial features that is passed on to the BNN layer for successful inference. The preprocessing method utilizes Viola-Jones (VJ) algorithm to extract facial data while removing other background information from the image. The LBP-BNN network is modelled using Facial Expression 2013 (FER-2013) data set for training. The custom hardware accelerator or the overlay is synthesized and the designed IP is implemented on FPGA for the inference. Inference is done using the trained model on FPGA to enable faster classified results. Emotion detection using facial expressions is classified to six states namely: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, and surprise. The LBP-BNN network is implemented in FPGA, to realize a real time facial emotion recognition by capturing the image of a person from a web camera interfaced to the FPGA acting as edge computing inference device, with acceptable accuracy. The image processing based emotion detection design is highly suitable for other applications including tracking of emotions for movement disorder patients in hospitals."

Such data streams can be later utilized by machine learning algorithms and decision support systems to predict critical clinical states and motivate users to adopt behaviours that improve the quality of their life and the society as a whole. However, in many cases, even when deployed over highly sophisticated, cutting-edge network infrastructure and deployment paradigms, data may exhibit missing values and non-uniformities due to various reasons, including device malfunction, deliberate data reduction for efficient processing, or data loss due to sensing and communication failures. This work proposes a novel approach to deal with missing entries in heart rate measurements. Benefiting from the low-rank property of the generated data matrices and the proximity of neighbouring measurements, we provide a novel method that combines classical matrix completion approaches with weighted Laplacian interpolation offering high reconstruction accuracy at fast execution times. Extensive evaluation studies carried out with real measurements show that the proposed methods could be effectively deployed by modern wristband-cloud computing systems increasing the robustness, the reliability and the energy efficiency of these systems."

E-Water aims at providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mékrou river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland.
                  In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization.
                  To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and hypothetical scenarios in the Mékrou river basin. The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income.
                  The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic management strategies for nutrients and water. Such practices would augment crop productivity, which, in turn, would allow to cope with increasing future food demands, and find a balanced use of natural resources, also taking other economic sectors—like livestock, urban or energy—into account."

Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities such as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity operations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an effective system for model development that streamlines data curation, training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges. The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a cloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset, to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses (positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code. Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality. Remote development, scalable compute, and automatic organization of data and artifacts have dramatically decreased iteration time while increasing reproducibility and system comprehension. Diverse, high-fidelity synthetic images that more closely replicate the real environment have improved model performance against real-world data. These results demonstrate that the presented pipeline offers tangible benefits to the application of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations."

AI-assisted video analytics can provide valuable information and benefits for parties in various domains. Face recognition, object detection, or movement tracing are prominent examples enabled by this technology. However, the widespread deployment of such mechanism in public areas are a growing cause of privacy and security concerns. Data protection strategies need to be appropriately designed and correctly implemented in order to mitigate the associated risks. Most existing approaches focus on privacy and security related operations of the video stream itself or protecting its transmission. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving system for AI-assisted video analytics, that extracts relevant information from video data and governs the secure access to that information. The system ensures that applications leveraging extracted data have no access to the video stream. An attribute-based authorization scheme allows applications to only query a predefined subset of extracted data. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating an application motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, deployed on typical edge computing infrastructure."

However, the Internet can only provide no guaranteed delivery. The high dynamic of the available bandwidth may cause bitrate switching or video rebuffering, thus inevitably damaging the QoE. Besides, the frequently requested popular videos are transmitted for multiple times and contribute to most of the bandwidth consumption, which causes massive transmission redundancy. Therefore, we propose a Learning-based Edge with cAching and Prefetching (LEAP) to improve the online user QoE of adaptive video streaming. LEAP introduces caching into the edge to reduce the redundant video transmission and employs prefetching to fight against network jitters. Taking the state information of users into account, LEAP intelligently makes the most beneficial decisions of caching and prefetching by a QoE-oriented deep neural network model. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we deploy the implemented prototype of LEAP in both the simulated scenario and the real Internet. Compared with all selected schemes, LEAP at least raises average bitrate by 34.4% and reduces video rebuffering by 42.7%, which leads to at least 15.9% improvement in the user QoE in the simulated scenario. The results in the real Internet scenario further confirm the superiority of LEAP."

As a result, they can hardly achieve satisfactory results in our drone cinematography task. In this study, we propose a learning-based framework which incorporates the video contents and previous camera motions to predict the future camera motions that enable the capture of professional videos. Specifically, the inputs of our framework are video contents which are represented using subject-related feature based on 2D skeleton and scene-related features extracted from background RGB images, and camera motions which are represented using optical flows. The correlation between the inputs and output future camera motions are learned via a sequence-to-sequence convolutional long short-term memory (Seq2Seq ConvLSTM) network from a large set of video clips. We deploy our approach to a real drone cinematography system by first predicting the future camera motions, and then converting them to the drone's control commands via an odometer.

With ABR, each video content is transcoded into multiple representations in different bitrates and resolutions. However, video transcoding is computing intensive, which requires the transcoding service providers to deploy a large number of servers for transcoding the video contents published by the content producers. As such, a natural question for the transcoding service provider is how to provision the computing resource for transcoding the video contents while maximizing service profit. To address this problem, we design a cloud video transcoding system by taking the advantage of cloud computing technology to elastically allocate computing resource. We propose a method for jointly considering the task scheduling and resource provisioning problem in two timescales, and formulate the service profit maximization as a two-timescale stochastic optimization problem. We derive some approximate policies for the task scheduling and resource provisioning. Based on our proposed methods, we implement our open source cloud video transcoding system Morph and evaluate its performance in a real environment. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can reduce the resource consumption and achieve a higher profit compared with the baseline schemes."

One such application area is the adoption of Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) by law enforcement officials. The need to be ‘always-on’ puts heavy constraints on battery usage in these camera front-ends, thus limiting their widespread adoption. Further, the increasing number of such cameras is expected to create a data deluge, which requires large processing, transmission and storage capabilities. Instead of continuously capturing and streaming or storing videos, it is prudent to provide “smartness” to the camera front-end. This requires hardware assisted image recognition and template matching in the front-end, capable of making judicious decisions on when to trigger video capture or streaming. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) based neural networks have been shown to provide high accuracy for image recognition and are well suited for low power and re-configurable systems. In this paper we propose an RBM based “always-on’’ camera front-end capable of detecting human posture.

The proposed system has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 7 XC7VX485T platform. A minimum dynamic power of 19.18 mW for a target recognition accuracy while maintaining real time constraints has been measured. The hardware-software co-design illustrates the trade-offs in the design with respect to accuracy, resource utilization, processing time and power. The results demonstrate the possibility of a true “always-on” body-worn camera system in the IoT environment."

Though end-to-end encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL) fulfils this requirement, it makes inspecting network traffic with legacy solutions such as Deep Packet Inspection difficult. Recent Machine Learning techniques have shown outstanding performance in encrypted traffic classification. Nevertheless, such approaches require efficient flow sampling at real enterprise-scale networks due to the sheer volume of transferred data. Through this paper, we propose a holistic architecture to extract flow information of encrypted data at multi Gbps line rate using sampling and sketching mechanisms, enabling network operators to estimate flow size distribution accurately and understand the behavior of VPN-obfuscated traffic. Using over 6000 video traffic traces, under three main evaluation scenarios based on trace duration and starting time point, we show that it is possible to achieve 99% accuracy for service provider classification and over 90% accuracy for content classification for a given service provider in the best case. We also deploy our solution at an operational enterprise-scale network leveraging kernel bypassing to demonstrate its capability to efficiently sample live traffic for analytics."

The real time implementation of the algorithm with adequate accuracy is required, with hardware timing into consideration. This paper deals with the implementation of machine learning algorithm for real time facial image recognition. Two dominant methods out of many facial recognition methods are discussed, simulated and implemented using Raspberry Pi. A rigorous comparative analysis is presented considering various limitations which may be the case required for innumerable application which utilize facial recognition. The drawbacks and different use cases of each method is highlighted. The facial recognition software uses algorithms to compare a digital image captured through a camera, to the stored face print so as to authenticate a person's identity. The Haar-Cascade method was one of the first methods developed for facial recognition. The HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) method has worked very effectively for object recognition and thus suitable for facial recognition also. Both the methods are compared with Eigen feature-based face recognition algorithm. Various important features are experimented like speed of operation, lighting condition, frontal face profile, side profiles, distance of image, size of image etc. The facial recognition model is implemented to detect and recognize faces in real-time by means of Raspberry Pi and Pi camera for the user defined database in addition to the available databases."

This paper describes the design and implementation of an Intelligent Travel Aid for the Visually Impaired, it combines the detection and recognition of objects in real-time with audio feedback to provide aid to the visually impaired users. This assistive device uses machine vision for object recognition detection, a camera for capturing object images respectively and a speaker all collectively form the core of the system. The system notifies users of obstacles and objects via synthesized speech. Using a quantized MobileNet based Single Shot multibox object detection model pre-trained on the Common Objects in Context dataset, the device was able to detect objects/obstacles, as well as determine the relative position and approximate distance. The device, when tested, was found to achieve real time performance of up to 70.56 frames per second for detections. Audio feedback was also achieved using the eSpeak Text to Speech engine to provide real time voice instructions to the user. All algorithms were implemented using Python language.

In this paper, we propose a framework, which can imitate a filming style by
""seeing"" only a single demonstration video of the same style, i.e., one-shot
imitation filming. This is done by two key enabling techniques: 1) feature
extraction of the filming style from the demo video, and 2) filming style
transfer from the demo video to the new situation. We implement the approach
with deep neural network and deploy it to a 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) real
drone cinematography system by first predicting the future camera motions, and
then converting them to the drone's control commands via an odometer. Our
experimental results on extensive datasets and showcases exhibit significant
improvements in our approach over conventional baselines and our approach can
successfully mimic the footage with an unseen style."

question: how many researchers will effectively benefit from these advances? In
this work, we detail how to transfer the knowledge acquired in simulation into
the real world. To that end, we describe the architectural discrepancies that
damage the Sim2Real adaptation ability of models trained on the Habitat

real-world scenarios. We then deploy our models on a LoCoBot, a Low-Cost Robot
equipped with a single Intel RealSense camera. Different from previous work,
our testing scene is unavailable to the agent in simulation. The environment is
also inaccessible to the agent beforehand, so it cannot count on scene-specific
semantic priors. In this way, we reproduce a setting in which a research group
(potentially from other fields) needs to employ the agent visual navigation

traditional methods. The performance of the deep learning methods are largely
dependent on the data distribution they were trained on, and it is important to
use data from the robot's actual operating domain during training. Therefore,
it is not possible to rely on pre-built, generic datasets when deploying robots
in real environments, creating a need for efficient data collection and
annotation in the specific operating conditions the robots will operate in. The
challenge is then: how do we reduce the cost of obtaining such datasets to a
point where we can easily deploy our robots in new conditions, environments and
to support new sensors? As an answer to this question, we propose a data
annotation pipeline based on SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and 3D-to-2D geometry.
The pipeline allows creating 3D and 2D bounding boxes, along with per-pixel
annotations of arbitrary objects without needing accurate 3D models of the
objects prior to data collection and annotation. Our results showcase almost

Social users are surrounded by a huge volume of malicious links, biased comments, fake reviews, or fraudulent advertisements, etc. Traditional spam detection approaches propose a variety of statistical feature-based models to filter out social spam from a historical dataset. However, they omit the real word situation of social data, that is, social spam is fast changing with new topics or events. Therefore, traditional approaches cannot effectively achieve online detection of the ""drifting"" social spam with a fixed statistic feature set. In this paper, we present Sifter, a system which can detect online social spam in a scalable manner without the labor-intensive feature engineering. The Sifter system is two-fold: (1) a decentralized DHT-based overlay deployment for harnessing the group characteristics of social spam activities within a specific topic/event; (2) a social spam processing with the support of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to get rid of the traditional manual feature engineering. Results show that Sifter achieves graceful spam detection performances with the minimal size of data and good balance in group management."

The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains.

This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures.

The results demonstrate this integrated approach can implement experiments and data analysis automatically to provide specific bioprocess design solutions in a closed loop strategy at first time.

The knowledge of what is in front of the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or planning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class label and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to the robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for addressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the integration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often difficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several high-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and training. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this fragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the semantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the training of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and the intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real robotic platform. Thus, we do not propose a new CNN approach in this paper. Instead, we provide a stable and easy-to-use tool to make this technology more approachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at closing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics research. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment.

SEAL is a research project aimed at developing Home Automation (HA) solutions for building energy management, user customization and improved safety of its inhabitants. One of the main problems of HA systems is the wide range of communication standards that commercial devices use. Usually this forces the designer to choose devices from a few brands, limiting the scope of the system and its capabilities. In this context, SmartSEAL is a framework that aims to integrate heterogeneous devices, such as sensors and actuators from different vendors, providing networking features, protocols and interfaces that are easy to implement and dynamically configurable.

However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-learning to learn the shortest path on the building model’s graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actor–critic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces. Hence, our model achieves near optimal performance on the real world emergency environment."

Embodied Evolution (EE) is an evolutionary paradigm that aims to address this problem through the embodiment of the individuals that make up the population in the physical robots. The interest for this type of evolutionary approach has been increasing steadily, leading to different algorithms and variations adapted to solve very specific practical cases. In a previous work, the authors started the implementation of a standard canonical EE algorithm that captures the more general principles of this paradigm and that can be applied to any distributed optimization problem. This canonical algorithm has been characterized already over a set of theoretical fitness landscapes corresponding to representative examples of the basic casuistry found in collective tasks. The current paper goes one step ahead in this research line, and the canonical algorithm is applied here in a collective navigation task in which a fleet of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has to gather red rocks in an indoor scenario. The objective is to confirm that the characterization conclusions are generalizable to a practical case and to show that the canonical algorithm can be configured to operate as a specific algorithm easily."

For this quality they are being used in varying circumstances which humans cannot control. Rovers are special robots, capable of traversing through areas that are too difficult for humans. Even though it is a robust bot, lack of proper intelligence and automation are its basic shortcomings. As the main purpose of a rover is to traverse through areas of extreme difficulties, therefore an intelligent path generation and following system is highly required. Our research work aimed at developing an algorithm for autonomous path generation using GPS (Global Positioning System) based coordinate system and implementation of this algorithm in real life terrain, which in our case is MDRS, Utah, USA. Our prime focus was the development of a robust but easy to implement system. After developing such system, we have been able to successfully traverse our rover through that difficult terrain. It uses GPS coordinates of target points that will be fed into the rover from a control station. The rover capturing its own GPS signal generates a path between the current location and the destination location on its own. It then finds the deviation in its current course of direction and position. And eventually it uses Proportional Integral Derivative control loop feedback mechanism (PID control algorithm) for compensating the error or deviation and thus following that path and reach destination. A low cost on board computer (Raspberry Pi in our case) handles all the calculations during the process and drives the rover fulfilling its task using an microcontroller (Arduino)."

Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm based on bionic swarm intelligence was used. A hybrid intelligent algorithm combined Monte Carlo simulation and neural network is used for solving stochastic chance constrained models of MRTA. A practical implementation with real WSN and real mobile robots were carried out. In environment the successful implementation of tasks without collision validates the efficiency, stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The convergence curve shows that as iterative generation grows, the utility increases and finally reaches a stable and optimal value. Results show that using sensor information fusion can greatly improve the efficiency. The algorithm is proved better than tradition algorithms without WSN for MRTA in real time."

Gaussian processes constitute an interesting underlying data model that leverages the spatial correlations of the process to be explored to reduce the required sampling of data. Furthermore, multi-agent approaches offer well known advantages for exploration. Previous decentralized multi-agent exploration algorithms that use Gaussian processes as underlying data model, have only been validated through simulations. However, the implementation of an exploration algorithm brings difficulties that were not tackle yet. In this work, we propose an exploration algorithm that deals with the following challenges: (i) which information to transmit to achieve multi-agent coordination; (ii) how to implement a light-weight collision avoidance; (iii) how to learn the data's model without prior information. We validate our algorithm with two experiments employing real robots. First, we explore the magnetic field intensity with a ground-based robot.

This approach relies on using several matrices to associate each new input value with previous robot states. An example is provided and analyzed which shows a successful simulated implementation of this approach. In addition a real world test of the approach was conducted which demonstrates that the implementation not only generates new paths, but does so fast enough to be feasible for real time systems"

In this work, we describe the RoboEarth semantic mapping system. The semantic map is composed of: 1) an ontology to code the concepts and relations in maps and objects and 2) a SLAM map providing the scene geometry and the object locations with respect to the robot. We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using RoboEarth cloud services, a simple robot can reliably and efficiently build the semantic maps needed to perform its quotidian tasks. In addition, we show the synergetic relation of the SLAM map of objects that grounds the terminological knowledge coded in the ontology."

Its first tasks is to take water probes, analyze them onboard, and measure positions of manholes and pipes to detect pollution loaded sewage and to improve current maps of sewer systems. One of the challenging problems is the control software, which should enable the robot to navigate in the sewer system and perform the inspection tasks autonomously, while always taking care of its own safety. Tests in our test environment and in a real sewer system show promising results. This paper focuses on the software approach. To manage the complexity a layered architecture has been chosen, each layer defining a different level of abstraction. After determining the abstraction levels, we use different methods for implementation. For the highest abstraction level a standard AI-planning algorithm is used.

In real-world applications, the need for a robot to interact in real time with multiple humans in a dynamic, 3-D environment presents a significant challenge. The recent availability of commercial color-depth cameras allow for the creation of a system that makes use of the depth dimension, thus enabling a robot to observe its environment and perceive in the 3-D space. Here we present a system for 3-D multiple human perception in real time from a moving robot equipped with a color-depth camera and a consumer-grade computer. Our approach reduces computation time to achieve real-time performance through a unique combination of new ideas and established techniques. We remove the ground and ceiling planes from the 3-D point cloud input to separate candidate point clusters. We introduce the novel information concept, depth of interest, which we use to identify candidates for detection, and that avoids the computationally expensive scanning-window methods of other approaches. We utilize a cascade of detectors to distinguish humans from objects, in which we make intelligent reuse of intermediary features in successive detectors to improve computation. Because of the high computational cost of some methods, we represent our candidate tracking algorithm with a decision directed acyclic graph, which allows us to use the most computationally intense techniques only where necessary. We detail the successful implementation of our novel approach on a mobile robot and examine its performance in scenarios with real-world challenges, including occlusion, robot motion, nonupright humans, humans leaving and reentering the field of view (i.e., the reidentification challenge), human-object and human-human interaction.

Despite promising results, training agents using images is hardware intensive often requiring millions of training steps to converge incurring long training times and increased risk of wear and tear on the robot. To speed up training, images are often cropped and downscaled resulting in a smaller field of view and loss of valuable high-frequency data. In this paper, we propose training the vision system using supervised learning prior to training robotic actuation using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The vision system uses a software retina, based on the mammalian retino-cortical transform, to preprocess full-size images to compress image data while preserving the full field of view and high-frequency visual information around the fixation point prior to processing by a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to extract visual state information. Using the vision system to preprocess the environment improves the agent's sample complexity and network update speed leading to significantly faster training with reduced image data loss. Our method is used to train a DRL system to control a real Baxter robot's arm, processing full-size images captured by an in-wrist camera to locate an object on a table and centre the camera over it by actuating the robot arm."

For every new deployment, the high level policy is trained on an easily obtainable scan of the environment modeling its visuals and layout. We detail the design of such an environment and how one can use it for training a final navigation policy. Further, we demonstrate a learned low-level policy.

We evaluate the method by performing domain adaptation in simulation and analyzing the structure of the latent space during adaptation. We then deploy this policy on a KUKA LBR 4+ robot and evaluate its performance on a task of hitting a hockey puck to a target. Our method shows more consistent and stable domain adaptation than the baseline, resulting in better overall performance."

There are several balancing algorithms for bipedal robots in the literature, however most of them either rely on hard coding or power-hungry algorithms. We propose a hybrid autonomous controller that hierarchically combines two separate, efficient systems, to address this problem. The lower-level system is a reliable, high-speed, full state controller that was hardcoded on a microcontroller to be power efficient. The higher-level system is a low-speed reinforcement learning controller implemented on a low-power onboard computer. While one controller offers speed, the other provides trainability and adaptability. An efficient control is then formed without sacrificing adaptability to new dynamic environments. Additionally, as the higher-level system is trained via deep reinforcement learning, the robot could learn after deployment, which is ideal for real-world applications.

Those tasks can be either explicitly programmed by an engineer or learned by means of some automatic learning method, which improves the adaptability of the robot and reduces the effort of setting it up. In this sense, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self-adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(λ) (TOSL) with QBIASSR can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks. All of these are promising results towards the possibility of learning much more complex tasks autonomously by a robotic agent."

However, the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a fast low-level control strategy widely used in many control engineering tasks. Classic control theory has contributed with different tuning methods to obtain the gains of PID controllers for specific operation conditions. Nevertheless, when the system is not fully known and the operative conditions are variable and not previously known, classical techniques are not entirely suitable for the PID tuning. To overcome these drawbacks many adaptive approaches have been arisen, mainly from the field of artificial intelligent. In this work, we propose an incremental Q-learning strategy for adaptive PID control. In order to improve the learning efficiency we define a temporal memory into the learning process. While the memory remains invariant, a non-uniform specialization process is carried out generating new limited subspaces of learning.

In this paper, we propose one of the first low-cost systems for this task which
uses only open source, free software and affordable hardware. Our approach is
to track the user's face underneath the HMD utilizing a Convolutional Neural

Adversarial Networks (GAN) for producing RGBD images of the person's face. We
use commodity hardware with low-cost extensions such as 3D-printed mounts and
miniature cameras. Our approach learns end-to-end without manual intervention,
runs in real time, and can be trained and executed on an ordinary gaming

limited in its ability to properly evaluate agents with complex dynamics. In
contrast, SCT explicitly takes the agent's dynamics model into consideration,
and aims to accurately capture how well the agent has approximated the fastest
navigation behavior afforded by its dynamics. While several embodied navigation
works use point-turn dynamics, we focus on unicycle-cart dynamics for our
agent, which better exemplifies the dynamics model of popular mobile robotics
platforms (e.g., LoCoBot, TurtleBot, Fetch, etc.). We also present
RRT*-Unicycle, an algorithm for unicycle dynamics that estimates the fastest

Though developments in sensor technology have resulted in the deployment of robots in specific applications the ability to accurately sense and interact with the environment is still missing. Key challenges to the widespread deployment of robots include the ability to learn models of environmental features based on sensory inputs, bootstrap off of the learned models to detect and adapt to environmental changes, and autonomously tailor the sensory processing to the task at hand. This paper summarizes a comprehensive effort towards such bootstrap learning, adaptation, and processing management using visual input. We describe probabilistic algorithms that enable a mobile robot to autonomously plan its actions to learn models of color distributions and illuminations.

navigation agent learns an effective policy over a diverse action space in a
large heterogeneous environment consisting of more than 2km of travel, through

that performance differences in this simulator-based challenge do not persist

exploit simulator imperfections, abusing collision dynamics to 'slide' along

such exploits do not work in the real world. Our experiments show that it is

promising for specifying such tasks in a relatively simple manner. However, the
strong dependency between the learning method and the task to learn is a
well-known problem that restricts practical implementations of RL in robotics,
often requiring major modifications of parameters and adding other techniques
for each particular task. In this paper we present a practical core
implementation of RL which enables the learning process for multiple robotic
tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods,
this implementation includes a novel approach for action selection, called
Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), which avoids poor performance of the
learning process when the robot reaches new unexplored states. Our approach
takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical
variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, X,Y,{\theta} pose, etc.),
thus experienced sets of states may favor the decision-making process of
unexplored or rarely-explored states. This improvement has a relevant role in
reducing the tuning of the algorithm for particular tasks. Experiments with
real and simulated robots, performed with the software framework also
introduced here, show that our implementation is effectively able to learn
different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. Results also
suggest that the combination of true online SARSA({\lambda}) with QBIASSR can
outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks."

MEC-enabled camera network with uncertainties. We finally evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm by both simulations with real datasets
and system implementation in a real testbed. Evaluation results show that the
performance of the proposed algorithm with distributed inference framework is
promising, by reaching the accuracies of attribute recognition and person
identification up to 92.9% and 96.6% respectively, and significantly reducing
the inference delay by at least 40.6% compared with existing methods."

  using software defined networking","Video continues to dominate network traffic, yet operators today have poor
visibility into the number, duration, and resolutions of the video streams
traversing their domain. Current approaches are inaccurate, expensive, or
unscalable, as they rely on statistical sampling, middle-box hardware, or
packet inspection software. We present {\em iTelescope}, the first intelligent,
inexpensive, and scalable SDN-based solution for identifying and classifying
video flows in real-time. Our solution is novel in combining dynamic flow rules
with telemetry and machine learning, and is built on commodity OpenFlow
switches and open-source software. We develop a fully functional system, train
it in the lab using multiple machine learning algorithms, and validate its
performance to show over 95\% accuracy in identifying and classifying video
streams from many providers including Youtube and Netflix. Lastly, we conduct
tests to demonstrate its scalability to tens of thousands of concurrent
streams, and deploy it live on a campus network serving several hundred real
users. Our system gives unprecedented fine-grained real-time visibility of
video streaming performance to operators of enterprise and carrier networks at
very low cost."

  reinforcement learning","In this article, we show that learned policies can be applied to solve legged
locomotion control tasks with extensive flight phases, such as those
encountered in space exploration. Using an off-the-shelf deep reinforcement
learning algorithm, we trained a neural network to control a jumping quadruped
robot while solely using its limbs for attitude control. We present tasks of
increasing complexity leading to a combination of three-dimensional
(re-)orientation and landing locomotion behaviors of a quadruped robot
traversing simulated low-gravity celestial bodies. We show that our approach
easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each
case. Using sim-to-real transfer, we deploy trained policies in the real world
on the SpaceBok robot placed on an experimental testbed designed for
two-dimensional micro-gravity experiments. The experimental results demonstrate
that repetitive, controlled jumping and landing with natural agility is
possible.Comment: Published in IEEE Transactions on Robotics:
