INTRODUCTION Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining more and more popularity as a research tool in the field of HumanRobot Interaction (HRI) [1][2][3][4]. VR has been used to test teleoperation and collect demonstration data to train machine learning algorithms, which showcased the effectiveness of learning visuomotor skills using data collected by consumer-grade devices [1]. VR teleoperation systems were proposed to crowdsource robotic demonstrations at scale [2]. A VR simulation framework was also proposed to replace the physical robot, as VR can enable high level abstraction in embodiment and multimodal interaction [3]. VR has also been used as a rapid prototyping tool to design in-vehicle interactions and interfaces for self-driving cars, which showed the evocation to genuine responses from test participants [4]. Compared to other HRI experiment methods, VR as an emerging interactive media provides unique advantages. VR HRI has the potential of having higher immersion and fidelity than picture based HRI, video-based HRI and simulated HRI. In situations where the perception of the robot is challenging, compared to on-screen viewing, VR display showed significant improvement on collaborative tasks [5]. When comparing VR HRI to the physical, realworld interaction (Live HRI), there is a trade-off between the two. VR experiences still cannot replace physical experiences due to system limitation, and limited interaction modalities etc. [6]. For example, system limitations such as limited field of view and low display resolution could reduce immersion and presence of the VR experience, resulting in different behaviors from Live experiments. Limited interaction modalities, such as the absence of touch, means that the participant could not feel the robot or even go through the robot, which could potentially break the entire interaction. Figure 1: Photograph of the Live experiment setting However, with the help of the distribution of consumer-grade VR devices and online crowdsourcing platforms, VR HRI has the potential to gain massive data for training robotic behavior and studying HRI related issues. Data collection through VR can also reduce noise and improve the data quality [1], which help to ease data processing and algorithm training. Furthermore, VR HRI experiments can test concepts and interactions without physical robots, making it more resource efficient and less expensive than Live HRI. Less hardware also means that the experiment will be less cumbersome to set up, easier to be reproduced and to ensure experiment quality. In this study, HRI Proxemics (the preferred personal space between a human and a robot) was compared to give a better justification and more basic understanding of the relationship between Live and VR. Proxemics preferences rely on lower level intuition [7], therefore, reflect the differences in the perceptions between Live and VR better. Compared to other HRI subject such as conversational (audio) or gaze behavior (visual), which are more modality dependent, proxemics can give a comprehensive understanding of the human responses. In addition, variations of modalities in VR can greatly influence human perception. For example, a higher visual familiarity of the physical environment in VR can decrease the effect of distance distortion [8]. Auditory inputs play another important role in VR, the addition of spatial sound can increase the sense of presence in VR and provide sound localization [9]. Thus, this work also compares VR settings with variance in modalities to evaluate the impacts of visual familiarity and spatial sound on VR HRI experiments. A 2 x 3 mixed design experiment was conducted to evaluate the differences between Live and VR HRI, as well as the influence of visual familiarity and spatial sound in VR. For the Live HRI, the pepper robot from Softbank Robotics was used (Figure 1). In the VR HRI, a 3D model of the same robot was used. To measure visual familiarity, the VR scene was created in Blender based on a 3D scan of the physical lab. The spatial sound was created by enabling the movement of the physical robot, due to the difficulties of engineering spatial sound. The interaction was implemented in Unity. As an objective measurement for proxemics preference, the minimum comfort distance (MCD) was measured. In addition, for the psychological perception of the experience, the feeling of presence was measured with the SUS questionnaire. For the perception of the robot, two relevant factors, competence and discomfort was measured with the ROSAS questionnaire.",autonomous vehicle,1,not included

Focusing on the ""Intrusion Detection"" problem, we propose a realworld application of our WSN Intrusion Detection System (WIDS). WIDS exploits the Weak Process Models to classify potential security issues in the WSN and to notify the operators when an attack tentative is detected. In this demonstration, we show how our IDS works, how it detects some basic attacks and how the IDS can evolve to fullfil the needs of secure WSN deployments.

The present research has collected characteristics of gestures and physical movements from users made by other related research in order to study the same interaction within a virtual world. Through this research a smaller number of gestures were created improving the user learning curve without affecting the usability. The following implementation uses a client-server architecture composed of 2 Raspberry Pi devices and a Smartphone acting as a server the communication between them was achieved by employing Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The immersive virtual experience is accomplished by using Unity 3D and Google VR tools that allowed the design and display of a playful virtual environment as an approach to promote physical and cognitive skills such as spatial thinking and hand-eye coordination. By performing maneuvers through an aerial circuit filled with obstacles the proposed UAV simulator encourages motor and mental activity while the user is being entertained.

Such technology has reached the maturity to be translated into commercial products, and published works on HMDs provide glimpses of how AR will disrupt the surgical field, allowing for an ergonomic, intuitive, and 3-dimensional fruition of preoperative and intraoperative information. Nowadays several commercial HMDs, such as Microsoft HoloLens, Meta or Magic Leap, integrate tracking and registration technology, and the deployment of software development kits has reduced technical complexity of custom application development, allowing for a wide range of users to easily create AR applications and attracting researchers to explore their potentialities for the implementation of surgical navigators. The above-mentioned HMDs are designed following an optical see-through (OST) approach, which augments the natural view through the projection of virtual reality information on semitransparent displays in front of the userâs eyes. The OST approach fits well in the surgical domain as it offers an instantaneous full-resolution view of the real world, allowing the natural synchronization of visual and proprioceptive information, and a complete situation awareness. Ongoing research is aimed at the goal of providing a device âconceived as a transparent interface between the user and the environment, a personal and mobile window that fully integrates real and virtual information.â1 Commercial companies are rapidly improving HMD ergonomic aspects, for example, HoloLens 2 features an improved field of view (52Â° diagonal), which includes eye tracking, and offers more comfortable wearability. However, maximizing surgical accuracy remains a challenge for manufacturers and researchers. Together with ergonomics, the achievement of precision objectives must be addressed to develop a visor suitable for guiding surgical operations, not to mention compliance with medical device regulations. An increasing number of research studies propose the use of commercial HMDs to guide surgical interventions.2 To the best of our knowledge, these works are principally focused on the need to strengthen virtual/real patient registration (eg, use of an external localization system),3 improve virtual content stability,4 and solve calibration issues, and they underestimate the contribution of perceptual issues to the user accuracy. One of the largest obstacles to obtain a perceptually correct augmentation is the inability to render proper focus cues in HMDs; indeed, the majority of systems offers the AR content at a fixed focal distance, failing to stimulate natural eye accommodation and retinal blur effects.5 Our recent work2 suggests to avoid the use of existing HMD-OST, which are not specifically designed for performing tasks in peripersonal space (<1 m), to guide manual tasks requiring a high level of precision, since perceptual issues, particularly âfocal rivalryâ (ie, inability to see simultaneously in focus the virtual and real content), can affect user performance.5 Most commercial systems (HoloLens, Lumus, Meta, Ora2) indeed have a fixed focal plane at 2 m or more (often infinite).

The enhancement may consist of virtual artifacts to be fitted into the environment or a display of non-geometric information about existing real objects. Mobile AR (MAR) systems implement this interaction paradigm in an environment in which the user moves, possibly over wide areas (Feiner, MacIntyre, Hoellerer, & Webster, 1997). This is in contrast to non-mobile AR systems that are utilized in limited spaces such as a computer-aided surgery or by a technicianâs aid in a repair shop. There are a number of challenges to implementing successful AR systems. These include a proper calibration of the optical properties of cameras and display systems (Tuceryan et al., 1995; Tuceryan, Genc, & Navab, 2002), and an accurate registration of threedimensional objects with their physical counterparts and environments (Breen, Whitaker, Rose, & Tuceryan, 1996; Whitaker, Crampton, Breen, Tuceryan, & Rose, 1995). In particular, as the observer (or an object of interest) moves over time, the 3D graphics need to be properly updated so that the realism of the resulting scene and/or alignment of necessary objects and graphics are maintained. Furthermore, this has to be done in real time and with high accuracy. The technology that allows this real-time update of the graphics as users and objects move is a tracking system that measures the position and orientation of the tracked objects (Koller et al., 1997). The ability to track objects, therefore, is one of the big challenges in MAR systems. This article describes a software framework for realizing such a distributed tracking environment by discovering independently deployed, possibly heterogeneous trackers and fusing the data from them while roaming over a wide area. In addition to the MAR domain, this kind of a tracking capability would also be useful in other domains such as robotics and locationaware applications. The novelty of this research lies in the amalgamation of the theoretical principles from the domains of AR/VR, data fusion, and the distributed software systems to create a sensor-based, wide-area tracking environment.

The design and implementation of these two platforms are discussed in this paper. The key DCF parameters, i.e., the initial contention window size ($CW_{min}$) and the maximum contention window size ($CW_{max}$), are tuneable so that we are able to study the impact of these DCF parameters on the network performance. These experiment results are compared against with a recently proposed unified analytical framework to examine the model assumptions and system performance bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that by adapting the values of $CW_{min}$ based on WiFi traffic load, the maximal network throughput can be achieved, and the optimal value of $CW_{min}$ varies when the network size changes. As a reality check, the emerging software defined WiFi network architecture can be optimized for performance enhancement guided by this unified performance model.",autonomous vehicle,9,not included

We describe our prototype ATPG implementation and results on two real-world data sets: Stanford Universityâs backbone network and Internet. We find that a small number of test packets suffice to test all rules in these networks. A sending 4000 test packet 10 times per second consumes less than 1% of link capacity. ATPG code and the datasets are publicly available.

It is very often used in the world of computers and their use in different connections. The term networking express the link between two or more computers and their tendency, with the vital purpose of sharing the data stored in the computers, with each other. The networks between the computing tendencies are very public these days due to the launch of assorted hardware and computer software which aid in making the activity much more convenient to build and use. Fig: 1.1Structure of Networking between the different computers The discuss about Figure: 1.1 Structure of Networking between the different computer. Its main process of share the Internet to different things and devices. General Network Techniques When computers communicate on a network, they send out information packets without knowing if anyone is listening. Computers in a network all have an attached to the network and that is called to be attached to a network bus. What one computer sends out will reach the other computer on the local area network. Â© 2017 IJEDR | Volume 5, Issue 1 | ISSN: 2321-9939 IJEDR1701073 International Journal of Engineering Development and Research (www.ijedr.org) 476 Fig: 1.2 the clear idea about the networking functions The discus about figure: 1.2 clear ideas of network function and different computers to be able to distinguish between each other, every computer have unique ID called MAC-address Media Access Control Address. This address is not only unique on your network but unique for all tendencies that can be aquiline up to a network. The MAC-address is tied to the hardware and has nothing to do with IP-addresses. Since all computers on the network graduate inversion that is sent out from all other computers the MACaddresses is primarily used by the computers to filter out incoming network traffic that is addressed to the scratcher computer. When a computer expostulation with another computer on the network, it sends out both the other computers MAC-address and the MACaddress of its own. In that way the receiving computer will not only realize that this parcel is for me but also, who sent this data packet so a return response can be sent to the sender. Ethernet network as delineate here, all computers hear all network aggregation since they are attached to the same bus. This network structure is called multi-drop. One problem with this network structure is that when you have, let say ten computers on a network and they expostulation attendance and due to that they sends out there data packets randomly, collisions occur when two or more computers sends data at the same time. When that happens data gets imperfect and has to be resent. On a network that is heavy loaded even the resent packets collide with other packets and have to be resent again. In reality this soon takes affect an information problem. If respective computers communicate with each other at high speed they may not be able to utilize more than 25% of the total network information measure since the rest of the bandwidth is used for regressive antecedently corrupted packets. The way to minimize this problem is to use network switches. II.RELATED NETWORK Detecting the occurrence and location of performance anomalies is critical to ensuring the effective operation of network infrastructures. In this paper we present a framework for detecting and apposition performance anomalies based on using an active investigate measurement infrastructure deployed on the periphery of a network. Our framework has three components: an algorithm for detection performance oddball on a path, an algorithm for environs which paths to probe at a given time in order to detect performance anomalies where a path is defined as the set of links between two sampling nodes, and an algorithm for designation the links that are causing an identified anomaly on a path The path selection algorithm is designed to enable a interchange between insure that all links in a network are of times monitored to detect performance anomalies, while minimizing probing overhead.[1] This paper, we develop failure-resilient techniques for monitoring link detain and imbecility in a Service Provider or endeavor IP network. Our two-phased approach attempts to minimize both the monitoring infrastructure costs as well as the additional aggregation due to probe messages. In the first phase, we compute the particular point of a minimal set of monitoring stations such Â© 2017 IJEDR | Volume 5, Issue 1 | ISSN: 2321-9939 IJEDR1701073 International Journal of Engineering Development and Research (www.ijedr.org) 477 that all network links are covered, even in the bigness of several link reverting. Afterwards, in the second phase, we compute a minimal set of probe messages that are transmitted by the stations to measure link delays and isolate network faults these approximation ratios are provably very close to the best possible bounds for any algorithm. [2]We present a new symbolic execution tool, KLEE, capable of automatically induce tests that wangle high coverage on a diverse set of complex and environmentallyintense programs. We used KLEE to thoroughly check all 89 stand-alone programs in the GNU COREUTILS utility suite, which form the core user-level environment position on millions of UNIX systems, and arguably are the single most heavily tested set of open-source programs in existence. KLEE-generated tests achieve high line coverage on average over 90% per tool. [3] The emergence of Open Flow-capable switches enables exciting new network functionality, at the risk of programming errors that make communication less reliable. The centralized programming model, where a single accountant program manages the network, seems to reduce the likelihood of bugs. However, the system is inherently scattered and asynchronous, with events happening at different switches and end hosts, and inevitable delays affecting communication with the controller. In this paper, we present economic, regular techniques for testing unqualified controller programs. Our NICE tool applies model checking to explore the state space of the entire system the controller, the switches, and the hosts. [4] Network performance tomography, characteristics of the network interior, such as link loss and packet latency, is inferred from unrelated end-to-end measurements. Most work to date is based on employ packet level correlations. However, these methods are often limited in scope-multicast is not widely deployed-or require deployment of additional hardware or software system. Some recent work has been successful in reaching a less detailed goal: identifying the lossiest network links using only unrelated end-toend sampling. In this paper, we abstract the properties of network performance that allow this to be done and exploit them with a quick and simple deduction algorithm that, with high likely, separate the worst performing links.

These smart sensors/actuators are being networked together through: either standards based or industry specific, proprietary, wired networks or newly emerging wireless networking technologies. Presently, at the twoand four-year college level, technicians and technologists in a wide variety of impacted disciplines are not receiving an adequate education about: fundamental sensor theory, basic sensor operation, sensor system deployment planning, appropriate data-transport and networking connectivity schemes, applications software, and impending system maintenance support needs of these increasingly more sophisticated and complex, smart sensor/actuator based systems. This paper will report on the development, organization, and use of a novel interdisciplinary sensor networks laboratory. The heart of the laboratory is a dedicated data-network (SensorNet) that emulates a wide area network or WAN. The SensorNet WAN nodes and other network access points allow for the interconnection of numerous types of industry specific and standard âarea networksâ typically utilized for the gathering of sensor data and directing other sensor functions, as well as, the associated PCâs and servers used to direct the sensor systems and warehouse the gathered data. This laboratory environment lends itself to real world case-study and problem-based type student-centered learning experiences that can be themselves integrated into established fields of technology that do not normally include this type of activity as part of the fieldâs traditional educational experience at the undergraduate level. I. Overview Although it is not uncommon for several different technology fields to converge together, it is somewhat unexpected to observe such an amalgamation rapidly triggering other technologic innovations that have widespread potential to change our relationship with the environment and our daily endeavors. However, this is just what is happening today. Only a short time ago, the Internet, the result of a convergence of several technologies, spawned the development of what is commonly known as the âInformation Economy.â Today another innovative and important convergence of technologies has recently gained critical mass and recognition by business and industry, government, academia, and professional societies. It is the deployment of intricate systems involving complex sensors with embedded (ambient) intelligence and advanced actuators coupled with modern data-transport and networking technologies and applicationenabling software with data fusion capabilities. This rapidly evolving convergence of technologies, which allows us to implement sensor systems that gather in situ (remote), realtime, statistically relevant information and interpret it in new and novel ways, has already started to transform automation and process control systems. The technology of networked sensor systems has the very genuine potential to significantly impact almost every aspect of human endeavor by increasing system efficiency, reducing energy consumption, permitting the real-time monitoring of the âhealthâ of the nationâs infrastructure and environment, and improving public health and safety. Applications are limitless! P ge 1.77.3 On a global level, the NSF has been calling this âgrand convergence,â cyberinfrastructure. One may find many references to this concept, forecasts of potential future applications, reports on inprogress test projects such as HPWREN, NIMS, and ROADnet, and potential research funding opportunities on the NSFâs Web site [1] . However, most of this current, enthusiastic attention and promotion of cyberinfrastructure by the NSF is aimed at senior, graduate-level research institutions. Not surprisingly, most of the NSFâs recent Requests for Proposals (RFPs) in this area have been targeted at basic research about wireless sensor networks and systems and applications of these systems to infrastructure and environmental monitoring and other technology areas. While many applications of networked sensor systems are yet to be even thought of, the reality is that they are being deployed today and will continue to proliferate for many years to come until they eventually become as commonplace as a typical public utility like electricity. This paper describes aspects of an NSF funded CCLI project (DUE 0736888), titled, âThe Sensor Networks Education Projectâ (SNEP) that seeks to develop materials and a model teaching laboratory that will be useful for other faculty and organizations at the twoand even the four-year college level to emulate. This project looks at this evolving convergence on a more practical level and speaks to the lack of engineering technology faculty expertise and teaching materials needed to infuse the newly recognized, exponentially growing knowledge base of networked sensor technology into the curricula and hence into the skill-sets of todayâs twoand four-year technical college graduates â the technicians and technologists of tomorrow. This is the community of workers that will most likely deal with the design, deployment, updating, and maintenance of these systems. Today, networks of legacy and newer sophisticated sensors that combine reconfigurable gigascale semiconductor technology with emerging micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology subsystems [2] (i.e. bio-systems/chemical/molecular/photonic) are being designed and deployed in almost every area of technology that impacts human endeavor and commerce (i.e. Aerospace, Agriculture, Automotive, Biomedical, Building Automation, Energy Exploration and Production, Environmental Monitoring, Healthcare, Homeland Security, Industrial Automation, Infrastructure Monitoring, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Military, Pharmaceutical, Telecomm, Transportation, Weather Forecasting, etc). These sensors are being networked together through: either standards based or industry proprietary wired networks or emerging wireless networking technologies. Presently, at the twoand four-year college level, technologists and technicians in a wide variety of impacted disciplines are not receiving an adequate education about: fundamental sensor theory, basic sensor operation, sensor system deployment planning, appropriate data-transport and networking connectivity schemes, applications software, and impending system maintenance support needs of these increasingly more sophisticated sensor based systems. Recently, there has been a great deal of public dialogue about the out-sourcing of American manufacturing jobs and the effect of this reality on the nationâs future. Dealing with an ever increasing base of physical sensor networks in all areas of endeavor will not be something that can be done through a call to a help desk located in a foreign country. The apparent curriculum shortcoming regarding these topics within todayâs associate and bachelors degree technology oriented programs is primarily due to the extremely rapid evolution and convergence of several key areas of electronics, computer, and MEMS technology (i.e. embedded processing, smart P ge 1.77.4 sensors/actuators, wired and wireless networking, etc), the lack of appropriate up-to-date educational materials, and a lack of appropriate faculty expertise in this rapidly expanding and remarkably cross-disciplinary field. II. Project Overview Over its two-year life-span, this CCLI Phase I project has as its primary goals the creation and testing of interdisciplinary student-centered learning materials primarily designed for a âfield laboratoryâ type environment, the dissemination of these materials, and the development of faculty expertise in the multi-disciplinary field of networked sensors and modern active-learner teaching techniques. To accomplish these goals the project will: (1) develop and deploy a model, innovative, replicate-able, multi-interdisciplinary, case-study and problem-based oriented, networked, distributed sensor laboratory, (2) develop basic and advanced instructional materials and standard and âhybridâ laboratory activities related to the sensor laboratory that can be utilized for introductory courses in sensor technology or more advanced courses in networked sensor systems for use by both twoand four-year technology programs, (3) develop several prototype multifaceted educational modules that integrate traditional science and math based theory, practical real-world laboratory exercises, and science based, high-resolution, interactive simulation software, applicable to several of the major technology areas employing networked sensor technology (i.e. building automation and infrastructure monitoring and industrial automation), and (4) provide on-going local, regional, and national dissemination of these developed materials and laboratory experiences through hands-on faculty workshops and webbased distribution technologies including the National Science Digital Library (NSDL). In addition, for the duration of the project, continuous on-going professional development in the principles and applications of student-centered and active learner techniques will be provided to the recruited college faculty that will take part in the project. Research has shown that long term professional development programs are more effective than short-term workshops. For this project to be successful, the participating faculty must learn how to effectively integrate content and pedagogy in a way that actively engages students in individual and collaborative problem solving, analysis, synthesis, critical thinking, reasoning, and skillfully applying knowledge in real-w",autonomous vehicle,11,not included

The sensor is not a pure data source, but an entity (Semantic Sensor Web) with associated metadata and it is a building block of a âworldwide distributedâ real time database, to be processed through real-time queries. Important challenges are to achieve interoperability in connectivity and processing capabilities (queries) and to apply âintelligenceâ and processing capabilities as close as possible to the source of data. This paper presents the extension of a general architecture for data integration in which we add capabilities for processing of complex queries and discuss how they can be adapted to, and used by, an application in the Semantic Sensor Web, presenting a pilot study in environment and health domains. 1 Background and Motivation The rapid development and deployment of sensor technology involves many different types of sensors, both remote and in situ, with such diverse capabilities as range, modality, and manoeuvrability. It is possible today to utilize networks with multiple sensors to detect and identify objects of interest up close or from a great distance. Connected Objects â or the Internet of Things â is expected to be a significant new market and encompass a large variety of technologies and services in different domains. Transport, environmental management, health, agriculture, domestic appliances, building automation, energy efficiency will benefit of real-time reality mining, personal decision support capabilities provided by the growing information shadow (i.e. data traces) of people, goods and objects supplied by the huge data available from the emerging sensor Web [1]. Vertical applications can be developed to connect to and communicate with objects tailored for specific sub domains, service enablement to face fragmented connectivity, device standards, application information protocols etc. and device management. Building extending connectivity, connectivity tailored for object communication â with regards to business model, service level, billing etc, are possible exploitation areas of the Internet Connected Objects. Important challenges are to achieve interoperability in connectivity and processing capabilities (queries, etc.), to distribute âintelligenceâ and processing capabilities as close as possible to the source of data (the Giordani I., Toscani D., Archetti F. and Cislaghi M..

The sensor is not a pure data source, but an entity (Semantic Sensor Web) with associated domain metadata, capable of autonomous processing and it is a building block of a âworldwide distributedâ real time database, to be processed through realtime queries. The vision of the Semantic Sensor Web promises to unify the real and the virtual world by integrating sensor technologies and Semantic Web technologies. Sensors and their data will be formally described and annotated in order to facilitate the common integration, discovery and querying of information. Since this semantic information ultimately needs to be communicated by the sensors themselves, one may wonder whether existing techniques for processing, querying and modeling sensor data are still applicable under this increased load of transmitted data. In the following of this paper we introduce the state of the art in data querying over network of data providers. In Sect. 2 we present the software architecture of a data integration system in which we added complex query processing features. Sect. 3 introduces the case study in which we deployed our system: the study of short term effect of air pollution on health. Sect. 4 presents the detailed implementation of the querying features together with results on real data sets. Finally, Sect 5 presents the conclusions and future work. 1.1 State of the Art This paper stems from the work presented in [12], in which is presented a software system aimed at forecasting the demand of patient admissions on health care structures due to environmental pollution. The target users of this decision sup-port tool are health care managers and public administrators, which need help in resource allocation and policies implementation. The key feature of that system was the algorithmic kernel, to perform time series analysis through Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models (AHMM) [7]. The scenario in which the system has been deployed is the research project LENVIS1, which is aimed to create a network of services for data and information sharing based on heterogeneous and distributed data sources and modeling. One of the innovations brought by LENVIS is the âservice oriented business intelligenceâ, i.e. an approach to Business Intelligence in which the information presented to the user comes from data processing that is performed online, i.e. data are extracted under request of the applications, and on the basis of data availability, i.e. data are exchanged through web services, which does not guarantee response time neither availability. Such a complex environment, in which data sources are distributed over the internet, is common to several problems and has been faced by different approaches. One of them is that of [13], in which âmonitoring queriesâ continuously collect data about spatially-related physical phenomena. An algorithm, called Adaptive Pocket Driven Trajectories, is used to select data collection paths based on the spatial layout of sen1 LENVIS Localised environmental and health information services for all.

This implies a growing demand of computing resources that severely exploits computational environments in terms of sustainability and reliability of the infrastructure.
 The developments in computing hardware and software, in particular the deployment of world-wide reliable Grid Computing infrastructures, the adoption of innovative computing approaches like the General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) Computing and the High Performance Network environments, stimulate the exploitation of new approaches and methodologies in Computational Sciences. Furthermore the advances made in the World Wide Web, allow the implementation of Web sites from which the simulation of elementary chemical processes at molecular level is performed combining various techniques and computational approaches which are executed on High Throughput Computing (HTC) and/or High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms.
 The ubiquity of information and computing resources has impacted on the researchers? productivity, in a similar way the same technologies impacted everyone?s daily life. The E-science technologies facilitate the exchange of information among researchers, enhance the collaborative work and increase the quality of dissemination of results. Several European initiatives are devoted to facilitate researchers? work and to establish networks among researchers of the various disciplines, enabling some European research groups to reach leading positions in their disciplines. We have got the support of the EU COST (COllaboration in Science and Technology) Initiative in two Actions devoted to the facilitation of adoption of Grid and Distributed Computing technologies in Molecular and Matter Sciences. In particular I participated to the COST D23 Action: Metachem - Metalaboratories for Complex Computational Applications in Chemistry (2000-2005), and I coordinated the Working Group: Simbex: a metalaboratory for the a priori simulation of crossed molecular Beam Experiments. Furthermore I participated to the COST D37 Action: Grid Computing in Chemistry: GRIDCHEM (2006-2009), and I coordinated the Working Group: ELAMS: E-science and Learning Approaches in Molecular Science.
 The outcomes of both COST Actions contributed significantly to establish an active group of Computational Chemistry and Molecular and Matter Science laboratories which adopted the Grid Computing as an innovative computing paradigm for performing massive computational campaigns.
 Since 2004 the researchers of such laboratories joined the Virtual Organization (VO) CompChem established on the EGEE Grid Infrastructure, the largest distributed computing environment ever established worldwide, and coordinated by CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire). I served as VO Manager since the VO was established, under the coordination of Prof. Antonio Lagana, Department of Chemistry, University of Perugia.
 The present thesis covered a long period of research work focused on implementing some e-science instruments to the computational chemistry community, in particular the community of users belonging to the COMPCHEM Virtual Organization active in the EGEE/EGI European Grid Initiative.
 The Thesis describes some tools and approaches the author adopted to provide innovative tools to the Computational Chemistry community based on two main pillars:
1. approaches for running large computational campaigns on Grid Infrastructures 2. adopting virtual reality techniques for making more intuitive the interaction with nanoscale computing approaches and simplifying the definition of the initial conditions of the molecular simulations
 The research work originated 10 research papers, several of them produced as a joint work with European laboratories interested in the implementation of e-science tools for a smart, curious and demanding community like the Computational Chemistry one.
 The author has been able to provide a useful view of the molecular world through the use of virtual reality techniques, combined with the most advanced Web technologies, in particular using the ISO standard X3D for the 3D visualization and interaction with a virtual world. These innovative tools enabled the researchers to set up the environment for carrying out complex molecular simulations (as in the case of the Dl-Poly software package) in a intuitive and visual way. Once defined the species interacting in the considered molecular system, represented in a virtual world, the system produce the input file for the simulation and the Dl-Poly program may be launched, possibly on a Grid infrastructure to take benefit of the powerful available computational resources.
 In chapters 1, 2 and 3 the various steps toward the implementation of an a-priori molecular simulator on the EGEE/EGI Grid, for the COMPCHEM VO users, are reported.
 Molecular Virtual Reality applications are really useful as e-learning support tools for Chemistry students. To this purpose we implemented a Learning Management System based on a semantic web approach, described in chapter 7, and an assessment system, described in chapter 8, which have been used several times to assess the competences of students participating to the Erasmus Mundus Master of Science in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modeling. The system enables the coordinators of the Master to monitor the progresses made by the students an a daily basis.
 The author has shown how it is possible to use virtual reality approaches to describe a chemical experiment at both human and molecular level using a virtual reality approach. To this end a multi-scale virtual reality approach has been adopted to deal with the description of the physical environment,HVR. The main features of the virtual reality representation of the experiments and the potentiality of associating VRML and X3D with Java engine calculator are outlined in chapter 4.
 In chapter 5 an X3D Molecular Virtual Reality environment in which the researcher is able to interact with it by using immersive devices and dynamic gestures is described. By using the gestures the researcher is able to modify the composition of the molecular system by adding or subtracting functions and the molecular properties of the new species are evaluated in real time by invoking a Web Service implementing the simulation environment. This has required the assemblage of an innovative approach coupling the management of immersive devices with Web Services and molecular dynamics packages.
 In chapter 6 the author has presented an X3D Molecular Virtual Reality environment which makes usage of the most recent and powerful HTML and Web technologies. The approach implemented takes into account the modern approaches followed in implementing Social Networking environments and showed how useful these approaches are also in implementing scientific environments. We think such type of work is important also in consideration of how our lifestyle is changing, thanks to the ubiquity of the information, the availability of an increasing availability of storage and computing power. The social networking showed us how deep may be the impact of the computing and networking facility in the daily life and similarly the computational science, and the computational chemistry in particular, has to reshape the classical approaches and methodologies in order to gain advantage of the modern computing platforms and the powerfulness of the networking, distributed and mobile environments.",autonomous vehicle,14,not included

E-learning is usually used in distance learning and may be used to replace conventional classroom teaching. Many educational institutions use Internet for collaborative learning in a distributed educational process. It has been known that traditional communications media can be replaced by electronic communication for the whole educational process and in particular, to assess the role of collaborative learning in a distributed education environment. It has been found that a distributed educational process naturally supports collaborative learning environments in which students and tutors interact and provide essential support for students studying at a distance. The tutorâs feedback to students help the learning process and there is indication that tutors are happy to work in the new environment. It is therefore suggested that âblendedâ online teaching â a combination of the use of the Internet as a medium of instruction and tutors to do face-to-face teaching via a collaborative learning approach â may be implemented to achieve enhanced distance-student performance.

(2002) defined elearning as: â... a generic term for all technologically supported learning using an array of teaching and learning tools as phone bridging, audio and videotapes, teleconferencing, satellite transmissions, and the more recognized web-based training or computer aided instruction also commonly referred to as online courses...â. Today, e-learning has become an extremely popular alternative means of delivering educational services worldwide mainly because it is seen as a means of resolving significant educational problems that cannot be solved by conventional means. E-learning is particularly used in open and distance learning (ODL) as it can provide flexible education for those who cannot attend regular schooling particularly because they are unable to leave their work to attend regular conventional classes. Additionally, in an archipelagic country like Indonesia, where the bulk of the population is spread over thousands of islands, educational services are made more accessible through ODL. Most ODL programmes in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, deploy any one or a combination of the following media: print, radio, television, audiocassettes, videocassettes and computers. Generally, the course materials of ODL programmes in the region are largely print-based. It is likely that this will continue for a long time. However, by increasing the use of computers and information and communication technology (ICT), the role of the printed-based course materials will be replaced gradually by e-learning. MOJIT Effectiveness Of Collaborative Learning In Online Teaching* 69 The development of ICT is moving rapidly because of its pertinent role in providing education to the masses. In fact, by effectively deploying ICT, the educational institutions concerned can cope with, and cater to, the expanding student population. In general, it has been observed that the use of ICT in education in Indonesia has resulted in relatively successful outcomes. There have been numerous problems, however, but there is one significant issue that may be cited here because of its implications to future endeavours in education in Indonesia and in the Southeast Asian region as well. This issue has direct influence over the learning process. It is called transactional distance. The physical separation of teacher and student is no longer a problem given the developments in ICT. However, with ICT use, transactional distance can easily result in a misunderstanding and miscomprehension of the concepts to be learned. In fact, it can even lead to the mal-education of people, following a lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. If there is no communication, however, this transactional distance between learner and teacher becomes wider. THE NEW LEARNING PARADIGM In 1995, the International Council on Distance Education (ICDE) conducted what it called an anecdotal, worldwide survey to determine the nature, reality and pace of the shift in the learning paradigm (ICDE, 1996). The survey noted the following clear signs: o A shift from objective knowledge to constructed knowledge. o A shift from an industrial-based to a knowledge-based society. o A shift in education missions from providing instruction to providing learning. o A shift in technologically-mediated procedures of communication and learning. o A shift from âcurrent college and university models to as yet undetermined structures.â Over the last five years, the fifth observation of ICDE has become very clear. The âundetermined structureâ at the time of the ICDE survey has come to be known as the virtual learning structure. Experts made similar observations from the ICTsector at about the same time period (Soekartawi et al., 2002). The importance of the virtual campus in the Indonesian context has been reported by Soekartawi (2002, 2002a, 2003) and Haryono & Alatas (2002). According to Garmer & Firestone (1996), due to the development of ICT, the paradigm for learning is shifting away from the traditional notion that ââknowledgeâ is transferred from teacher to student within the confines of the classroom where the focus of the teaching-learning process before was the teacher; now, it is shifting to the learner. A new understanding of learning places the learner at the centre of the learning process, with the teacher serving an important supporting role in facilitating the process (Garmer & Firestone, 1996). In this new paradigm, successful learning is measured by the individualâs ability to apply appropriate tools and information to solve problems in real life. There is a challenge in this new concept of learning. It is necessary to unlearn old habits and notions of how learning should be structured and to develop new habits of instruction that motivate learners to take greater control over their own education (Garmer & Firestone, 1996). This is what generally known by the âfirst concernâ which should be to understand the learnerâs motivations and goals in order that we can expand opportunities for learning. This new paradigm has critical implications for the use of ICT (e-learning) in education, particularly for ODL. For one, it requires that the learner take on more responsibility and autonomy in his learning. This is something that the learner may not be comfortable with or prepared to assume completely at this time. For another, teachers will have to give up control over the learning process and take on a new role similar to that of educational coaches who spend more time on the sidelines MOJIT Effectiveness Of Collaborative Learning In Online Teaching* 70 watching and maybe making plans for a more effective learning environment. The new paradigm has also highlighted an important issue. There is a need for all learners to upgrade their skills, particularly skills to learn on their own. This largely requires an ability to seek, understand and use information, which, in turn, requires the ability to use technology. In todayâs world, for example, one must be computer literate to gain access to information and new knowledge. COLLABORATIVE LEARNING One of the critical factors in online learning is the quality issue. Many efforts can be used to meet this issue, among them obtaining feedback evaluation from the student. Further, a crucial aspect of successful distance education is the quality of feedback on student assignments. The electronic assignment handling system pioneered in these trials has now been adopted by the Open University at large and will serve a big number of students. Collaborative learning, therefore, can be used to improve the issue of quality in distance learning. Collaborative learning is an essential ingredient in the recipe to create an ""effective learning environment"" as it provides learners with the opportunity to discuss, argue, negotiate and reflect upon existing beliefs and knowledge. The learner is ""...involved in constructing knowledge through a process of discussion and interaction with learning peers and experts...."" Harasim (in Thomas, 1999, p.51). To facilitate collaboration so that personal knowledge can be constructed, there needs to be a purpose for the collaboration and the purpose needs to be meaningful to the learner. Thus, it is important that an appropriate context is set for the collaborative activity, for example, assigning a ""real world"" task for learners or a problem to which all learners can relate. In addition to setting the context, there needs to be a vehicle through which collaboration can take place. In traditional faceto-face educational settings, collaboration mostly occurs through conversation, that is, individuals interacting with one another via the use of language. Therefore, in terms of creating an effective learning environment, four attributes surface as being paramount: â¢ Providing opportunities to foster personal construction of knowledge â¢ Setting an appropriate context for learning to create the opportunities. â¢ Facilitating collaboration amongst learners. â¢ Using conversation to facilitate collaboration. Petre (1998) argued that while superficially it might appear that distance learning/education is the domain of the distance educator, the aims of educational institutions are similar in ideology; according to Thomas (1999), only the implementations differ. However, what distance educators brings to this arena is the experience of how to interact with students and tutors who are geographically and temporally remote from a campus as well as from one another. The ultimate objective is to diminish and even remove the barriers that remoteness erects. In general, the learning environment in the Open University can be described",autonomous vehicle,15,not included

Indeed, Business Process Management (BPM) has focused on relatively mature operations, with the goal of improving performance through automation. However, in todayâs world of customer-centricity and individualized services, the richest source of economic value-creation comes from enterprise-customer contacts beyond transactions. Consequently, process has recently moved out of its traditional court and is becoming prevalent in less traditional competences such as marketing operations, customer-relationship management, campaign creation and monitoring, brand management, sales and advisory services, multi-channel management, service innovation and management life-cycle, among others. These competences host customerenterprise co-creation activities characterized by innovation, human creativity, and new technologies. Above all, these work-practices call for continuous differentiation, instead of âpouring concreteâ on emerging business processes. While BPM will continue to make important contributions to the factory of enterprises, Business Process Engineering (BPE) is chartered to provide a holistic approach to new opportunities related to the life-cycle of enterprise customers and the transformation of so-called Front-Office Operations. More broadly, Business Process Engineering fosters a new space for the multidisciplinary study of process, integrating individuals, information and technology, and it does so with the goal of engineering (i.e., designing and running) innovative enterprise operations to serve customers and improve their experiences. Furthermore, given past challenges in the Back-Office, it is imperative that managers focus on processes in the Front-Office where the software industry has jumped into with solutions that bury key processes within applications, thus making differentiation and agility very difficult. BPE stresses the critical importance of the integration of Information and Behavior and it is this goal that links it with Business Informatics: the information process in organizations and society. Since behavior and information are complementary and inseparable domains of concern, current approaches to decision making based on data-only evidence should be reexamined holistically: it may be catastrophic to explicate or predict the behavior of organizations or individuals meaningfully by insisting on the ongoing divorce across the two domains. In particular, Business Informatics and Business Process Engineering offer an opportunity to address potential benefits of âbig dataâ and âbusiness analyticsâ beyond the IT domain. Having IEEE lead these directions means an opportunity for stimulating new research and practice on the most fundamental problems that enterprises and customers face today in dealing with each other. Keywordsâ business process engineering; customer experience; business process management; business informatics; enterprise engineering I. PROCESS IS OUT OF THE INDUSTRIALIZATION BOX Business process has been at the center of the stage in both research and industry for several decades. Under the brand of Business Process Management (BPM), business process has attracted a great deal of attention from many practitioners and scholars. BPM has been defined as the analysis, design, implementation, optimization and monitoring of business processes [70], [219], [79], [229], [230]. In [266], Van der Aalst defined some targets of BPM: â ... supports business processes using methods, techniques, and software to design, enact, control and analyze operational processes involving humans, organizations, applications, documents and other sources of informationâ . While the above definitions are quite comprehensive and broad, in reality most BPM research and industry activity has grwon upon the motivation of reducing operating costs through automation, optimization and outsourcing. There are a several schools of thought and practice (such as lean, lean sixsigma, and others [172], [6], [4], [5]) and a myriad of related literature in the last 40 years that serve to illustrate the focus on cost contention. Around the middle of the past decade, T. Davenport stated in a celebrated Harvard Business Review paper [54] that processes were being âanalyzed, standardized, and quality checkedâ, and that this phenomenon was happening for all sort of activities, stated in Davenportâs own terms: âfrom making a mouse trap to hiring a CEOâ. The actual situation is that industry investment and consequential research have stayed much more on âtrapping the mouseâ than in differentiating customer services through innovative and more intelligent processes, let alone hiring CEOs. This may be explained partly from Davenportâs own statements: âProcess standards could revolutionize how businesses work. They could dramatically increase the level and breadth of outsourcing and reduce the number of processes that organizations decide to perform for themselvesâ (bold face is added here for emphasis). With the advent of different technologies such as mobile, cloud, social media, and related capabilities that have empowered consumers, the classical approach and scope of business process have begun to change quickly. Organizations are adopting new operating models [100] that will drastically affect the way processes are conceived and deployed. As stated by many authors in the last four decades, business process work is supposed to cover all competences in an organization, irrespective of the specific skills from human beings participating in such operations. However, in an unpublished inspection of about 1,300 papers conducted by 1 Van der Aalst excludes strategy processes from BPM, a remarkable point that will be revisited in more depth later in this paper. the author and some of his collaborators 2 , most process examples shown in the literature deal with rather simple forms of coordination of work, mostly exhibiting a flow structure and addressing administrative tasks (like those captured in early works on office information systems). Furthermore, the examples provided usually deal with rather idealized operations, probably offered as simple examples with the only purpose of illustrating theoretical or foundational research results. Thus, radically simplified versions of âmanaging an orderâ, âapproving a formâ, âprocessing a claimâ, âpaying a providerâ, âdelivering an orderâ etc. are among the most popular examples of processes found in the literature. The lack of public documentation of substantial collections of real-world processes is remarkable. The authors in [106] both confirmed the dominant focus on simple business processes and also suggested potential practical consequences of related research: â... there is a growing and very active research community looking at process modeling and analysis, reference models, workflow flexibility, process mining and process-centric service-oriented architecture (SOA). However, it is clear that existing approaches have problems dealing with the enormous challenges real-life BPM projects are facing [ ... ] Conventional BPM research seems to focus on situations with just a few isolated processes ...â. Of course, the list of available real-world processes would be a lot richer if one included the set defined by enterprise packaged applications [219]. However, this comprehensive collection is proprietary because it constitutes a key piece of intellectual capital coming from software vendors or integrators in the industry. The traditional focus on process has also raised much controversy. At the S-BPM ONE Conference in 2010, a keynote speaker [176] remarked: âLet me be as undiplomatic as I possibly can be without being offensive [...] The academic community is as much to blame [...] as the vendors of BPM systems, who continue to reduce the task of managing business processes to a purely technological and automation-oriented levelâ. While other authors in the same conference debated âwho is to blameâ very animatedly [78], [234] it is important to highlight that the statement from Olbrich (in bold face above for emphasis) reinforces that BPM has mostly followed the obsession of automation and optimization by means of Information Technology. A detailed inspection of the extant literature confirms that business process work has been devoted to a rather small fraction of the actual variety and complexity found in enterprise behavior. This behavior enacts many valuegenerating capabilities that organizations cultivate based on skills provided by their own workforces and through rich interactions with other enterprise stakeholders, particularly customers. The following points offer a simplified summary: 2 At the time of this publication in IEEE, the mentioned work still remains unpublished. The co-authors are L. Flores and V. Becker both from IBM. (1) Business process research in Computer Science has been traditionally focused on certain classes of enterprise operations, mostly involving simple coordination mechanisms across tasks. This type of coordination and the overall behavior represented in underlying models reflect very much an âassembly lineâ where work is linearly synchronized to deliver a desired artifact or outcome. Simplicity of the choreography is ensured by removing any form of overhead in communication when moving from one stage to the next. Unlike other more complex business processes, many software applications do have this simplified structure. In fact, a trend since the early 2000âs is to separate the specific application logic from the coordination / choreography needed across modules, and both of them from the actual data contained in a data-base management system. Different foundations and a plethora of languages have been created to capture this semantics of coordination such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), Business Process Execution Languag",autonomous vehicle,16,not included

(STI) has developed a versatile new system for parachute mission planning and rehearsal, combining the validated technology of STI's PC-based PARASIMï£ª parachute simulation system with real-time interactive networking, powerful scene generation graphics tools, and terrain-correlated wind fields. This Tactical Insertion Mission Planning and Rehearsal Simulator (TIMPARS) was developed under the SBIR program, funded by the US Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The TIMPARS system rests on four cornerstones: the PARASIM ï£ª simulation software, the real-time interactive network, the scene generation toolkit, and the terrain-correlated wind generation module. These elements combine to produce a system with which users can utilize geospecific terrain data and imagery to recreate a real-world site as a simulation scene, input actual or forecasted wind speeds and directions at altitude above the chosen location to generate a terrain-correlated wind field specific to the simulation scene, and then plan and rehearse a mission in a real-time simulation environment with multiple live participants interacting in the same virtual space. BACKGROUND STI's original parachute simulator was developed for use by smokejumpers, US Forestry Service airborne firefighters. Designed to teach round and ramair canopy control, this early version employed rudimentary graphics with a fixed monitor; users stood before the display monitor and pulled simple toggle lines to maneuver in the simulation. Despite the austere configuration, this version provided the minimum cues required to teach parachute flight safely at low cost. In 1996, STI launched a major development effort to incorporate new photo- realistic graphics and head-mounted display/virtual reality technology into the simulator. Subsequent development efforts produced malfunctions procedures software, riser controls, harness switches, and additional simulator improvements. The implementation of these enhanced simulators by the US Marine Corps (USMC) and the Military Freefall School in Yuma, AZ, resulted in a drastic drop in the rate of training injuries. In particular, the USMC First Force Reconnaissance Company experienced a 75% reduction in main canopy cutaways after implementing the enhanced simulator in the MC-5 static line deployed ram-air parachute system (SLDRAPS) transition course at Camp Pendleton, CA.

Unfortunately, currently available systems for pervasive computing, emerged from both academic and industrial research, can be adopted only on a small fraction of the devices already deployed or in production in the next future. In this paper we present an extensible programming infrastructure that turns mass-market phones into a platform for pervasive computing. 1 Mobile phone: a platform for pervasive computing Pervasive computing tries to make M. Weiserâs vision [1] a reality by saturating the environment with computing and communication devices: the most of the infrastructure is often invisible and supports userâs activities with an interaction model that is strongly human-centric. Today, almost fifteen years later, despite significant progresses in both hardware and software technologies, this vision is still not completely realizable or economically convenient. Supporting the interaction between users and the environment can be greatly simplified if we relax the interaction model and include a personal device as the access medium. Mobile phones are the most obvious candidates: they are in constant reach of their users, have wireless connectivity capabilities, and are provided with increasing computing power [2]. Even better results can be achieved with those phones that are equipped with a camera. Instead of manually getting information or editing configurations, users can point physical objects to express their will of using them: taking a picture of the objects would suffice to setup the link with the offered services. Relaying on an image acquisition device does not impose a strict limit to the share of possible users, since an always growing number of commercially available mobile phone is equipped with an integrated camera: according to recent studies [3], over 175 million camera phones were shipped in 2004 and, by the end of the decade, the global population of camera phones is expected to surpass 1 billion. ? This work is partially supported by the Italian Ministry for Education and Scientific Research (MIUR) in the framework of the FIRB-VICOM project. However, the acquisition of context-related information through images is not a trivial task, especially with resource-constrained devices. To ease the recognition process, objects can be labeled with visual tags readable by machines. Once decoded, visual tags either directly provide information about the resource they are attached to or, if the amount of information is too large, they act as resource identifiers that can be used to gather information from the network. In this paper, we describe the design and the implementation of POLPO 1 (Polpo is On-demand Loading of Pervasive-Oriented applications), a software system that turns mass-market phones into a platform for the development of pervasive applications. With POLPO, a phone with a built-in camera and compatible with the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) platform is able to get context information by decoding visual tags attached to real-world objects. POLPO supports dynamic loading and installation of custom applications used to interact with the desired resources. 2 Background and contribution In this section we summarize the most relevant solutions based on visual tags and the contribution of our system in this field. Cybercode [4] is a visual tagging system based on a two-dimensional barcode technology. The system has been used to develop several augmented reality applications where the physical world is linked to the digital space trough the use of visual tags. Cybercode is one of the first systems where visual tags can be recognized by low-cost CCD or CMOS cameras, without the need for separate and dedicated readers. Each Cybercode symbol is able to encode 24 or 48 bits of information. The system has been tested with notebook PCs and PDAs. In [5] the author presents a system that turns camera-phones into mobile sensors for two-dimensional visual tags. By recognizing a visual tag, the device can determine the coded value, as well as additional parameters, such as the viewing angle of the camera. The system includes a movement detection scheme which enables to use the mobile phone as a mouse (this is achieved by associating a coordinate scheme to visual tags). The communication capability of the mobile phone is used to retrieve information related to the selected tag and to interact with the corresponding resource. Tag recognition and motion detection algorithms were implemented in C++ for Symbian OS. The Mobile Service Toolkit (MST) [6] is a client-server framework for developing site-specific services that interact with usersâ smart phones. Services are advertised by means of machine-readable visual tags, which encode the Bluetooth device address of the machine that hosts the service (Internet protocols addressing could be supported as well). Visual tags also include 15 bits of application-specific data. Once the connection has been established, MST servers can request personal information to the client to provide personalized services. Site-specific services can push user interfaces, expressed with a markup language similar to WML (Wireless Markup Language), to smart phones. MST also provide thin-client functionality: servers can push arbitrary graphics 1 The Italian name for the octopus vulgaris, a cephalopod of the order octopoda, probably the most intelligent of the invertebrates. to the phoneâs display which in turn forwards all keypress events to the server. The client-side is written in C++ and requires Symbian OS. A similar approach is described in [7], where the authors propose an architecture for a platform that supports ubiquitous services. Real-world objects are linked to services on the network through visual tags based on geometric invariants that do not depend on the viewing direction [8]. But differently from other solutions, image processing does not take place on the userâs device: pictures are sent to a server where they are elaborated and converted into IDs. Instead of using two-dimensional barcodes, an alternative way of performing object recognition is the one based on radio frequency identification (RFID): small tags, attached to or incorporated into objects, that respond to queries from a reader. However this solution, that can be useful in many pervasive computing scenarios, is not particularly suitable when the interaction is mediated by mobile phones, that lack the capability of reading RFIDs. In our opinion, currently available solutions present two major drawbacks: i) they are limited to specific hw/sw platforms (i.e. Symbian OS), excluding most of the models of mobile phones already shipped and in production in the near future; ii) the software needed to interact with the environment is statically installed onto the mobile phone and cannot be dynamically expanded, e.g. to interact with new classes of resources. We designed and developed a system for pervasive computing based on visual tags that overcomes these constraints as follows. Compatibility with J2ME The system runs on devices compatible with the J2ME platform. This environment is quite limited in terms of both memory and execution speed, but also extremely popular (nearly all mobile phones produced). This required the implementation of a pure Java decoder of visual tags for the J2ME environment. Downloadable applications Our system is based on the idea that the interaction with a given class of resources, e.g. printers, public displays, etc., takes place through a custom application. New custom applications can be downloaded from the network and installed onto the userâs device as needed. This brings two advantages: i) the classes of resources that can be used do not have to be known a priori; ii) the userâs device, that is resource constrained, includes only the software needed to interact with the services actually used. The J2ME platform comprises two configurations, few profiles, and several optional packages. The J2ME configurations identify different classes of devices: the Connected Device Configuration (CDC) is a framework that supports the execution of Java application on embedded devices such as network equipment, set-top boxes, and personal digital assistants; the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) defines the Java runtime for resource constrained devices as mobile phones and pagers. Our systems runs on top of the version 1.1 of the CLDC, that provides support for floating point arithmetics (unavailable in version 1.0). The adopted profile is the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) that, together with CLDC, provides a complete Java application environment for mobile phones. 3 System architecture POLPO requires that physical resources are labeled with visual tags, and that a program providing access to POLPO functionalities is installed onto the userâs device. This program has the following primary functions: â Decoding of visual tags. The image captured with the built-in camera is processed to extract the data contained into the visual tag. â Management of custom applications. The program downloads and installs the custom application required to interact with a resource. Usually, resources of the same kind share the same custom application (i.e., a single application is used to interact with all printers, another is used with public displays, etc). â Management of userâs personal data. In many cases, applications need information about the user to provide customized services. For this reason, the software installed on mobile phones includes a module that manages userâs personal data and stores them into the persistent memory. Managed data comprise userâs name, telephone number, email address, homepage, etc. Each resource is identified and described by a Data Matrix visual tag. Da",autonomous vehicle,18,not included

Looking at some extreme cases, you cannot use the same level of abstraction when simulating the evolution of the universe on a grand scale as when simulating protein folding. You can always trade execution time for increased detail or scope, but assuming you want a result in a reasonable time scale, compromises are necessary. A corollary to the abstraction rule is that simulation is a workload that can always use maximum computer performance (unless it is limited by the speed of interaction from the world or users). A faster computer or less detailed model lets you scale up the size of the system simulated or reduce simulation run times. In general, if the processor in your computer is not loaded to 100%, you are not making optimal use of simulation. The high demands for computer power used to be a limiting factor for the use of simulation, requiring large, expensive, and rare supercomputers to be used. Today, however, even the cheapest PC has sufficient computation power to perform relevant simulations in reasonable time. Thus, the availability of computer equipment is not a problem anymore, and simulation should be a tool considered for deployment to every engineer in a development project. Simulating the Environment Simulation of the physical environment is often done for its own sake, without regard for the eventual use of the simulation model by embedded software developers. It is standard practice in mechanical and electrical engineering to design with computer aided tools and simulation. For example, control engineers developing control algorithms for physical systems such as engines or processing plants often build models of the controlled system in tools such as MatLab/Simulink and Labview. These models are then combined with a model of the controller under development, and control properties like stability and performance evaluated. From a software perspective, this is simulating the specification of the embedded software along with the controlled environment. For a space probe, the environment simulation could comprise a model of the planets, the sun, and the probe itself. This model can be used to evaluate proposed trajectories, since it is possible to work through missions of years in length in a very short time. In conjunction with embedded computer simulations, such a simulator would provide data on the attitude and distance to the sun, the amount of power being generated from solar panels, and the positions of stars seen by the navigation sensors. When the mechanical component of an embedded system is potentially dangerous or impractical to work with, you absolutely want to simulate the effects of the software before committing to physical hardware. For example, control software for heavy machinery or military vehicles are best tested in simulation. Also, the number of physical prototypes available is fairly limited in such circumstances, and not something every developer will have at their desk. Such models can be created using modeling tools, or written in C or C++ (which is quite popular in practice). In many cases, environment simulations can be simple data sequences captured from a real sensor or simply guessed by a developer. It should be noted that a simulated environment can be used for two different purposes. One is to provide âtypicalâ data to the computer system simulation, trying to mimic the behavior of the final physical system under normal operating conditions. The other is to provide âextremeâ data, corresponding to boundary cases in the system behavior, and âfaultyâ data corresponding to broken sensors or similar cases outside normal operating conditions. The ability to inject extreme and faulty cases is a key benefit from simulation. Simulating the Human User Interface The human interface portion of an embedded device is often also simulated during its development. For testing user interface ideas, rapid prototyping and simulation is very worthwhile and can be done in many different ways. One creative example is how the creator of the original Palm Pilot used a wooden block to simulate the effect of carrying the device. Instead of building complete implementations of the interface of a TV, mobile phone, or plant control computer, mockups are built in specialized user interface (UI) tools, in Visual Studio GUI builder on a PC, or even PowerPoint or Flash. Sometimes such simulations have complex behaviors implemented in various scripts or even simple prototype software stacks. Only when the UI design is stable do you commit to implementing it in real code for your real device, since this typically implies a greater programming effort. In later phases of development, when the hardware user interface and most of the software user interface is done, a computer simulation of a device needs to provide input and output facilities to make it possible to test software for the device without hardware. This kind of simulation runs the gamut from simple text consoles showing the output from a serial port to graphical simulations of user interface panels where the user can click on switches, turn knobs, and watch feedback on graphical dials and screens. A typical example is Nokiaâs Series 60 development kit, which provides a virtual mobile phone with a keypad and small display. Another example is how virtual PC tools like VmWare and Parallels map the display, keyboard, and mouse of a PC to a target system. In consumer electronics, PC peripherals are often used to provide live test data approximating that of a real system. For example, a webcam is a good test data generator for a simulated mobile phone containing a camera. Even if the optics and sensors are different, it still provides something better than static predetermined images. Same for sound capture and playback â you want to hear the sound the machine is making, not just watch the waveform on a display. Simulating the Network Most embedded computers today are connected to one or more networks. These networks can be internal to a system; for example, in a rack-based system, VME, PCI, PCI Express, RapidIO, Ethernet, IC, serial lines, and ATM can be used to connect the boards. In cars, CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and MOST buses connect body electronics, telematics, and control systems. Aircraft control systems communicate over special bus systems like MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, and AFDX. Between the external interfaces of systems, Ethernet running internet standards like UDP and TCP is common. Mobile phones connect to headsets and PCs over Bluetooth, USB, and IR, and to cellular networks using UMTS, CDMA2000, GSM, and other standards. Telephone systems have traffic flowing using many different protocols and physical standards like SS7, SONET, SDH, and ATM. Smartcards connect to card readers using contacts or contact-less interfaces. Sensor nodes communicate over standard wireless networks or lower-power, lower-speed interfaces like Zigbee. Thus, existing in an internal or external network is a reality for most embedded systems. Due to the large scale of a typical network, the network part is almost universally simulated to some extent. You simply cannot test a phone switch or router inside its real deployment network, so you have to provide some kind of simulation for the external world. You donât want to test mobile phone viruses in the live network for very practical reasons. Often, many other nodes on the network are being developed at the same time. Or you might just want to combine point simulations of several networked systems into a single simulated network. Network simulation can be applied at many levels of the networking stack. The picture below shows the most common levels at which network simulation is being performed. The two levels highlighted in green are the ones that are most useful for embedded software work on a concrete target model. Physical signalling Bit stream Packet transmission Network protocol Application protocol High-level application actions Analog signals, bit errors, radio modeling Clocked zeros and ones, CAN with contention, Ethernet with CSMA model Ethernet packets with MAC address, CAN packets, serial characters, VME data read/write TCP/IP etc. FTP, DHCP, SS7, CANopen Load software, configure node, restart Hardware/software boundary r r / ft r r The most detailed modeling level is the physical signal level. Here, the analog properties of the transmission medium and how signals pass through it is modeled. This makes it possible to simulate radio propagation, echoes, and signal degradation, or the electronic interference caused by signals on a CAN bus. It is quite rarely used in the setting of developing embedded systems software, since it complex and provides more details than strictly needed. Bit stream simulation looks at the ones and zeroes transmitted on a bus or other medium. It is possible to detect events like transmission collisions on Ethernet and the resulting back-off, priorities being clocked onto a CAN bus, and signal garbling due to simultaneous transmissions in radio networks. An open example of such a simulator is the VMNet simulator for sensor networks. Considering the abstraction levels for computer system simulation discussed below, this is at an abstraction level similar to cycle-accurate simulation. Another example is the simulation of the precise clock-by-clock communication between units inside a system-on-a-chip. Packet transmission passes entire packets around, where the definition of a packet depends on the network type. In Ethernet, packets can be up to 65kB large, while serial lines usually transmit single bytes in each âpacketâ. It is the network simulation equivalent of transaction-level modeling, as discussed below for computer boards. The network simulation has no knowledge of the meaning of the packets. It just passes opaqu",autonomous vehicle,20,not included

Examples of such monitoring and detection include target tracking based on acoustic signatures and line-of-bearing estimation, climate control, intrusion detection, etc. The advances in low-power radio technology are making wireless communication within sensor networks an attractive option. However, it is typically difficult or impossible to replenish energy resources available to a portable sensor node, once it is deployed. Maximizing the life of sensor nodes is an overriding priority, and different energy optimization techniques are being developed to addresses computation/communication tradeoffs. A large number of research efforts are focusing on different aspects of the general problem of designing efficient sensor network-based systems where the metrics to measure efficiency vary from system to system. With technological advancements such as silicon-based radios expected to become a reality in a few years, designers of sensor network-based systems will be faced with an extremely large set of design decisions. Each choice will affect the overall system performance in ways that might not always be cleanly modeled. In addition to the research challenges in design and optimization, the practical aspects of designing real-world sensor networks will become equally important. For example, the ability of the design framework to allow rapid specification and evaluation of a particular network configuration is crucial for a more exhaustive exploration of the design space. A design environment for future sensor networks should provide tools and formal methodologies that will allow designers to model, analyze, optimize, and simulate such systems. In the context of our work, design and optimization of a sensor network application involves determining the task allocation to different sensor nodes and the inter-node communication mechanism. Design of the sensor node hardware itself is also an area of active research. However, we assume that a set of node architectures is already available to our enduser, and the design problem is restricted to using the available hardware (with flexibilities, if any, such as dynamic voltage scaling) to efficiently implement the target application. We take a simple, seven-node wireless sensor network for acoustic detection [5] (Automatic Target Recognition) as the case study and demonstrate (i) a modeling and simulation methodology for a class of sensor networks, and (ii) a software framework that implements our methodology. Our formal application model is illustrated in Fig. 1. We use a data flow graph representation to model the computing tasks and their data dependencies. The end-to-end application consists of two types of such data flow graphs: the first type denotes the processing that has to be performed for each sample before it is ready to be âfusedâ with results from other sensors, and the second type represents the computing involved in data fusion. Specifically , in our case study, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation is the only task that is performed on each block of sampled data. The outputs of FFTs from all seven nodes are provided as an input to the collaborative computing part, which consists of delay and sum beamforming (BF), and lineof-bearing (LOB) estimation. The result of collaborative computation in such a cluster model of sensor networks has to be transmitted to some observer. This is accomplished by designating one of the nodes as the cluster-head, which could be equipped with more powerful communication facilities than other sensor nodes. All communication within our cluster is one-hop, and processing of a particular data sample (FFT/BF/LOB) occurs either on its home node, or the cluster-head, or partly on both. Simulating a completely specified instance of the above class of sensor networks involves many challenges. None of the existing network simulators to our knowledge models the internal architecture of the processing nodes in the network. This is because the focus of most network simulators is on protocol development and empirical analysis. Except in areas such as high-speed router design, the node internals have little or no impact on decisions related to protocol design. Also, processor simulators do not model the environment outside the chip boundary. Therefore, to obtain detailed and accurate performance estimates for the entire system, we propose a technique to automatically generate network scenarios based on results from low-level node simulations. The network simulator is configured using the generated scenarios, and the individual simulation results are merged and presented to the end-user as a whole. Such a âhorizontalâ simulation is accomplished through the use of a central data repository for model information, which means that the simulators never have to directly interact with each other. The simulators we integrate provide estimates about energy consumption, thereby assisting in a power/performance analysis of a specific system configuration. Our design framework facilitates multi-granular simulation, i.e., simulating the same system configuration by using simulation models at different levels of abstraction. Typically, coarse-grained models provide rapid estimates, but need to make approximations about system behavior that might not be very accurate. For such a scenario, we demonstrate a form of analytical model refinement (see Fig. 2), i.e. the data from low-level simulations can be automatically processed to âdistillâ parameter values used by high-level simulators. Naturally, the exact processing has to be specified by someone with knowledge of the analytical model semantics. Our design environment provides the following capabilities to the user: â¢ To graphically describe the target application, node architecture, network configuration, and task-to-node mapping. â¢ To change (reconfigure) the system model to explore alternate designs. Some of the parameters that can be manipulated by the designer include receive/transmit power of the radio, voltage/frequency setting of the processor, cluster geometry, propagation models, etc. â¢ To automatically simulate a design using a coarse system model. â¢ To automatically configure and execute low-level simulators for the node (Wattch [3]) and the network (ns-2 [4]) and obtain system-wide energy and latency estimates. â¢ To automatically update high-level model parameters using low-level simulation statistics. â¢ To graphically visualize simulation results and facilitate (manual) identification of power/performance bottlenecks in the design. This work is an illustration of the general approach of the MILAN [1] project. A modeling and simulation framework based on the first version of the 7-node ATR system model was implemented in [2]. The primary focus of that work was a prototype demonstration of simulator integration and model refinement. Therefore, the system model itself lacked generality. Also, we use a relatively more detailed version of the high-level estimator implemented for [2]. This work represents a significant step towards the ultimate goal of a design environment for automatic optimization and synthesis of sensor network applications.",autonomous vehicle,21,not included

The main advantages are dynamic modelling and visual interpretation of the traffic conditions. This tool is ideal to test geometric designs, traffic controls and a variety of traffic management measures. These include incident and congestion management, road works, ramp metering, VMS, etc. It is an extremely suitable tool to use when low cost solutions must be found because of severely limited infrastructure resources. Times that micro simulation was not able to calculate and show reliable traffic situations is over, various traffic simulation models have developed and have reached high quality standards. Micro simulation is about to gain a real market share all around the world; South Africa is following. Modelling toll plazas at interchanges on the N4 Platinum Toll Road is used to illustrate the advantages of micro simulation. Geometric design options, measures effecting toll throughput and traffic control options were evaluated in this example as well as the estimation of the expected life span of various options within a congested network. The package used in this study is AIMSUN2, an advanced micro simulation package widely used internationally that can interact with TRANSYT, SCOOT, EMME/2 and SATURN. AIMSUN2 has been applied to traffic impact analysis, traffic control measures, HOV-lanes, tolling and geometric design within the last three years in South Africa. It has also been used successfully to convey results of investigations to nontechnical people. 1. MICRO SIMULATION 1.1 Background on the development of micro simulation The microscopic traffic simulation models are based on the reproduction of the traffic flows simulating the behavior of the individual vehicles, this not only enables them to capture the full dynamics of time dependent traffic phenomena, but also to deal with behavioral models accounting for driversâ reactions. The underlying hypothesis is that the dynamics of a stream of traffic is the result of a series of driversâ attempts to regulate their speed and acceleration accordingly with information received. The driverâs actions resulting from the interpretation of the information received will consist on the control of the acceleration (braking and accelerating), the control of heading (steering) and the decision of overtaking the precedent vehicle either to increase the speed or to position themselves in the right lane to perform a maneuver (i.e. a turning). The origins of microscopic traffic simulation can be traced back to the early stages of digital computers. Although the basic principles were set up many years ago, with the seminal work of, among others, Robert Hermann and the General Motors Group in the early fifties, the computing requirements made them impractical until hardware and software developments made them affordable even on todayâs laptop computers. Most of the currently existing microscopic traffic simulators are based on the family of carfollowing, lane changing and gap acceptance models to model the vehicleâs behavior. Carfollowing models are a form of stimulus-response model, where the response is the reaction of the driver (follower) to the motion of the vehicle immediately preceding him (the leader) in the traffic stream. The response of the follower is to accelerate or decelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the stimulus at time t after a reaction time T. The generic form of the conceptual model is: response (t+T) = sensitivity * stimulus (t) Among the most used models are Hellyâs model (1), implemented in SITRA-B+, (2), Hermanâs model (3), or its improved version by Wicks (4), implemented in MITSIM, (5), the psycho-physical model of Wiedemann, (6), used in VISSIM (7), or the ad hoc version of Gipps (8), used in AIMSUN2 (9, 10). Other microscopic simulators such as INTEGRATION (11) and PARAMICS employ heuristic or other modeling not publicly available in analytic form. A common drawback of most of these models is that the model parameters are global i.e. constant for the entire network whereas it is well know that driverâs behavior is affected by traffic conditions. Therefore a more realistic car-following modeling for microscopic simulation should account for local behavior. This implies that some of the model parameters must be local depending on local geometric and traffic conditions. 1.2 What micro simulation is and the advantages thereof compared to static models The deployment of Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) requires support of complementary studies clearly showing the feasibility of the systems and what benefits should be expected from their operation. The large investments required have to be justified in a robust way. That means feasibility studies that validate the proposed systems, assess their expected impacts and provide the basis for sound cost benefit analyses. Microscopic traffic simulation has proven to be a useful tool to achieve these objectives. This is not only due to its ability to capture the full dynamics of time dependent traffic phenomena, but also being capable of dealing with behavioral models accounting for driversâ reactions when exposed to ITS systems. The advent of ITS has created new objectives and requirements for micro-simulation models. Quoting from Deliverable D3 of the European Commission Project SMARTEST [12]: âThe objective of micro-simulation models is essentially, from the model designers point of view, to quantify the benefits of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), primarily Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) and Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS). Micro-simulation is used for evaluation prior to or in parallel with on-street operation. This covers many objectives such as the study of dynamic traffic control, incident management schemes, real-time route guidance strategies, adaptive intersection signal controls, ramp and mainline metering, etc. Furthermore some models try to assess the impact and sensitivity of alternative design parametersâ. The analysis of traffic systems and namely ITS systems, is beyond the capabilities of traditional static transport planning models. Microscopic simulation is then the suitable analysis tool to achieve the required objectives. An example from a real case study where microscopic simulation was used to complement static modeling will help us to understand better how both levels may help the decisionmaker. The city of San Sebastian, in the North of Spain, completed recently a new urban freeway connecting two separated neighborhoods. Figure 1 shows the typical result of the planning study with an close up of the Amara neighborhood. The road network and the demand were modeled using the EMME/2 package. The figure displays the expected impacts of the new infrastructure highlighting in green the average flow reduction due to the redistribution of flows enabled by the new paths on the network, and in red the increase of flows attracted by these paths. A significant discharge in the level of congestion in the main road network was the foreseen impact of the new infrastructure, but the access to the new freeway in the East-West direction shows some undesirable side effects in the neighborhood (Amara) inside the rectangle. The solutions to these problems demands a close up to the subnetwork and take decisions at the level of traffic control and traffic management schemes, not excluding even a partial reshaping of part of the street network. This type of decision requires a more detailed modeling, able of reproducing in a very accurate way the traffic conditions, accounting for the interactions between the vehicular flows and the infrastructure, and obviously including the influence of the traffic lights, objective that can only be achieved by a microscopic traffic simulation model. Figure 1: Expected impact of the new infrastructure in San Sebastian with an close up of the Amara neighborhood Figure 2 displays the corresponding model built with the AIMSUN2 traffic simulation software, the EMME/2 sub model has been built automatically from the AIMSUN2 model by means of an interface between both systems. Figure 2: AIMSUN2 micro simulation model of the Amara neighborhood The type of information that micro simulation can provide for a further analysis is beyond the capabilities of traditional static models. The average flows from sections to sections turning movements) for the allowed movements at selected intersections in the model, speeds and delays for every simulated time interval can be obtained. The dynamic analysis for a time period is completed with values for other traffic variables or indicators of the quality of service as number of stops, time delayed at stops, average queue lengths, etc. Figure 3 provide a further insight on the capacity of analysis provided by dynamic simulation software. The graphic in this figure describes the evolution over time of average flows. The same type of graph can be produced for average queue lengths on a subset of selected sections in the model. Figure 3: The evolution of average flows over time 1.3 The ease of model building and data input (AIMSUN2) The recent evolution of the microscopic simulators has taken advantages of the state-of-theart in the development of object-oriented simulators, and graphical user interfaces, as well as the new trends in software design and the available tools that support it adapted to traffic modeling requirements. A proper achievement of the basic requirements of a microscopic simulator implies building models as close to reality as possible. The closer the model is to reality the more data demanding it become. This has been traditionally the main barrier Section Volumes (Veh/h) 0 200 400 600 80",autonomous vehicle,22,not included

Digitally enhanced guides have many advantages over traditional paper-based indoor guides, most of all that they can be aware of their current context and display dynamic information. That is why particularly shopping malls recently started deploying indoor assistance applications for mobile phones, which also include support for navigation. Moreover, as we show in the paper, projected interfaces offer additional distinct advantages over static guides and even traditional or augmented reality mobile applications. We describe five concepts for a shopping mall indoor assistance system based on projector phones, comprising support for shop selection, precise way finding, âvirtual fittingâ of clothes, and context-aware and ambient advertisements. We then apply the concepts to a typical shopping scenario, where users wear the phone at their belt and constantly project the interface in front of them. Expected benefits of our system are that people find their way quicker, easier, and less distracted from their usual shopping experience. Finally, we discuss the technical feasibility of our envisioned implementation and research questions we are particularly interested in. INTRODUCTION Navigation and location-based services for pedestrians recently gained a lot of attention and are becoming rapidly adopted. Very popular among these are applications for location-based places recommendations and turn-by-turn navigation. While these applications mostly focus on outdoor navigation, less attention has been paid to the opportunities for providing indoor assistance with mobile devices. Especially in large complex buildings, e.g. shopping centers, in most cases static signs, You-Are-Here maps, or paper flyer maps are still the only available navigation assistance for visitors. Preliminary observations and interviews we conducted in nearby shopping centers show that, at least in Germany, available navigational aids are still as insufficient as Levine reported them to be almost 30 years ago [8]. Despite a lot of research projects that explored indoor assistance over the last decade, it was not before the beginning of 2011 that we saw the first mobile shopping applications reaching consumer markets, such as the Samâs Club mobile application [1], which provides indoor navigation to specific items and/or shops in some selected American shopping malls. Similarly, some shopping centers in Asia introduced mobile AR applications for shopping assistance [2]. In our research group we study future application areas of projector phones, i.e. mobile phones with integrated projectors (see [11] for a detailed survey). We found projector phones to provide some distinguished advantages for indoor navigation assistance, e.g., that interaction can be handsfree and the projection can serve as ambient display, thereby not contradicting the traditional shopping experience. Further that the surrounding world can be directly augmented, freeing the user from mapping between mobile display and real world and that the output space is much larger than on mobile displays. And finally, that bystander can see and attach to the projected output. RELATED WORK We present relevant work dealing with mobile shopping, recommender systems, indoor positioning and navigation. One of the first works on digital mobile shopping assistants has been done by Asthana et al. [3]. They presented main usage scenarios, e.g., telling people where to find certain products or informing them on discounts and special offers. Similar can be recognized in aforementioned mobile shopping applications and as well in recently filed patents, e.g. from Apple Inc. (US 2010/0198626 A1, US 2010/0191578 A1), which include navigation, service interactions (e.g., parking tickets), and support for social networking. Yang et al. [15] developed a location-aware recommender system. It learns a customerâs interests from previously visited product websites and continuously presents a list of products around the customerâs current location, that are likely to interest him. The software also takes into account the distance to shops and is able to learn customerâs preference between highly interesting products and far distances. Butz et al. [4] present a hybrid indoor navigation system that is able to adapt route instructions to different output devices (screen resolution, device resources) and based on the precision of available location information. Results from [7,14] indicate that intelligent fusion of infrastructure techniques, e.g. GPS, GSM triangulation, and sensors like accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, enables precise indoor location tracking with current commercially available smartphones in unaltered environments. Kray et al. [6] explore the design space of routing instructions for pedestrians on mobile devices. Narzt et al. present a specific mobile application for augmented reality (AR) [10]. Alternative systems for pedestrian navigation are the Rotating Compass by Rukzio et al. [12], showing personalised navigation information on public displays and the CabBoots system by Frey [5], which guides users by means of tactile output in the shoes. Aforementioned techniques, with the exception of the last two, rely on holding a handset device. However, we feel strongly inclined that holding a device in hand for a longer time does not fit well the traditional shopping experience. Negative side effects, e.g., arm fatigue, regular switching of the field of view, do not allow using the shopping assistance application as constant companion. CONCEPT In our envisioned prototype, people wear their projector phone on their belt, projecting a display right in front of their feet (Figure 1). In the following we present five concepts for mobile shopping assistance that are enabled by projector phones. Later we apply these concepts to a typical shopping scenario. Shadow Interaction Since our concept expects people to wear the projector fixed to the belt most of the time, direct interaction with the mobile device would not be sufficient as the only interaction technique. Audio is not an alternative because of the noisy environment in a shopping mall. This leaves users with the option to directly interact with the projection, either by feet or hands (or gaze in the future). In preliminary studies we discovered that foot-based interaction is not well suited due to the fact that foot movement inherently involves movement of the body at the same time, which makes interaction cumbersome. We found interacting with the shadow of a finger in front of the projection a much more promising solution. Figure 2 shows the stroke of the resulting shadow on the projection. With the tip of the shadow, all points on the projection can be reached. Items should be highlighted once the shadow reaches their bounding box to give adequate feedback to the user. Although the tracking of the fingerâs height to enable traditional press/release behaviors would be possible, this would require the user to maintain a complex mental model of different finger height levels. Instead, our concept builds on the fact, that the tip of the index finger can be moved well without changing the shape of the rest of the hand or even the middle knuckle of the index finger. Thus, to select an item, a user moves the index finger to point on the desired item and then bends the index finger and unbends it again. Alternatively, one could use the fingerâs dwell time as in Microsoftâs Kinect. To the best of our knowledge, shadow interaction with projections has not been reported before. Radar of Recommendations Another concept that is particularly useful with projected navigation is a radar of recommendations. Building on [15], we want to constantly show and update a personal radar of products the user might be interested in (Figure 2). Based on the information available from accounts with online stores (e.g., Amazon) and items recently explored with our system (see fourth concept), users see offers of nearby stores in front of them and can select these items to start a navigation in the middle of the circle. The size of an item conveys the expected interest of the user, the distance from the middle depicts the walking distance (not air path) from the userâs current location. The size of the radius of interest (distance to shops and items) can be adjusted by slightly changing the angle of the projector, similarly to looking further ahead. Different from [15], the projection provides a much larger output space and the radar serves as ambient display in the userâs periphery. Projected (augmented) Navigation When the user selected an item or shop he is interested in, the assistance system starts a projected navigation. In outdoor navigation, turn-by-turn navigation is still the most prominent, though we have seen augmented reality been used in research [10]. Especially for indoor navigation, where there are more tight and subsequent turns or small decision spaces (take the left stairs up, not the right stairs down) our experience is that turn-by-turn navigation does not work well. Therefore, we want the user not to follow Figure 1: The projector is worn at different locations on the belt (left and middle) and can optionally be taken into hand to change the angle of the projection (right). Figure 2: The user interacts with his radar of recommendations through the shadow of his finger. The orange outline shows the shadow, the left red circle the fingertip that, for clicking, can be changed independently of the fingerâs middle knuckle (right circle) or the rest of the handâs shape. this type of directions, but instead simply follow a blue line projected in front of her (see Figure 3). Since the projector phone is spatially-aware, both in terms of location and orientation, the blue line is projected as a static augmentation of the real world, i",autonomous vehicle,24,not included

The functionality of a peer is implemented by a P2P application which de nes the behavior of the whole P2P system. The equivalence of peers is realized by providing client functionality as well as server functionality. Implementing a P2P system with speci ed behavior is a di cult task because the behavior depends on many factors, such as the used P2P search methods and the underlying physical network. Some factors cannot be taken into account completely because of their complexity or unknown or not understood parts. For instance, the prospective user behavior may only be estimated based on observed data. When engineering complex, dynamic software systems such as P2P systems, simulation is often used to analyze the properties of these systems based on simulation models in an early development phase. With simulations in natural sciences, the separation of reality and (simulation) model is clear: the reality exists in nature, while the model exists as software within some computer system. When simulating software systems, this separation is not so obvious: the simulated model is itself a software system. With P2P systems, for instance, a simpli ed P2P system is modeled and simulated for predicting properties of real P2P systems. The new software engineering contribution of this work is the Peer Software Engineering (PeerSE) method, which allows a controlled transition from simulation models to real-world software systems. The method starts with a comparative analysis of simulation models for P2P systems and proceeds iteratively toward the experimental implementation in a laboratory setting and nally a real-world P2P system deployed in a target environment. The method includes a simulation model for P2P systems and a tool supporting the execution of simulation and laboratory experiments. Simulation is an essential part of the PeerSE method used to identify and to compare models ful lling given requirements. When an appropriate model has been found, model components can be reused and further re ned to implement a laboratory P2P system. To allow for a controlled transition of model components to laboratory components, the results of simulation and laboratory experiments are directly compared using the same metrics. The applicability of the PeerSE method has been successfully evaluated by analyzing and realizing a P2P system for distributed software development.",autonomous vehicle,25,not included

Augmented reality head-mounted displays, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, make it possible to view 3-D data overlaid on the real world. This allows a user to view and interact with the data in ways similar to how they would interact with a physical 3-D object, such as moving, rotating, or walking around it. A type of 3-D data that is particularly useful for military applications is geo-specific 3-D terrain data, and the visualization of this data is critical for training, mission planning, intelligence, and improved situational awareness. Advances in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), photogrammetry software, and rendering hardware have drastically reduced the technological and financial obstacles in collecting aerial imagery and in generating 3-D terrain maps from that imagery. Because of this, there is an increased need to develop new tools for the exploitation of 3-D data. We will demonstrate how the HoloLens can be used as a tool for visualizing 3-D terrain data. We will describe: 1) how UAScollected imagery is used to create 3-D terrain maps, 2) how those maps are deployed to the HoloLens, 3) how a user can view and manipulate the maps, and 4) how multiple users can view the same virtual 3-D object at the same time.",autonomous vehicle,26,not included

This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.
               
                  Methods
                  Medical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.
               
                  Results
                  Twenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p
                     =0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p
                     =0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p

                     =0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p
                     =0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p
                     =0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p
                     =0.49) and NOTSS (p
                     >0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.

                  Part- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention.

AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms.

In these cases, emphasis has been placed on employing already-proven computing software which was modifed to take advantage of vector processing and other forms of parallel operations. This trend is expected to continue because the established usage base of commercially available programs is not likely to be quickly dislodged. The near term will see the further use of design optimization, broader use of nonlinear mechanics, and a closer link between designers and analysts because of improved computer turnaround. The economy of scale suggests that solution techniques will be performed not only faster but cheaper than is possible with scalar processors which will further encourage the analysis of larger, more complex structures. The supercomputers of the future are expected to offer additional challenges to today's application systems. A primary factor in this will be the effective use of multiprocessors. Additional influence is expected as Artificial Intelligence matures to the point where Expert Systems become a reality for selected engineering and scientific disciplines.

By removing the burden of generating annotated data from humans, we make the deep learning technique applied to computer vision, which typically requires very large data sets, truly automated and reliable. With the ARS pipeline, we created two novel data sets effortlessly, one on electromechanical components (industrial scenario) and other on fruits (daily-living scenario) and trained two state-of-the-art object detectors robustly, based on convolutional neural networks, such as you only look once (YOLO) and single shot detector (SSD). With respect to conventional manual annotation of 1000 frames that takes us slightly more than 10 h, the proposed approach based on ARS allows to annotate 9 sequences of about 35 000 frames in less than 1 h, with a gain factor of about 450. Moreover, both the precision and recall of object detection is increased by about 15% with respect to manual labeling.

Specifically, a deep learning robot guidance vision system would require such a large amount of manually labeled images that it would be too expensive and impractical for a real use case, where system reconfigurability is a fundamental requirement. With our system, on the other hand, especially in the field of industrial robotics, the cost of image labeling can be reduced, for the first time, to nearly zero, thus paving the way for self-reconfiguring systems with very high performance (as demonstrated by our experimental results). One of the limitations of this approach is the need to use a manual method for the detection of objects of interest in the preliminary stages of the pipeline (ARP or graphical interface).

The project has been conducted in the Servinform context, a Spanish consultancy firm, and the proposed prototype has been validated with reality settings. The initial experiences yield promising results in reducing AHT (Average Handle Time) in processes where AIRPA deployed cognitive robots, which encourages exploring the support of intelligent RPA development.",industry,41,included

Robotic Process Automation (RPA), especially as one of the elements of the Lean
approach. The full implementation of RPA is riddled with challenges relating
both to the reality of everyday business operations, from SMEs to SSCs and
beyond, and the social effects of the changing job market. To successfully
address these points there is a need to develop a solution that would adjust to
the existing business operations and at the same time lower the negative social
impact of the automation process.
  To achieve these goals we propose a hybrid, human-centered approach to the
development of software robots. This design and implementation method combines
the Living Lab approach with empowerment through participatory design to
kick-start the co-development and co-maintenance of hybrid software robots
which, supported by variety of AI methods and tools, including interactive and
collaborative ML in the cloud, transform menial job posts into higher-skilled
positions, allowing former employees to stay on as robot co-designers and

respect to the conventional manual annotation of 1000 frames that takes us
slightly more than 10 hours, the proposed approach based on ARS allows
annotating 9 sequences of about 35000 frames in less than one hour, with a gain

In the era of industry 4.0, most universities have implemented digital libraries in supporting the learning process. However, the reality shows that digital library management is still ineffective. Therefore, the implementation of digital libraries needs to be evaluated for determining the digital library effectiveness used as learning resources in supporting the learning process in universities. Many evaluation tools are used to evaluate the effectiveness of digital libraries but have not provided accurate recommendation results to support decision-making. This research presents an innovation in the form of an evaluation tool that can be used to evaluate the digital library effectiveness in universities. That evaluation tool is called the Alkin-WP-based digital library evaluation software. This software is a desktop platform that contains aspects of measuring the digital library effectiveness by referring to the components of the Alkin evaluation model and the WP (Weighted Product) method. This research aimed to show the effectiveness level of the utilization of Alkin-WP-based digital library evaluation software. This research method was R & D (Research & Development) which refers to the ten development stages of the Borg and Gall model. In this research, development was focused only on a few stages, included: usage trials, final product revision, dissemination, and implementation. The subjects involved in assessing the implementation/utilization of the Alkin-WP-based digital library evaluation software were 35 people, in the usage trials were six people, in product revision were three people, and at the stage of dissemination were 15 people. The tools used to collect data were questionnaires and interview guidelines. The data analysis technique used was descriptive quantitative. The effectiveness level of utilizing the Alkin-WP-based digital library evaluation software was 88.34%. It showed that the evaluation software had effective. The impact of this research results on the scientific field of educational evaluation is being able to show the existence of a new evaluation tool based on educational evaluation and artificial intelligence.

Concept of Automated Vehicle in the era of the fourth industrial revolution is transforming from the `vehicle` that had its focal point in the hardware to the `portable computer` that has its focus in the software that processes broad range of digital information. The phenomenon in one aspect is innovation through scientific technology. However on the other hand, it is raising humanistic, philosophical and legal questions about how human life will change according to the technological and industrial transition. Age of `Artificial Intelligence` and `Posthuman` emerging through the development of technology is creating new concept of human and bringing forward the issue of new danger that is occurring when reason and physical abilities thought as the essence of `human` is being substituted by scientific technology and computer. The advocates of automated vehicle assert that it provides more safety and convenience to human. Such argument cannot be completely be false, and I wish to reach the same conclusion eventually. However, as other process of introducing new technology like nuclear energy tell us, to consider whether automated vehicle is more convenient and better than the previous vehicle system and whether there are no new danger that new technology is bringing about or overlooked elements of danger is severely important. Therefore, if certain danger is expected, technological prevention should be devised as a first step, and for the sections where technology and industry is not self-regulating, it is legislations and policies` role to lead and force to a human-friendly direction. Automated vehicle that is being discussed nowadays can be neutral itself and seem to be no more than a convenient device. However, since each automated vehicle is activated by entering massive amount of digital information and since it collects, stores, and distributes a welter of personal information when connected to Internet of Things(IoT), whole new danger from the previous era is created in terms of personal information and privacy. The ironic reality of surveillance society since the modern times that has assured freedom of an individual on the one hand and has reinforced utilitarian society control on the grounds of fully protecting one`s right and expanding welfare on the other lies beneath this near future. Especially, personal information is more being exposed and distributed and collection and surveillance of digital information is becoming easier in the information age. Automated vehicle system cannot be free from such exposure and danger of violating since it is operated with geolocation, video, and communication information as well. Moreover, since violation of personal information can lead to violation of privacy and human dignity, and damage the basic order of liberal democracy, arranging the frame of public regulation relating to personal information protection by researching U.S. and European Union legislation and seems more than necessary. Being awake is what sovereign needs in the digital era. Likewise, to secure right to personal information, we should remember to turn the monitoring lamp on in advance not only as an individual, but also as a group in order to obtain convenience and prevent danger of new era of automated vehicle.??? ????????? ??????????????? ?????????????????????????????? ???????????????(HY-2014??????)",industry,47,not included

This is creating a new world of entirely new business models in which conventional development methods are reaching their limits. A vehicle exists both as a physical object in the real world and as a digital model, or âdigital twinâ, each of which is closely synchronized with the other. Development and operations cycles are increasingly merging in a way that would be impossible without virtualization and modern development approaches such as continuous deployment. Bosch and its subsidiary ETAS are shaping this new world. They offer a Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) suite that links the various elements of virtualization to the required development tools in a modular and flexible manner. Coordinated interactions between the key elements of the SiL framework ensure the quality and usability of the virtual world elements.

First, robots provide many possible points of system failure, while the availability of human participants is limited. Second, for tasks such as language learning, it is important to create environments that provide interesting' varied use cases. Traditionally, this requires prepared physical spaces for each scenario being studied. Finally, the expense associated with acquiring robots and preparing spaces places serious limitations on the reproducible quality of experiments. We therefore propose a novel mechanism for using virtual reality to simulate robotic sensor data in a series of prepared scenarios. This allows for a reproducible dataset that other labs can recreate using commodity VR hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with an implementation that includes a simulated physical context, a reconstruction of a human actor, and a reconstruction of a robot.

A noticeable recent trend in visual SLAM is to apply computationand memory-intensive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that outperform traditional hand-designed feature-based methods [1]. For each video frame, CNN-extracted features are matched with stored keypoints to estimate the agent's 6-DoF pose by solving a perspective-n-points (PnP) non-linear optimization problem (Fig. 7.3.1, left). The agent's long-term trajectory over multiple frames is refined by a bundle adjustment process (BA, Fig. 7.3.1 right), which involves a large-scale (~120 variables) non-linear optimization.

Because of the diversity of the sub-tasks, the layers within and across the DNN models are highly heterogeneous in operation and shape. Diverse layer operations and shapes are major challenges for a fixed dataflow accelerator (FDA) that employs a fixed dataflow strategy on a single DNN accelerator substrate since each layer prefers different dataflows (computation order and parallelization) and tile sizes. Reconfigurable DNN accelerators (RDAs) have been proposed to adapt their dataflows to diverse layers to address the challenge. However, the dataflow flexibility in RDAs is enabled at the cost of expensive hardware structures (switches, interconnects, controller, etc.) and requires per-layer reconfiguration, which introduces considerable energy costs. Alternatively, this work proposes a new class of accelerators, heterogeneous dataflow accelerators (HDAs), which deploy multiple accelerator substrates (i.e., sub-accelerators), each supporting a different dataflow. HDAs enable coarser-grained dataflow flexibility than RDAs with higher energy efficiency and lower area cost comparable to FDAs. To exploit such benefits, hardware resource partitioning across sub-accelerators and layer execution schedule need to be carefully optimized. Therefore, we also present Herald, a framework for co-optimizing hardware partitioning and layer scheduling. Using Herald on a suite of AR/VR and MLPerf workloads, we identify a promising HDA architecture, Maelstrom, which demonstrates 65.3% lower latency and 5.0% lower energy compared to the best fixed dataflow accelerators and 22.0% lower energy at the cost of 20.7% higher latency compared to a state-of-the-art reconfigurable DNN accelerator (RDA).

We made use of customized photorealistic avatars for the implementation of both the high-end version (based on Facebook's Oculus) and the low-end version (based on Google's cardboard) of our platform. Under the Selfattachment therapeutic framework, the causes of mental disorders such as chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the individual's insecure attachment with their primary caregiver during childhood and their subsequent problems in affect regulation. The conventional approach (without VR) to Selfattachment requires that the individual uses their childhood photographs to recall their childhood memories and then imagine that the child that they were is present with them. They thus establish a compassionate relationship with their childhood self and then, using love songs and dancing, create an affectional bond with them. Their adult self subsequently role plays a good parent and interacts with their imagined childhood self to perform various developmental and re-parenting activities. The goal is to enhance their capacities for self-regulation of emotion, which can lead them into earning secure attachment. It is hypothesized that our immersive virtual reality platform - which enables the users to interact with their customized 3D photorealistic childhood avatar - offers either a better alternative or at least a complementary visual tool to the conventional imaginal approach to Self-attachment. The platform was developed in Unity 3D, a cross-platform game engine, and takes advantage of the itSeez3D Avatar SDK for generating a customized photorealistic 3D avatar head from a 2D childhood image of the user. The platform also offers facial and body animations for some of the basic emotional states such as Happy, Sad, Scared and Joyful and it allows modifications to the avatar body (height/ width) and clothing color. A study to compare the use of the avatar-based approach (VR) to Self-attachment with the conventional photo-based approach showed promising results.

Our work is based on a recent proposed deep learning model, pix2pix, that can successfully transform an image from one domain into another domain, such as from line drawings to color images. However, the pix2pix model relies on the condition that input images should come from the same distribution, which is usually hard for applying it to real human computer interaction tasks, where the input from users differs from individual to individual. To address the problem, we propose a compensation method of two-stage image generation. In the first stage, we ask users to indicate their design preference with an easy task, such as tuning clothing landmarks, and use the input to generate a compensation input. With the compensation input, in the second stage, we then concatenate it with the real sketch from users to generate a perceptual better result.

to ambulate. Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI)
controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like
ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested
a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control
of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).
  Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following
10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking
kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed
to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a
goal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the
KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops
at designated points within the VRE.
  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was
77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),
with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 +/-

of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions.
  Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode
users' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced

Instead, following the principle of synergy leads to the conviction that there is always a certain model of optimal complexity e.g. in the synthesis of the new system, and in the analysis of real system peculiarities. However, the model of reality could be a part of this reality that is included to the carefully structured formal description.  Since we cannot penetrate into the working space of the serial engine while testing, we should use a test engine of a special construction when the working space corresponds to the laws of similarity and this engine will serve as a model of the working space of the serial engine.

The study illustrates the effectiveness of hard-soft technology while investigating the peculiarities of heat generation and heat consumption in the internal combustion engine, which will combine mathematic and algorithmic means of modelling as well as the means of real simulation. The necessity of hard-soft technology introduction arises from the excessive complexity of thermal phenomena occurring in the internal combustion engine (ICE), and the inability to fully subordinate these phenomena to existing analytical models.
The combination of original and analytical properties, reality and virtual reality while modelling the processes in internal combustion engines allows us to substantially improve the quality of information in the process of design and engine construction. Taking this into consideration, there are some natural grounds to apply principles of heuristic self-organization, self-learning, means of the neural networks, etc. in the design implementation.
The study demonstrates the example of modelling the real working space of ICE with the forced start that serves as a supplement to the mathematical algorithmic two-zone model of heat generation / heat consumption / heat extraction.
The basic information that can be obtained by means of hard-soft technology in the framework of, for example, the two-zone model of the work process in the gasoline engine, is the variability with the change in the angle of rotation of the crankshaft of the engine: absolute pressure (indicative diagram); absolute temperature; heat transmitted inside the cylinder between zones; coefficient of excess air; coefficient of heat transfer; intensity of heat extraction in the process of combustion of fuel; intensity of heat transfer through the walls of the cylindeÐÐµÑÐµÑÐ¼ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÐ¸ÑÐ½Ðµ Ñ Ð² Ð¿ÐµÐ²Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ñ ÑÐµÐ½ÑÑ Â«Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÐ¹Ð½ÐµÂ» ÑÑÐ°ÐºÑÑÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ ÑÐ²ÑÑÑ ÑÐ°ÑÑÐ¾ Ð²ÐµÐ´Ðµ Ð´Ð¾ Ð²Ð¸Ð·Ð½Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð³Ð¾, ÑÐ¾ ÑÐ¸Ð¼ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ½ÑÑÐ¾Ñ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÐ±Ð½Ð° Ð¹Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¼Ð¾Ð´ÐµÐ»Ñ, ÑÐ¸Ð¼ ÑÐºÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð½ÑÑÐ¾Ñ Ð²Ð¾Ð½Ð° Ð¼Ð°Ñ Ð±ÑÑÐ¸ (ÑÐº Ñ ÑÐ°Ð·Ñ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð°Ð»ÑÐ·Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð²ÑÐ´ÑÐ²Ð¾ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ñ ÑÐµÐ°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð¾Ñ ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐµÐ¼Ð¸, ÑÐ°Ðº Ñ Ñ ÑÐ°Ð·Ñ Ð²ÑÑÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð½Ñ Ð±Ð°Ð¶Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐµÐ¼Ð½Ð¸Ñ Ð²Ð»Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð²Ð¾ÑÑÐµÐ¹ Ñ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÑÑ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð°Ð»ÑÐ·Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ ÑÐ¸Ð½ÑÐµÐ·Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ÑÑ Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ð³Ð¾).

Procedural methods like finite-state transducers and augmented transition networks have proven to be beneficial to implement semantic fusion. They are compliant with rapid development cycles that are common for the development of user interfaces, in contrast to machine-learning approaches that require time-costly training and optimization. We identify seven fundamental requirements for the implementation of semantic fusion: Action derivation, continuous feedback, context-sensitivity, temporal relation support, access to the interaction context, as well as the support of chronologically unsorted and probabilistic input. A subsequent analysis reveals, however, that there is currently no solution for fulfilling the latter two requirements. As the main contribution of this article, we thus present the Concurrent Cursor concept to compensate these shortcomings. In addition, we showcase a reference implementation, the Concurrent Augmented Transition Network (cATN), that validates the conceptâs feasibility in a series of proof of concept demonstrations as well as through a comparative benchmark. The cATN fulfills all identified requirements and fills the lack amongst previous solutions. It supports the rapid prototyping of multimodal interfaces by means of five concrete traits: Its declarative nature, the recursiveness of the underlying transition network, the network abstraction constructs of its description language, the utilized semantic queries, and an abstraction layer for lexical information. Our reference implementation was and is used in various student projects, theses, as well as master-level courses. It is openly available and showcases that non-experts can effectively implement multimodal interfaces, even for non-trivial applications in mixed and virtual reality",multimedia,105,not included

Although protected by law, in the last two decades Italian in schools has suffered a number of attacks that highlighted the need for specific language policies and relative pedagogical implementation.

This project is located in the latter sphere of action and aims to fill a gap in the landscape of educational offers for teaching Italian in Switzerland. Following the paradigm of âgestaltungsorientierte Forschungâ, and more specifically the design-based research approach, this thesis examines the phases of conception, design, development, implementation and assessment of the web-based training 321via.ch â a learning platform conceived to develop Italian language skills at A1-B2 level on the one hand and interlinguistic and intercultural competences specific to the Swiss Italian reality on the other. The end result consists of a technical solution (a learning content management system with a highly flexible authoring tool) and an educational solution, consisting of some thirty learning objects and about 200 learning tasks.

The summative assessment that concludes this thesis focusses on the impact of the first solution on both the editorial team and university students of Italian Language Education and of the second on a sample of Italian teachers and high school students: data collected allows for an evaluation of the respondentsâ perception of 321via.ch usefulness as a teaching or learning tool and their willingness to refer to it in the future, at the same time pointing to possible paths for future developments and further research.

Anche se tutelato a livello giuridico, negli ultimi due decenni lâinsegnamento dellâitaliano ha subito, nella prassi, numerosi attacchi che hanno evidenziato il bisogno di interventi politico-linguistici ed educativi. 

Il seguente progetto si situa in questâultimo ambito dâazione e mira a colmare una lacuna nel panorama delle offerte didattiche per lâinsegnamento dellâitaliano in Svizzera. Seguendo il paradigma della gestaltungsorientierte Forschung, e piÃ¹ in particolare lâapproccio della design-based research, la presente tesi studia le fasi di ideazione, progettazione, sviluppo, implementazione e valutazione del web-based training 321via.ch, una piattaforma didattica volta a sviluppare da un lato competenze linguistiche ricettive dellâitaliano ai livelli A1-B2 e dallâaltro competenze interlinguistiche e interculturali specifiche alla realtÃ  italofona elvetica. Il prodotto cosÃ¬ elaborato si compone di una soluzione tecnologica, un learning content management system con un software autore particolarmente flessibile, e di una soluzione didattica composta da una trentina di learning object e da circa 200 learning task. 

Oggetto dellâanalisi sommativa che conclude questa tesi Ã¨ lâimpatto del primo artefatto sul team redazionale e su studenti di didattica dellâitaliano LS e del secondo artefatto su un gruppo di insegnanti e di studenti di liceo: i dati permettono di valutare se gli intervistati, nella propria percezione soggettiva, considerano 321via.ch uno strumento dâinsegnamento o dâapprendimento utile a cui fare riferimento anche in futuro, fornendo inoltre spunti per sviluppi futuri e ulteriori ricerche",multimedia,106,not included

system for geometric reconstruction, object-class segmentation and learning of
3D scenes. Using our system, a user can walk into a room wearing a depth camera
and a virtual reality headset, and both densely reconstruct the 3D scene and
interactively segment the environment into object classes such as 'chair',
'floor' and 'table'. The user interacts physically with the real-world scene,
touching objects and using voice commands to assign them appropriate labels.
These user-generated labels are leveraged by an online random forest-based
machine learning algorithm, which is used to predict labels for previously
unseen parts of the scene. The entire pipeline runs in real time, and the user
stays 'in the loop' throughout the process, receiving immediate feedback about
the progress of the labelling and interacting with the scene as necessary to
refine the predicted segmentation.Comment: 33 pages, Project: http://www.semantic-paint.com, Code:

Along with Pervasive Computing - entered in the mainstream with the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) - Mixed Reality (MR) is going to be an essential ingredient for the design and development of next future smart environments. In particular, in such environments is feasible to imagine that the computation will drive the augmentation of the physical space, and software will also be executed in a cyber-physical world, eventually populated with of (interactive) holograms. 
 
After an initial exploration of the state of the art about augmentation technologies both for humans and the environment, in this dissertation we present the vision of Augmented Worlds (AW), a conceptual and a practical proposal for modelling and engineering next future pervasive mixed reality smart environments as distribute, multi-user and cooperative complex software systems. 
On the one hand, a meta-model is formalised and opportunely discussed to offer to the literature a conceptual tool for modelling AWs. On the other hand, also a concrete infrastructure - called MiRAgE - is designed and developed to produce a platform for engineering and deploy such innovative smart environments. 
 
The work carried out in this dissertation fits into the scientific literature and research of Pervasive Computing and Mixed Reality fields. Furthermore, part of the contribution is related also to the area of Cognitive Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, due to the AWs orientation to be deeply connected to a layer involving autonomous agents able to observe and act proactively in the smart environment.",multimedia,108,not included

is an information warfare term for the use of deception on an opposing force.
We suggest that an ATD attack could change the sentiment of text in a web
browser. This could alter the victim's perception of reality by providing
disinformation. Within the limit of online communication, even a pause in
replying to a text can affect how people perceive each other. The outcomes of
an ATD attack could include alienation, upsetting a victim, and influencing

AI systems which perform relatively simple tasks in the early stages of the development period are expected to become fully or largely autonomous in the near future. Thanks to this, AI which includes the concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and autonomy, has begun to play an important role in producing and using smart arms. However, questions about AI-Based Lethal Weapon Systems (AILWS) and attacks that can be carried out by such systems have not been fully answered under legal aspect. More particularly, it is a controversial issue who will be responsible for the actions that an AILWS has committed. In this article, we discussed whether AILWS can commit offense in the context of the Rome Statute, examined the applicable law regarding the responsibility of AILWS, and tried to assess whether these systems can be held responsible in the context of international law, crime of aggression, and individual responsibility. It is our finding that international legal rules including the Rome Statute can be applied regarding the responsibility for the act/crime of aggression caused by AILWS. However, no matter how advanced the cognitive capacity of an AI software, it will not be possible to resort to the personal responsibility of this kind of system since it has no legal personality at all. In such a case, responsibility will remain with the actors who design, produce, and use the system. Last but not least, since no AILWS software does have specific codes of conduct that can make legal and ethical reasonings for today, at the end of the study it was recommended that states and non-governmental organizations together with manifacturers should constitute the necessary ethical rules written in software programs to prevent these systems from unlawful acts and to develop mechanisms that would restrain AI from working outside human control.",science,110,not included

The virtual lab is made of a web-based application to complement experimental laboratory training, allowing students to prepare their experimental practices before going to the lab, and to review them at any time afterwards. The computer application exhibits key virtual-lab educational features, like an integrative layout and self-evaluating tests. It allows a personalized and active learning-process, adaptability to teacher's aims and versatility and simplicity, using different multimedia resources. A satisfaction questionnaire was carried out between master degree students to evaluate the usefulness of the VL. Such a tool was positively evaluated, achieving a mean score of 6 out of 7 points.

                  Social skills training (SST) intervention has shown its efficacy to improve social dysfunction in patients with psychosis; however the implementation of new skills into patients' everyday functioning is difficult to achieve. In this study, we report results from the application of a virtual reality (VR) integrated program as an adjunct technique to a brief social skills intervention for patients with schizophrenia. It was predicted that the intervention would improve social cognition and performance of patients as well as generalisation of the learned responses into patient's daily life.
               
                  Methods
                  Twelve patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed the study. They attended sixteen individual one-hour sessions, and outcome assessments were conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment and four-month follow-up.
               
                  Results
                  The results of a series of repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant improvement in negative symptoms, psychopathology, social anxiety and discomfort, avoidance and social functioning. Objective scores obtained through the use of the VR program showed a pattern of learning in emotion perception, assertive behaviours and time spent in a conversation. Most of these gains were maintained at four-month follow-up.
               
                  Limitations
                  The reported results are based on a small, uncontrolled pilot study. Although there was an independent rater for the self-reported and informant questionnaires, assessments were not blinded.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The results showed that the intervention may be effective for improving social dysfunction. The use of the VR program contributed to the generalisation of new skills into the patient's everyday functioning.",science,112,not included

In Australia, the discourse around ethical AI does not accord with the reality of AI deployment in the public sector. Drawing on institutional ethnographic approaches, this paper describes the misalignments between how technology is described in government documentation, and how it is deployed in social service delivery. We argue that the propagation of ethical principles legitimates established new public management strategies, and pre-empts questions regarding the efficacy of AI development; instead positioning implementation as inevitable and, provided an ethical framework is adopted, laudable. The ethical AI discourse acknowledges, and ostensibly seeks to move past, widely reported administrative failures involving new technologies.

The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable.

An optimal antibiotic therapy (ABX) is paramount for success. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a well investigated biomarker that allows close monitoring of the infection and management of ABX. It has proven to be a cost-efficient diagnostic tool. In Diagnoses Related Groups (DRG) based reimbursement systems, hospitals get only a fixed amount of money for certain treatments. Thus it's very important to obtain an optimal balance of clinical treatment and resource consumption namely the length of stay in hospital and especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We investigated which economic effects an optimized PCT-based algorithm for antibiotic management could have.</p> <p>Materials and methods</p> <p>We collected inpatient episode data from 16 hospitals. These data contain administrative and clinical information such as length of stay, days in the ICU or diagnoses and procedures. From various RCTs and reviews there are different algorithms for the use of PCT to manage ABX published. Moreover RCTs and meta-analyses have proven possible savings in days of ABX (ABD) and length of stay in ICU (ICUD). As the meta-analyses use studies on different patient populations (pneumonia, sepsis, other bacterial infections), we undertook a short meta-analyses of 6 relevant studies investigating in sepsis or ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). From this analyses we obtained savings in ABD and ICUD by calculating the weighted mean differences. Then we designed a new PCT-based algorithm using results from two very recent reviews. The algorithm contains evidence from several studies. From the patient data we calculated cost estimates using German National standard costing information for the German G-DRG system.</p> <p>We developed a simulation model where the possible savings and the extra costs for (in average) 8 PCT tests due to our algorithm were brought into equation.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>We calculated ABD savings of -4 days and ICUD reductions of -1.8 days. our algorithm contains recommendations for ABX onset (PCT â¥ 0.5 ng/ml), validation whether ABX is appropriate or not (Delta from day 2 to day 3 â¥ 30% indicates inappropriate ABX) and recommendations for discontinuing ABX (PCT â¤ 0.25 ng/ml).</p> <p>We received 278, 264 episode datasets where we identified by computer-based selection 3, 263 cases with sepsis. After excluding cases with length of stay (LOS) too short to achieve the intended savings, we ended with 1, 312 cases with ICUD and 268 cases without ICUD. Average length of stay of ICU-patients was 27.7 Â± 25.7 days and for Non-ICU patients 17.5 Â± 14.6 days respectively. ICU patients had an average of 8.8 Â± 8.7 ICUD.</p> <p>After applying the simulation model on this population we calculated possible savings of â¬ -1, 163, 000 for ICU-patients and â¬ -36, 512 for Non-ICU patients.</p> <p>Discussion</p> <p>Our findings concerning the savings from the reduction of ABD are consistent with other publications. Savings ICUD had never been economically evaluated so far. our algorithm is able to possibly set a new standard in PCT-based ABX. However the findings are based on data modelling. The algorithm will be implemented in 5-10 hospitals in 2012 and effects in clinical reality measured 6 months after implementation.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Managing sepsis with daily monitoring of PCT using our refined algorithm is suitable to save substantial costs in hospitals. Implementation in clinical routine settings will show how much of the calculated effect will be achieved in reality.</p",science,115,not included

Consequently, a limited number of researchers work on applying machine learning in real-world robots. In this paper, we use two intelligent black-box optimization algorithms, Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), to solve a quadruped robot gait's parametric search problem in 10 dimensions, and compare these two methods to find which one is more suitable for legged robots' controller parameters tuning. Our results show that both methods can find an optimal solution in 130 iterations. BO converges faster than CMA-ES within its constrained range, while CMA-ES finds the optimum in the continuous space. Compared with the specific controller parameters of two methods, we also find that for quadruped robot's oscillators, the angular amplitude is the most important parameter. Thus, it is very beneficial for the quick parametric search of legged robots' controllers and avoids time-consuming manual tuning.",robotics,116,not included

Methods A narrative review of the literature was performed on MEDLINE/Pubmed and Scopus database on the topics of artificial intelligence, autonomous surgery, machine learning, robotic surgery, and surgical navigation, focusing on articles published between January 2015 and June 2019. All available evidences were analyzed and summarized herein after an interactive peer-review process of the panel. Literature review The preliminary results of the implementation of AI in clinical setting are encouraging. By providing a readout of the full telemetry and a sophisticated viewing console, robot-assisted surgery can be used to study and refine the application of AI in surgical practice. Machine learning approaches strengthen the feedback regarding surgical skills acquisition, efficiency of the surgical process, surgical guidance and prediction of postoperative outcomes. Tension-sensors on the robotic arms and the integration of augmented reality methods can help enhance the surgical experience and monitor organ movements. Conclusions The use of AI in robotic surgery is expected to have a significant impact on future surgical training as well as enhance the surgical experience during a procedure.

It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p=0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p=0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p=0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p=0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p=0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p=0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p=0.49) and NOTSS (p>0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.ConclusionsPart- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention.

There are objective reasons, significant advantages, and serious business challenges. The ongoing digital transformation creates some of the largest economic, political and social challenges for the European Union. Despite new opportunities, it is frequently perceived as a threat to traditional business models, current organizational structures, and well-established business operations. Economic question about the competitiveness and capabilities in new technologies are linked to needs of skills and knowledge developing in Europe. It is an incredible for exploring the processes. For Ukrainian researchers, this issue may be interesting in the context of the European integration and understanding of digitalization processes in the EU, comparing them with Ukrainian realities, and identifying possibilities for benchmarking of the European experience. The main aim of the paper is to focus on the skills necessary to managers to operate in a digital era.There are no doubts that the nature of work changes, new jobs emerge while others disappear, so people need to gain new skills. Approximately 30% of the current jobs in the European Union may disappear over the next 25 years with the emergence of new professions requiring advanced digital skills [1]. Therefore, a critical element in the digital economy is to define and to acquire skills for business development in digital era. We are trying to focus on the skills critical for the EUâs growth and mitigation of losses caused by the digital transformation (by cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence.An important factor to be taken into consideration is the fact that the society is not fully aware of the real situation. Digital business (or digital era, digital transformation) is taken for almost granted. But in reality the digital economy is highly concentrated in two countries (USA and China):-Â Â Â Â Â Â  50% of global spending on IoT-Â Â Â Â Â Â  more than 75% of the cloud computing market-Â Â Â Â Â Â  75% of all patents related to blockchain technologies [2].Moreover:-Â Â Â Â Â Â  about 10 % of the EU labour force has no digital skills;-Â Â Â Â Â Â  35 % of the EU labour does not have basic digital skills;-Â Â Â Â Â Â  about 28 % of the EU's internet users have no software-related skills [1].Also it is important to understand that digital skills which can be defined as abilities to use digital devices, communication applications, and networks to find information are (to some extend) basic or consumer skills that are mechanically honed and do not require serious intellectual effort. While digital skills also mean abilities to manage information, it is a higher level skill, but it is still a basic skill in the digital age. The shift of value creation towards digital platforms, new security and standard solutions, big data usage and data quality call for more complex skills. According to UNCTAD Digital Economy Report 2019, the expansion of the Internet of Things and various data-driven business models will require specialists who can convert big data into information and knowledge that are:- data scientist;- data engineers;- data architects and data visualizators [2].And we're focusing on the ability to use business opportunities including the increasing amounts of data. These require broader skill sets, skills to combine analytical, software and information systems with business. Data analysts and scientists also need to be business savvy to help enterprises capture business opportunities from their analyses. Multiple skills that combine sound technical skills with entrepreneurial skills and vertical and business process management expertise are particularly important [3].It is noteworthy that only 12% of EU enterprises used big data in 2018, 9% of EU enterprises - in 2016 [3]. That is, 88% and 91% did not use. Accordingly, the issue is not only about to capture business opportunities but skills to see the existing opportunities at least. That is why the EU awareness campaigns were oriented on alert the real picture:Â â WATIFY - launched in 2014 with the goal to push people towards concrete action to create their digital start-up, or digitally transform their business;â e-Skills for jobs and growth â launched in 2014 with an idea to strengthen competences and e-leadership;âÂ  Start Up Europe Initiative to strengthen the environment for Web Entrepreneurs to start and stay in Europe.In 2018, the vast majority (92Â %) of EU enterprises with at least 10 persons employed used the internet 77Â % of EU enterprises have a website. In 2018, 1 in 5 EU enterprises employed ICT specialists; the percentage of large enterprises employing ICT specialists (75Â %) is more than 4 times higher than that for SMEs (18Â %) [3]. The difference in big data and Internet usage statistics may be explained by an understanding of the benefits and personal routine of the latest one in life. Once upon a time, such breakthrough and unusual things became household. And big data or the Internet of Things are not conscious, and it is impossible to build a business model on the obscure.That is a problem for the leaders of European companies in understanding the potential of artificial intelligence or data analytics. It is not just about that Europe needs an additional 20 million early stage entrepreneurs to close the gap with the US and China, but also about a high intensity of utilization of novel digital technologies (social, big data, mobile and cloud solutions) to improve business operations, invent new models in three directions:â ability to reach out and partner with customers more effectively;â inner processes;â business models - the way value is created, delivered and captured.The digital transformation from a European management angle should include strategic vision how to combine analytical, software and information systems with business. Skills for European business development in digital era refers to leadership in the new era, it does not matter traditional or digital business â the reality is changing in general.The skills for European business development must combine:- ICT user skillsÂ to apply systems as tools in support of own work. It can be common software tools or specialised tools supporting business functions within industry;- skills required for researching, developing, designing, strategic planning, managing, producing, consulting, marketing, selling, integrating, installing, administering, maintaining, supporting and servicing ICT systems;- business skillsÂ correspond to the capabilities to exploit opportunities provided by ICT; to ensure more efficient and effective performance of different types of organisations; to explore possibilities for new ways of conducting business and organisational processes; and to establish new businesses [3].A little different set of skills is proposed by publication âE-Leadership Digital Skills for SMEsâ of the EC [4]:- strategic leadership skills to lead interâdisciplinary staff, and influence stakeholders across boundaries (functional, geographic);â business savvy: innovate business and operating models, delivering value to organisations;â digital savvy: envision and drive change for business performance, exploiting digital technology trends as innovation opportunities [4].To summarize, it should be noted that the new era creates opportunities for all businesses, the question is to see these opportunities and successfully use them. Entrepreneurship and business may not be fundamentally changing at any time, but the tool usage requires understanding, if not details, so the overall potential and range of capabilities of this tool. In the digital age, digital skills (both basic and complex) are understanding how to use the tool. On the other hand, the strategic leadership skills and the business savvy.",industry,121,not included

The automation of software testing activities is essential to certify productivity and effectiveness in such activities. Test automation leads testing activities to be conducted under systematic and accurate criteria, raising the chance of testers to reveal faults or inconsistencies. Test oracles are elementary members in software testing automation, being the mechanism responsible for indicating the correctness of software outputs. In testing environments, test oracles can be effectively implemented based on several sources of information about the Software Under Testing (SUT): software specifications, assertions, formal methods (Finite State Machines (FSM), formal specifications, etc, machine-learning methods, and metamorphic relations. Regardless of the implementation strategy, test oracles are vulnerable to false positive/negative verdicts, configuring what the literature describes as the oracle problem. Therefore, test oracles are a non-trivial and challenging object of studies of the software engineering research area. SUTs outputs in unusual formats make it harder the oracle problem. Audio, images, three-dimensional objects, virtual reality environments, complex statistical compositions, etc, are examples of non-trivial output formats. In the software testing context, SUTs with unusual outputs can be called complex-output systems. In this doctorate dissertation, we propose and evaluate a novel test oracle approach for complex-output systems called feature-based test oracles. The purpose of feature-based test oracles is the appropriation of a processing image technique called Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) to collect information from features extracted from the SUTs outputs to compose test oracles. Given a query image, CBIR combines feature extraction and similarity functions to alleviate the problem of searching for digital images in large databases. In previous research, we have integrated CBIR concepts in a testing framework to support the automation of testing activities in processing image systems and systems with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). In this doctorate dissertation, we extended that framework and its concepts to general complex-output systems, addressing the feature-based test oracle approach. We use Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems to validate empirically our test oracle technique. Through the results of five empirical analyses, three of them conducted in line with problems of a real-world industry TTS system, show the proposed technique is a valuable instrument to automate testing activities and alleviate practitioners efforts on testing complex output systems. We conclude the proposed test oracles are effective because they systematically evaluate the SUTs sensorial output rather than produce verdicts based on subjective specifications. As future work, we plan to conduct investigations towards the reduction of false positives/negatives and the association of the test oracles with machine learning techniques and metamorphic relations.Teste de Software Ã© um dos processos mais importantes da Engenharia de Software, sendo a principal atividade para averiguar a conformidade de requisitos de software e suas saÃ­das. A automatizaÃ§Ã£o das atividades de teste Ã© essencial para conferir produtividade e efetividade em tais atividades. A automatizaÃ§Ã£o faz com que atividades de teste sejam conduzidas sob critÃ©rios sistemÃ¡ticos e precisos, aumentando a chance dos testadores de revelarem falhas ou inconcistÃªncias. OrÃ¡culos de teste sÃ£o membros elementares na automatizaÃ§Ã£o do teste de software, sendo o mecanismo responsÃ¡vel por indicar a corretude das saÃ­das do softwre. Em ambientes de teste, orÃ¡culos de teste podem ser efetivamente implementados com base em diversos fontes de informaÃ§Ã£o sobre o sistema em teste: especificaÃ§Ãµes de software, assertivas, mÃ©todos formais (mÃ¡quinas de estados finitas, especificaÃ§Ãµes formais, etc), mÃ©todos de aprendizagem de mÃ¡quina e relaÃ§Ãµes metamÃ³rficas. Independente da estratÃ©gia de implementaÃ§Ã£o, orÃ¡culos de teste sÃ£o vulnerÃ¡veis a veridictos de falsos positivos/negativos, configurando o que Ã© apresentado na literatura como O problema do OrÃ¡culo. EntÃ£o, na Ã¡rea de engenharia de software, orÃ¡culos de teste sÃ£o objetos de estudo nÃ£o-triviais e desafiadores. O problema de orÃ¡culo Ã© potencializado quando as saÃ­das do sistema em teste sÃ£o dadas em formatos nÃ£o triviais como, por exemplo, audio, imagens, objetos tridimensionais, ambientes de realidade virtual, composiÃ§Ãµes estatÃ­sticas complexas, etc. No contexto do teste de software, sistemas com saÃ­das nÃ£o triviais podem ser chamados de sistemas com saÃ­das complexas. Esta tese de doutorado propÃµes e avalia uma nova estratÃ©gia de orÃ¡culo de teste para sistemas com saÃ­das complexas. O propÃ³sito de tal estratÃ©gia Ã© a apropriaÃ§Ã£o da tÃ©cnica de processamento de imagem conhecida como CBIR (RecuperaÃ§Ã£o de Imagem Basead em ConteÃºdo  CBIR) para coletar informaÃ§Ãµes de caracterÃ­sticas extratÃ­das do sistema em teste, compondo orÃ¡culos de teste. A partir de uma imagem de busca, o CBIR combina extraÃ§Ã£o de caracterÃ­sticas e funÃ§Ãµes de similaridade para aliviar problemas de busca em grandes based de imagens digitais. Em pesquisas anteriores, conceitos de CBIR foram integrados em um arcabouÃ§o de teste para apoiar a automatizaÃ§Ã£o de atividades de teste em systemas de processamento de imagens e sistemas com interfaces grÃ¡ficas. Esta tese de doutorado estende o arcabouÃ§o e seus conceitos para sistemas com saÃ­das complexas em geral. Sistemas Texto-Fala (TTS) foram utlizados para validaÃ§Ãµes empÃ­ricas. Os resultados de seis anÃ¡lises empÃ­ricas, duas delas condizidas em consonÃ¢ncia com problemas de um TTS industrial, revelam que a tÃ©cnica proposta Ã© um valioso instrumento para automatizar atividaes de teste e aliviar esforÃ§os de profissionais da indÃºstria ao teste sistemas com saÃ­das complexas. Conclui-se que a efetividade dos orÃ¡culos de teste propostos sÃ£o devido Ã s sistemÃ¡ticas anÃ¡lises do conteÃºdo das saÃ­das dos sistemas em teste, em vez da anÃ¡lises de especificaÃ§Ãµes subjetivas. Os trabalhos futuros vislumbrados devem ser conduzidos no intuito de reduzir nÃºmero de falsos positivos/negativos e a associaÃ§Ã£o dos orÃ¡culos de teste com tÃ©cnicas de aprendizado de mÃ¡quina e relaÃ§Ãµes metamÃ³rficas",industry,122,not included

They are present in our wallet, in our car, in our house appliances and the current tendency is to control more and more things by using them. Major companies already started to envision the future of internet which become known as the Internet of Things. In the next years, more and more of our things will be smart, connected... and subject to software flaws.Micro-controllers, very small devices with a few hundreds bytes of memory, are at the heart of this revolution. They become cheaper, smaller and more powerful. Yet, contrary to the technologies used in our desktop computers or our server farms, the goal of the industry that creates these devices is not power. Indeed, controlling temperature in your home or humidity in your wine cellar does not need Gigahertz core. It even does not need multiple cores. What these devices need is to be cheap, to be able to be produced in very high volumes and to use small amount of electrical energy. In this context, the moore's law does not help us to have more cores in one device, but it allows to produce more devices with the same amount of silicon. The research I made in the past years try to reduce the gap between cheap software and robust and efficient software for these devices. I think that, by providing smart tools and production toolchains we can help junior or non specialized developers so that they can produce good embedded software for a reasonable development cost. I also focus my work on optimizing and providing efficient and secure software and network protocols, so that the Internet of Things can become a reality while respecting user privacy and being sustainable from a energy point of view.I focused my research on three aspects. First, I focused on how to allow larger softwares do be developped in embedded systems. In particular, we proposed techniques to allow Java/JavaCard code to be executed from a non-addressable memory using a full software cache.  I also looked at how to use domain specific languages to ease the implementation of a collaborative network intrusions detection system. Thanks to adapted tools, the software, writen in the DSL, can be compiled for a wide range of probes while offering garanties on the produced software. Last, I focused on energy aware network protocols in the context of smart cities.Au cours des derniÃ¨res annÃ©es, les systÃ¨mes embarquÃ©s sont de plus en plus prÃ©sents dans notre vie de tous les jours. Ils sont dans notre portefeuille, dans notre voiture ou dans nos appareils mÃ©nagers. La tendance actuelle est Ã  contrÃ´ler de plus en plus d'objets Ã  l'aide de ces systÃ¨mes. Les grands acteurs de l'industrie ont dÃ©jÃ  commencÃ© Ã  envisager le futur de l'internet, l'internet des objets. Dans les annÃ©es Ã  venir, de plus en plus de nos objets seront Â«Â intelligentsÂ Â», connectÃ©s... et sujets Ã  des fautes logicielles.Les micro contrÃ´leurs, de minuscules ordinateurs possÃ©dant quelques centaines d'octets de mÃ©moire, sont au coeur de cette rÃ©volution. Ils deviennent de moins en moins cher et de plus en plus puissant. NÃ©anmoins, Ã  la diffÃ©rence de nos ordinateurs de bureau ou des serveurs, le but de l'industrie des micro contrÃ´leurs n'est pas la puissance. En effet, contrÃ´ler la tempÃ©rature de notre maison et le taux d'humiditÃ© de notre cave Ã  vin ne nÃ©cessite pas des processeurs cadencÃ©s Ã  plusieurs gigahertz. Cela ne nÃ©cessite mÃªme pas plusieurs coeurs de calculs. Le vÃ©ritable besoin de ces Ã©quipements est d'Ãªtre bons marchÃ©, d'Ãªtre produits en trÃ¨s grands volumes, d'Ãªtres petits, facilement intÃ©grables et d'utiliser une faible quantitÃ© d'Ã©nergie Ã©lectrique. Le meilleur exemple de cette tendance est trÃ¨s certainement la carte Ã  puce. Depuis le dÃ©but des annÃ©es 90, de plus en plus de cartes Ã  puce sont produites, vendues et utilisÃ©es dans le monde. Cependant, elles n'en restent pas moins de tout petits Ã©quipements d'une puissance infÃ©rieure de plusieurs ordres de grandeur de nos ordinateurs de bureau. Quand il s'agit de dÃ©velopper du logiciel pour ces Ã©quipements, un dÃ©veloppeur dÃ©butant n'est gÃ©nÃ©ralement pas suffisamment prÃ©parÃ© et ne sera pas capable d'Ã©crire du logiciel efficace pour ces cibles avant de longue annÃ©es passÃ©es Ã  gagner de l'expÃ©rience et de l'expertise. Si le logiciel que l'ont souhaite produire doit Ãªtre efficace, sÃ»r et correct au sens le plus strict du terme, l'industrie doit compter sur des dÃ©veloppeurs trÃ¨s spÃ©cialisÃ©s, expÃ©rimentÃ©s et donc chers. Les acteurs industriels ont donc deux alternatives : produire du logiciel bon marchÃ©, mais assez inefficaceet dÃ©fectueux ou dÃ©penser une somme importante pour le dÃ©veloppement et fournir un logiciel de bonne qualitÃ©. On peu aisÃ©ment supposer que la tendance actuelle est au logiciel bon marchÃ©, et que la probabilitÃ© que le logiciel qui Ã©quipera les millions d'Ã©quipements formant l'internet des objets sera de piÃ¨tre qualitÃ© et offrira quantitÃ© de failles que des acteurs malveillants se feront une joie d'exploiter si rien n'est fait pour rendre bon marchÃ© le dÃ©veloppement correct de logiciels embarquÃ©s.Mes recherches de ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es vont dans le sens de la rÃ©duction du fossÃ© sÃ©parant logiciels bon marchÃ© et logiciels sÃ»rs et performants. Je suis convaincu qu'en offrant des outils Â«Â intelligentsÂ Â» et des chaÃ®nes de production logicielle efficaces, nous pouvons aider les dÃ©veloppeurs dÃ©butants, ou non spÃ©cialisÃ©s, Ã  produire du logiciel embarquÃ© de bonne qualitÃ© pour un coÃ»t de dÃ©veloppement raisonnable. J'ai Ã©galement portÃ© mon attention sur l'optimisation et la sÃ©curisation des logiciels et des protocoles rÃ©seau afin que l'internet des objets puisse devenir une rÃ©alitÃ© tout en respectant la vie privÃ©e des utilisateurs et en offrant une alternative durable sur le plan Ã©nergÃ©tique.Je me suis principalement intÃ©ressÃ© Ã  trois champs de recherche. Tout d'abord, j'ai cherchÃ© Ã  permettre l'utilisation de techniques de dÃ©veloppement standard (objets, composants, programmation en Javaâ¦) Ã  la faible capacitÃ© mÃ©moire des Ã©quipements embarquÃ©s. A l'inverse, je me suis Ã©galement intÃ©ressÃ© Ã  l'utilisation de langages dÃ©diÃ©s Ã  une application afin de permettre Ã  des spÃ©cialistes du domaine de la sÃ©curitÃ© rÃ©seau d'exprimer des algorithmes de dÃ©tection d'intrusions. A l'aide d'une suite d'outils dÃ©diÃ©e, ces algorithmes sont compilÃ©s et optimisÃ©s automatiquement pour Ãªtre utilisÃ©s dans une architecture distribuÃ©e de sondes embarquÃ©es. Enfin, je me suis intÃ©ressÃ© aux protocoles rÃ©seau Ã©conomes en Ã©nergie pour interconnecter les Ã©quipements embarquÃ©s dans le cadre des villes intelligentes",industry,123,not included

based on movement and sound interaction",,"Computer generated images have always drawn the attention of millions of people in their different roles: students, professors, researchers, designers, movie directors, etc. It is not only the magic of generating synthetic, static and/or dynamic images, emulations or simulations of reality, but of capturing all the creative abilities of the human being to narrate events, from the memory of the past, descriptions of current reality and projections towards the future. In other words, they may be timeless images and malleable towards the infinite.

In them rests the freedom of expression in a chromatic and three-dimensional way where sometimes it is difficult to see whether we are in the face of something real or virtual. It is the charm of the viewing power of communication where an image is always worth more than a thousand words. Not for nothing when the first graphics appeared to depict the numerical information in the offices, it marked the beginning of the use of computers in the businesses with professional purposes until they reached the home. It was these synthetic images which collaborated to change the meaning of the PC initials, that is, from professional computer to personal computer.

The risk lies in the fact that those who manage those images respect the final viewer, at the moment they are presented to his/her eyes. That is, a transparent communication avoiding manipulation through them. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the written word takes again a prevailing place in the communicative process, and one goes back to the time of the appearance of print. It is in this regressive period where the human and social factors may be inserted, which generate different types of structures which do not change over time.

Although we are in one of the most dynamic sectors of the current interactive systems, we may come across in some places of the Old Continent with dogmas and their supporters, who slow down the whole creative process which entails working with these computer-made images. Now if the human and social factors are positive, in view of the constant advances of the graphic hardware and software, the only limit that exists is the imagination or originality at the moment of generating static and/or dynamic images in 2D and 3D.

Computer graphics and computer animation along with text, audio and video have been key in the momentum of the Internet phenomenon of the 20th century. In the new millennium they have been the main means of drawing the attention of the users to the screens of a great variety of devices of classical computing.

There are millions of users who decide to purchase computer equipment because of the images that they can see on the screens. These images gain in quality thanks to their generation from scratch and thanks also to myriad techniques, methods, algorithms, etc. related to computer graphics down to the access to the information stored in the database, such as decompressed files with multimedia information available via the interaction of the user through the various peripherals.

Virtual images are generated in 2D and/or 3D, thanks to democratization of the pixels in 1990 \u2013 2000. Users are now capable of generating images in movement for 3D starting from photographs with digital cameras or the commercial applications to generate films with computer animations.

In this whole productive process, whether it is at a personal or an industrial level the cost factor is always present, in the equation of maximum quality in the least possible time. To reach that goal it is necessary to resort to several quality attributes that have an influence from the design stage right until the programming of the applications used in the context of graphic informatics.

Our intention in the current handbook is to show an essential part of those strategies and also the latest breakthroughs in all that which is directly or indirectly related to computer graphics, computer animation, database, software quality, hypermedia, design, communicability, interfaces, cloud computing, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, computer-aided design, mixed reality, models, techniques and methods of computer science, etc.

Some of the works that make up the current compendium have been presented orally by their authors in the following international conference in Venice, Italy: SETECEC 2012 \u2013First International Conference on Software and Emerging Technologies for Education, Culture, Entertainment, and Commerce: New Directions in Multimedia Mobile Computing, Social Networks, Human-Computer Interaction and Communicability, and international symposium in Valle d'Aosta, Italy: CCGIDIS 2012 \u2013Second International Symposium on Communicability, Computer Graphics and Innovative Design for Interactive Systems.

The innovation and originality of those proposals has been the reason for which the authors have been invited to enlarge their works submitting again the new versions to an assessment process of said works by the members of the scientific committee. Consequently, these are works that have gone satisfactorily through a double process of international selection. In the next section a short introductory presentation of the research works that make up the current compendium is given:

The authors Luigi Barazzetti and  Marco Scaioni present an interesting work \u201cTransforming Images and Laser Scans into 3D Models\u201d where theory and practice converge in the context of 3D images. They introduce all details of the use of a laser scanner to obtain high quality three-dimensional images and accuracy in the maintenance and the virtual reconstruction of cultural heritage, for instance. Besides, they comprehensively describe computer vision and photogrammetric 3D modeling techniques that are mainly based on images or laser scans. The description further covers the integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or theodolite data allowing precise geo-referencing. The main goal they have set themselves is to indicate the reliability and robustness of their combined use for real surveys. Simultaneously a set of real examples serves to illustrate each one of the advantages and disadvantages of the used methods and techniques. In these examples the resolution of complex problems and with reduced costs can be verified. Each one of the issues is approached in a didactic way which facilitates the understanding even of the diverse devices used for the measurements.

Chih-Fang Huang, Chih-Hsiang Liang, and En-Ju Lin are the authors of the chapter \u201cSound-Color Synaesthetic Effect Using Algorithmic Composition with Image for Emotional Release.\u201d In said research they present the qualities of music from an emotive point of view. This is one of the motivations why they spread their study to the field of colors. In this sense, they develop an emotional model for music based on studies of color theory. Another main goal is to present the emotions of the users of a special software starting from the color and the electronic sounds that these represent from the psychological point of view, an approach informed by studies belonging to the set of the music color synesthesis and emotion releasing effect. Throughout the research work the authors explain in a gradual, simple and thorough way each one of the presented concepts with their matching theoretical examples and also the use of a special software for the experiments they have carried out.

The research work \u201cUser-created Interior Design Service Concepts, Interfaces and Outlines for Augmented Reality\u201d has been made by the following authors Tiina Kym\ue4l\ue4inen and Sanni Siltanen. This research work presents us masterfully a design process and the implementation requirements of an interactive interior design system. In said system the use of two focus groups can be detected where the knowledge and the experiences of designers, bloggers and serious amateurs in the field of interior design interact transversally. In that transversal interaction of diverse professionals the presence of user-driven innovation can be seen. The strategies of the conformation of the professionals and the transversal knowledge to the different areas of knowledge are explained with examples. Examples are given, which describe all the aspects of the new technologies applied to augmented reality, the results of tests with real users, the realization of a special software for the three-dimensional visualization of interiors, etc. Each one of the stages of the research project is accompanied by its corresponding textual and graphical explanations. Finally the authors make a wide-ranging reflection about the learned lessons signaling the positive and negative aspects of the used technology and also the future lines of research before their conclusions.

In the context of artificial intelligence, Damijan Novak and Domen Verber show us in their research \u201cNew Generation of Artificial Intelligence for Real-time Strategy Games\u201d the importance of applying it to computer games. The text starts with a complete state of the art overview, where the main notions to which the current research work refers are defined. In it is a constant interrelation among real-time strategy, games and artificial intelligence. The authors signal the importance of these issues within the academic field since they have detected new fields for research, whether in the present or the immediate future. Besides, in this work an excellent comparison example in the open-source real time strategy game development tools can be seen. The main and secondary goals of the text are gradually developed answering to a set of rhetorical questions with practical examples. All of this makes the reading and understanding easier to the potential readers. Their proposal of an enhanced combat artificial intelligence algorithm is striking in a very positive way.

The authors of the chapter \u201cTowards Smart Mobile System for Public Bus Transportation\u201d are Mitja Krajnc, Vili Podgorelec, and Marjan Heri\u10dko. In it converge the use of multimedia mobile phones and the geographical information systems (GPS satellite) for the localization of public buses in the town of Maribor, Slovenia. The system allows the user to see the movement of the buses in the road network through a real-time visualization on a mobile phone. The digital information which replaces the analogical one such as the timetables of the buses on paper support increases the available options of those users to access the public transportation system such as the combination of buses to reach a given destination. Besides, ease of use of the system can be seen since it is based on Windows Phone. Finally a quality attribute of the interactive systems such as the prediction has been incorporated to the system. The goal pursued by its authors is to increase the alternatives the user has at the moment of accessing the interactive information without this having negative repercussions on the visualization of the information inside the interface of the mobile phone.

Under the title \u201cA Learning Environment based on Movement and Sound Interaction\u201d its authors Serena Zanolla, Sergio Canazza, Antonio Rod\ue0, Giovanni De Poli, and Gian Luca Foresti present an Interactive Multimodal Environment for E-learning called \u201cStanza Logo-Motoria.\u201d The experiments carried out with children for the learning of a second language such as English have allowed the authors to carry out several experiments with positive results. A special module has been developed and tested in this sense called English as a Second Language (ESL). The motivation for learning languages in an environment of these characteristics is presented in a detailed way with a special stress on other aspects such as the socialization of early age users through new interactive technologies. Along with this the authors introduce technological aspects of interactive design which have been evolving as the experiments were carried out.

Michele Argiolas, Claudia Loggia, Vittorio Tramontin, and Cristina Trois are the authors of the chapter called \u201cA Web Application to Support Decision Making Process Based on a Bottom-up Approach in Public Buildings\u2019 Green Retrofit.\u201d They introduce a GIS web application related to such topics as green retrofit, public buildings, cost management just to mention three examples. The proposal starts with a comprehensive state of the art in legislation issues as technique of the main and secondary topics approached by its authors. The work shows how the implemented system online may serve to curtail the costs of management of green retrofitting public buildings. The study shows a constant interrelation among several disciplines of the sciences. Each of the issues is very well referenced in the bibliography section and they are developed in a pleasant way for the reader non-specialized in the issues approached at the start. Besides, there is a comparative study of real cases which entail additional advantages to the work developed by each one of the authors of the current text. Finally we can state that we are in front of an excellent triadic example of interrelations among databases, access to the stored information and the management of public administration.

The wide range of the phenomenon of the social networks requires in many of the offered services a set of recommendations. In this sense the authors Sa\u161o Karakati\u10d, Vili Podgorelec, and Marjan Heri\u10dko show in their research work \u201cMerging Social Networks and Semantic Databases to Build Recommendation Service\u201d the potential of linking semantic databases and social networks. Starting from Facebook and Freebase they have fashioned a prototype that uses Java technology. The prototype takes into consideration each one of the key elements for the recommendation of an online service to the potential users of contents in TV format, videogames, music, etc. In this sense we see a novel low cost solution is little by little brought forward by the authors along the pages. Besides, they have made a series of tests with users at the moment of interacting with the software and the hardware used. The results obtained back up the transcendence of the current proposal, and also the future developments they will make in a short time.

The three-dimensional reconstruction of the religious-historical heritage in the province of Avila (Spain) is the main objective of \u201cComputer Graphics to Encourage the Participation in the Virtual Reconstruction of Cultural Heritage: The Example of the Monastery of  Nuestra Se\uf1ora del Risco\u201d author of the chapter whose title is Gonzalo Mart\uedn S\ue1nchez. Starting from a reality which reveals the passing of time and the scarce remains of the walls of the monastery, the author resorts to several techniques using static images in 2D and 3D, such as historical cartography, digital photography, commercial software and open source, etc., for three-dimensional reconstruction. Now the author points out that these techniques from the field of computer graphics must be accompanied by a previous historical study of that is intended to be rebuilt. In this sense the illustrations, as well as the used methodology can serve as a guide for other analogous works.

In \u201cDeveloping Design Guidelines for E-Learning Environments: A War Story\u201d its authors Laura Benvenuti, Maria Menendez Blanco, and Gerrit C. van der Veer, denote the importance of the design, development, evaluation of a system oriented at university e-learning. A comprehensive study of the educational system to be developed with Moodle highlights the intersection between pedagogical theory, interactive design computer programming, among other areas of knowledge when it refers to blended academic education. A course on webculture has allowed the authors to carry out analyses of the web design. The university students belonging to the social sciences (culture, psychology, etc.) have taken part in several processes of heuristic evaluation to reach the goals proposed by the authors of the current research work. The learned lessons, future lines of research and the conclusions are interesting sections to understand the acquired experiences and for new research in the context of the blended education, distance learning, Internet based learning environments to mention a few examples.

The author presents a heuristic study of the evolution of human factors with their educational and social consequences in the context of the pixel of Southern Europe during the years 1990 \u2013 2012, under the title \u201cPixels: Educational Structures and Power Systems.\u201d Simultaneously, it is used for the first time a special language where diachronism interacts with the synchronism of the real examples that are presented, related to the graphics software. Besides, in this first research work are combined different techniques of the social sciences to establish the nodes and links which make up the human and functional structure of all that related to the commercial and educational pixel. Lastly, a series of strategies is put forward to analyse the educational quality of some training centers with regard to computer graphics and its derivations",industry,124,not included

Quello che in particolare si modifica non eâ tanto la professione in quanto tale, che mantiene la principale caratteristica di mediazione dellâinformazione, ma lâorganizzazione stessa del lavoro dei professionisti della notizia. La scelta dellâargomento della tesi parte dalla considerazione di questo dato di fatto, e la possibilitaâ di aver svolto uno stage presso la redazione della free press torinese âShop in the cityâ, e' stata lâoccasione per indagare direttamente sul campo i meccanismi di fare informazione nellâera digitale.
Partendo da questa prospettiva si eâ cercato innanzitutto di offrire una panoramica dei cambiamenti della professione e dei professionisti allâinterno della societaâ; unâanalisi degli sviluppi tecnologici che hanno contribuito in modo determinante al cambiamento del lavoro di giornalista; unâanalisi delle nuove forme di giornalismo che si sviluppano nellâera digitale. Parallelamente, un capitolo-intermezzo viene dedicato a due autori, Richard Florida e McKenzie Wark, i quali, partendo da prospettive diametralmente opposte, arrivano entrambi alla considerazione che nellâera digitale cioâ che rappresenta una vera produttrice di valore per la societaâ eâ la creativitÃ  degli individui, che si colloca proprio nellâintreccio tra rete e metropoli, tra virtuale e reale: lâinformale diventa la sorgente cui la societÃ  attinge per trovare i suoi nuovi contesti produttivi.
Queste considerazioni vengono applicate nella seconda parte del lavoro di tesi in cui viene analizzata la free press torinese âShop in the cityâ, sia nella sua realtaâ cartacea che soprattutto nella sua forma web. CiÃ² permette di applicare tutte le considerazioni fatte in fase teorica. In particolare lâanalisi dei punti di forza e di debolezza della parte online servono come spunto per presentare un progetto di implementazione del sito seguendo i pilastri della filosofia del web 2.0 e di un maggior coinvolgimento dellâutente, volendo dimostrare che oggi non conta piÃ¹ essere a tutti i costi online con un sito vetrina: occorre, nel terzo millennio che viviamo, fornire un vero servizio agli utenti di modo che essi effettivamente utilizzino il sito e siano fidelizzati alla navigazione.
Lo scopo finale eâ quindi quello di fornire in prima istanza una mappatura cognitiva dello scenario mediale degli ultimi anni, che sia forse utile ai vari dibattiti che alimentano la scena informativa riguardo al futuro dei giornali e ai possibili sviluppi del campo giornalistico attraverso lo sfruttamento delle potenzialitaâ dei new media; in seconda istanza, preso il caso pratico di una free press, si propone di offrire un esempio di come migliorare lo sfruttamento delle potenzialitÃ  di internet per fare informazione nellâera digitale.
In the third millennium the journalistic profession is going through an evolution and cannot ignore the new technological developments that have become an important and pervasive part of the shared lives of our society. It is not so much the profession itself which is changing, in the sense that it maintains itâs principal role of the mediation and distribution of information, but instead the way in which the work of news professionals is organised.
Based on this assumption, this work begins by offering an overview of the changes to the profession and to the professionals themselves; an analysis of the technological developments that have contributed to determining the changes in the work of a journalist and an analysis of the new forms of journalism that are developing in the digital era. In parallel, a part is dedicated to two authors, Richard Florida and McKenzie Wark, who both arrive at the conclusion that in the digital era that which represents a real increase in value for an organisation is the creativity of individuals, which can be seen as being placed in the crossover of network and metropolis,: the informal becomes the source on which the organisation draws to find itâs new production contexts.
These considerations are applied and discussed in the second part of the thesis in which the Turin-based free press âShop in the cityâ is analysed, both in itâs paper and web-based forms. This analysis allows the application of the theories discussed in the relevant part of the thesis and offers a practical example of the reality of journalism in the digital era. In particular, the analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of the online format provide a good basis for the development and presentation of an implementation project for the site, following the philosophies of web 2.0 and of increased user involvement, demonstrating that it is no longer enough simply to be online at all costs, or to only have a âwindow display siteâ: in this third millennium it is fundamental to provide a real service to users so that they can effectively navigate and make use of the site.
The final aim, therefore, is to provide in the first instance a cognitive map of the field over the past few years, something which may be of use in the various debates that rise in the sector about the future of newspapers and the possible future developments in the field of journalism through the use of new media techniques and methods.

The problem of organizing state and non-state institutions to combat the spread of fakes in the information space is to establish a parity (balance) between: citizens right to receive reliable/legal information protection, freedom of speech protection and expression (civil liberties) and protection of national interests of Ukraine. The existing imbalance caused by the lack of effective mechanisms to counteract misinformation and its dissemination through social media. In the EU countries at the state level the fight is not against misinformation, but with illegal (harmful, dangerous) content in the media and social media, which is ineffective for Ukraine in the face of existing challenges and threats related to the military conflict and occupation of part of state territory, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.
Previously unresolved parts of the overall problem. An unresolved part of the general problem is the lack of proper scientific substantiation of state mechanisms to combat disinformation and its dissemination in the media and social media.
The aim of the article is to develop strategic approaches and practical recommendations for combating misinformation and its dissemination in Ukraine by social media in the context of information and psychological attacks and the Covid-19 pandemic.
Main material. Digital technologies and information flows form practically all social processes faced by modern society. Thanks to built-in microprocessors, algorithmic devices and information systems combine texts, sounds and images that are easily stored and reproduced in digital format. The transfer of mass communication to the Internet has led to the transition of target audiences from traditional media to social networks. Without diminishing the benefits, opportunities and prospects that the digital world opens to humanity, it is necessary to actualize the significance of the negative side of the digital development of mass communication. Digital realities open up new possibilities for the introduction of various manipulation tools, among which misinformation is especially dangerous.
Post-truth interpretation refers to artificial circumstances in which the emotions and personal beliefs of target audiences are more important than objective facts and evidence that become irrelevant, particularly in shaping public opinion and influencing the mass consciousness. Post-truth is not just the opposite of truth, but rather a phenomenon of purposeful introduction of proactive communication, which as a set of different and interconnected actions, due to its recombined qualities and combination of different components misleads recipients of information in order to subdue them. The consequence is a decrease in the level of trust in the received information and media. People are confused, it becomes difficult for them to separate true information from false information, they do not realize what is true and what media can be trusted. The post-truth politics is realized through ""soft"" and gradual transformation of the system of national values and moral principles into so-called alternative ""universal norms of morality"" to absolutize individual freedom, discredit expert opinions and rational discussions, and most importantly to destroy information sovereignty. One of the effective tools for implementing such a policy is gaslighting - a form of organized influence of suggestors (manipulators, politicians, officials) on the processes of public self-identification in order to disorient them and further subdue by provoking uncertainty and doubts about the adequacy of their perception of reality.
Victims of gaslighting no longer trust their values, ideals and beliefs, and in despair they give up and by default fall under the influence of manipulators. Such people do not even realize that they are consumers of misinformation. Global networks are becoming a suitable environment for gas writers, as the constant presence of the vast majority of users on social networks and media channels is caused by the growing level of Internet addiction and digital autism, which create a person first addiction and secondly dangerous state of inability to maintain psychological support. languages with other individuals. That is, the digital transformation of everyday life contributes to the loss of people's communication skills of real communication. The loss of the ability to think adequately, independently and analytically is also negative, because the content and meaning of what is happening around them is formed by social media and digital algorithms of artificial intelligence.
Influencing citizens by external propagandistsâ manipulation means disseminate not only criminal and illegal content through social media, but also directly implement political scenarios of changes in national values, the overthrow of the government, provoke armed conflicts, and so on. Disinformation contributes to a geometrically progressive increase in the incidence of the population, which leads to the introduction by the authorities of some regulatory (remediation) measures that may impair freedom of speech and freedom of expression, restrict freedom of assembly and access to public information.
In order to obtain the necessary parity between the appropriateness of the application of regulatory measures to combat misinformation to protect the right to reliable and lawful information and the exercise of civil liberties (rights to freedom expression), it is necessary to legally define the grounds, limits and criteria limitation. The dissemination of harmful information cannot be overcome post-factum with the help of targeted sanctions, under these conditions rapid preventive measures are needed. In this context, the media play a key role in combating fakes and are accountable to the state and society for failing to provide accurate and reliable information to the public.
Social media units, multinational corporations (digital producers), administrators of social networking platforms, non-governmental organizations and international institutions, civil society and independent media are the subjects of counteraction to the spread of disinformation by social media.
Conclusions and recommendations. The significance of the negative consequences of the digital development of mass communication is actualized, the virtual reality of which opens new possibilities for the introduction of various manipulation tools, among which misinformation carries a special danger. It has been proven that misinformation is successfully disseminated through aggressive information campaigns and lack of knowledge about threats and existing vulnerabilities of society, and more effectively affects target audiences by disrupting the interaction (cooperation and communication) of actors to counter its dissemination at the national and international levels. It is substantiated that modern management processes are formed under the influence of post-truth policy, one of the effective tools of which is gaslighting.
The main factors that contribute to the spread of misinformation through social media are identified: the effectiveness of the impact on the mass consciousness; scale, high speed and rate of distribution; stability of online presence (causes cumulative effect); intentional promotion of content by artificially adding it to disseminated information flows through popular media and resources; high quality, multidimensionality and variety of fake products, which are perfectly combined in the form of texts, images and videos; easy availability, high-tech and convenience of software for creating fakes.
The necessity of disseminating positive Ukrainian narratives by social media as a tool to counteract misinformation and information defense of the country has been proved. It is proposed to involve the best representatives of the Ukrainian elite: patriotic politicians and public figures (opinion leaders), bloggers, volunteers, scientists, cultural and artistic figures for this case.
It is substantiated that state public policy subjects of counteracting disinformation and its dissemination (Center for Counteracting Disinformation of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security of the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine and National Council of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting) flows in the middle of the country, if necessary, applying the necessary remedial action, study the target audiences, identify, analyze and assess their vulnerabilities (public fears, doubts, etc.), predict possible information attacks on Ukraine. It is necessary to constantly cooperate with digital media and mass media through information and communication campaigns.
Practical recommendations were given to state/non-state subjects of counteraction of misinformation on struggle in Ukraine against production of fake content by means of social media. It is necessary:

to create a favorable socio-economic, institutional-legal and information-communicative environment for quality and independent journalism, as well as an independent community of fact-checkers as a form of journalistic control to verify the facts used in texts, speeches, social networks posts and identify possible inconsistencies;
to disseminate accurate, reliable and objective information on the basis of responsible and independent journalism, to prevent the dissemination of fabricated and manipulative content;
to produce positive Ukrainian narratives as a tool of information defense, to prevent the emergence of fakes (instead of refuting fakes - to act in advance), promptly and without explanation to remove/block malicious content in accordance with the law and ""community policy"";
to set requirements for the media platforms transparency (their activities, funding sources, owners), define criteria and algorithms for ranking information, as well as legally and legitimately require social media to remove illegal content and block its distributors;
to monitor, moderate and control the social media content on the basis of legality, transparency and compliance with international human rights standards with the use of means to protect them;
to regulate and control the distribution of advertising on news resources of the media and social media, in particular to ensure verification of the transparency and veracity of its sponsored political content, as well as limit of its targeting in order to minimize the income of disinformation disseminators;
to promote digital services of voluntary users identification in the online space;
to ensure easy, fast and reliable access to all official documents, regulated by the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, ratified by Ukraine in 2020 (Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, 2009);
to delegate to search platforms and social networks to determine the truth/falsity of information using artificial intelligence algorithms, remembering that these algorithms can be used to detect/remove misinformation, and vice versa - to create fake information (for example, to form the necessary public opinion misinformation is directed to a specific target audience, taking into account its features and characteristics through algorithmic analysis of messages on social networks, preferences, a selection of sources of user content);
to ensure that the majority of the population masters the media literacy and cyberhygiene basics, in particular to encourage and promote the introduction of specialized media programs on information and digital literacy for most people to understand the functions and ramifications of artificial intelligence algorithms, the ability to make informed decisions minimize the impact of threats (risks) associated with the use of such systems, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, the media, civil society, educational institutions and scientific and technical institutions.

Approximately 80% of Americans do not meet minimum levels of recommended physical activity. Virtual reality (VR) may improve exercise outcomes by enhancing presence, decreasing perceived exertion, and increasing exercise enjoyment. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of a proprietary VR interface on presence, perceived exertion, and exercise enjoyment during rowing ergometry. METHODS: First, we developed a novel VR software program for rowing ergometry. Subsequently, sixteen apparently healthy, recreationally active individuals (12M, 4F; 35.5 Â± 13.9 y; 174.5 Â± 10.1 cm; 80.4 Â± 12.8 kg; VO2max: 38.1 Â± 5.6 mL/kg/min) were familiarized with the rowing ergometer and VR software, and then completed a VO2max test during two separate sessions. Finally, subjects performed four, 30-min rowing sessions in a randomized, counterbalanced order at maximal voluntary intensity in four different conditions: 1) no augmented visual or audio stimuli (CON), 2) no augmented visual stimuli with self-selected music (MUS), 3) screen-based environmental display (SB), and 4) a virtual reality environment (VR). Presence (Spatial Presence Experience Scale), perceived exertion (Borg 6-20 scale), and enjoyment (Exercise-Induced Feelings Inventory) were assessed using questionnaires. Data (mean Â± SD) were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA and appropriate Tukeyâs post hoc tests. Alpha was set at P \u3c 0.05. RESULTS: Eight of twenty spatial presence items indicated an enhanced experience in VR vs. SB (P \u3c 0.05). Perceived exertion (CON: 14.7 Â± 2.1; MUS: 14.9 Â± 2.0; SB: 15.2 Â± 2.5; VR: 14.9 Â± 1.7) and exercise-induced feelings were not different between conditions (P \u3e 0.05). CONCLUSION: The pilot version of the VR software for rowing ergometry did not reduce perceived exertion or increase exercise enjoyment in recreationally active individuals, although it did facilitate improved user presence compared to a screen-based enhanced environment. Added features, such as better coupling of rowing intensity to boat velocity in VR may further enhance presence and immersion, thereby decreasing perceived exertion and increasing exercise enjoyment",multimedia,130,not included

However the recent emergence of the TCD-TIMIT corpus, with around 6000 words, 59 speakers and seven hours of recorded audio-visual speech, allows the deployment of more recent techniques in audio-speech such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and sequence discriminative training. In this paper we combine the DNN with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to the, so called, hybrid DNN-HMM configuration which we train using a variety of sequence discriminative training methods. This is then followed with a weighted finite state transducer. The conclusion is that the DNN offers very substantial improvement over a conventional classifier which uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model the densities even when optimised with Speaker Adaptive Training. Sequence adaptive training offers further improvements depending on the precise variety employed but those improvements are of the order of ~10\% improvement in word accuracy. Putting these two results together implies that lipreading is moving from something of rather esoteric interest to becoming a practical reality in the foreseeable future",multimedia,134,not included

âOnce memories and dreams, the dead and ghosts become technologically reproducible.â

Friedrich Kittler (1999:11)



Black Mirror (2011-) is a science-fiction television series written by Charlie Brooker and first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK before moving to Netflix in 2016. The show takes an anthology approach, presenting each of its stories as a discrete episode commonly situated in dystopic, near-future settings. The series is orientated around three main themes; (1) the development, use and exploitation of technology, (2) the ethics related to the deployment of this technology by members of the public and corporations, and (3) an exploration of the nature of what constitutes consciousness specifically related to artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technology. It is the third of these themes that this paper addresses, considering how the series presents artificial intelligence as a philosophical discourse within which the implications of the impact of technology on society can be concentrated both in terms of its future and present day applications.



In the first episode of Season Two, Be Right Back (Harris, 2013) this is expressed in a story of the recently widowed Martha (Hayley Atwell), who reconstructs a version of her deceased husband Ash (Domhnall Gleeson) through a machine-based consciousness that draws upon the data created from his lifetime of publicly available digital activity. Initially, Marthaâs interaction with Ashâs AI-self is confined to a text-based chat bot. âThe more it has, the more itâs him,â states Marthaâs friend Sarah, who initially sets up the account and advises that she had communicated with the same software after her own husband died to help mitigate her grief. This exchange prompts Martha to add Ashâs record of emails, still images, audio and video to the dataset that AI-Ash is able to draw upon, the creation of such information a real-world process that Jose Van Dijick and Thomas Poell have described as the âdataficationâ of a life mediated online (2013). 



Now able to communicate with her aurally, AI-Ash gathers more data from Martha as they converse on the phone and she recounts moments that she had spent with her late husband. Eventually, Martha buys a humanoid android clone and imprints upon it Ashâs likeness, allowing AI-Ashâs transition to physical manifestation and to whom Martha provides even more data to the cloud-based storage where AI-Ashâs consciousness is stored. âYou look well,â Martha observes, as Android-Ash emerges from a bath of nutrient gel. âThe photos we keep tend to be flattering,â the android replies, offering the first sense that this embodied self is already inauthentic â encumbered by what Joseph Walther describes as âhyperpersonalâ, or extremely selective, representation of Ashâs self familiar to all users of social media platforms (2011). Despite Marthaâs intentions in continuing life with a new version of her husband, Android-Ash lacks the imperfections that form part of her understanding of his humanness.



This theme of replicating human consciousness through artificial intelligence technologies is presented in a number of Black Mirror episodes, including White Christmas (Tibbetts, 2014), San Junipero (Harris, 2016), U.S.S. Callister (Haynes, 2017) and Black Museum (McCarthy, 2017). As in so much other science fiction, from Frankenstein (Shelley, 1818) to Ex Machina (Garland, 2015), the series uses this notion of questioning the use of the technology to recreate or feign consciousness in order to present a wider discourse around notions of identity, memory and the formulation of the human self and subjectivity.



The artificial intelligence of Be Right Back deviates from the notion of consciousness and identity of these other examples however. As AI-Ashâs consciousness is constructed from fragments of the singular human Ashâs online activity and Marthaâs memories of their interactions, so the AI can only ever hope to represent an augmented reality that can only reflect the mediated nature of Ashâs incomplete digital self. This imperfect copy of the human Ash is a simulacrum, a likeness, unable to ever attain what Martin Heidegger describes as having âan openness-of-beingâ (1977: xxxv).



Despite the AIâs physical existence through the Android-Ash body, the machine intelligence does not meet the Heideggerian definition of âDaseinâ (1977) - determined by being both present within the world and directly relating with it. Instead it is encumbered to constantly adding or adjusting the incomplete digital memory that constitutes AI-Ash. Initially hoping the cyborg will serve as a continuation of her husband, Martha soon becomes frustrated by her engagement with the Android/AI-Ash, realising that her creation is something very different and Other. She begins to understand that AI-Ash can only ever be a simulation or poor substitution of her late husband, as the data from which its consciousness is drawn is by forever destined to remain incomplete. âYou are not enough of himâ, she acknowledges. âYou arenât you [â¦] just a few ripples of you. Thereâs no history to you. Youâre just a performance of stuff that he did without thinking.â



As Ex Machina presented questions as the nature of machine consciousness, Be Right Back offers a more direct critique of the present, rather than the near future. Charlie Brookerâs presentation of the possibility of life after death through artificial intelligence technologies, proposes a more immediate philosophical question. What is the nature of the human self already disrupted by a second life through the engagement with social media and other online technologies? The relationship between AI-Ash and his human counterpart is perhaps closer than Martha realises, with the episode having presented the human Ash as being similarly augmented. He too is disconnected from his reality with Martha - distracted by the draw of his phone and virtual spaces, and subsequently less aware or responsive to his own, real surroundings than his AI simulacrum. As Jean Baudrillard argues, a hyperreality is a substitution of the real with the signs of the real. AI-Ash is, in Baudrillardâs terms, a simulation â âno longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the generation of models of a real without origin or realityâ. Brookerâs insight in this episode is not this representation of an inhuman simulacrum, but rather to comment critically on Ashâs social media present, as Baudrillard describes and as Martha despairs prior to her husbandâs death, as âA hyperspace without atmosphereâ (1983: 1-3).

The need for innovation in this crime combat scene imposes partnerships, support, research and scientific method. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) and K-Means algorithms on real financial transaction databases investigated by Sergipe's LABLDs, comparing the evidences found with the results obtained by mapping the state-of-the-art published in the literature. Method: Initially, a Survey was conducted with the premise of characterizing the use of techniques of storage, integration, Data Mining and Data Analytics by LABLDs and other investigative units throughout Brazil. Then, a systematic mapping was performed as a way to identify and systematize the main approaches, techniques and algorithms used in computer science to combat LD. Finally, a controlled in vivo experiment was designed and executed to compare the EM and K-Means algorithms. Results: It was found that approximately 97% of survey respondents did not directly use any data mining algorithm and that 30.99% evaluated their own knowledge about the subject as bad or very bad. Related to the state of the art, it has been identified that the main approaches used against LD are supervised classifiers and clusters. With the execution of the experimental process, it was evidenced that the algorithm EM surpasses the K-means algorithm, reaching a maximum average accuracy of 98.25%. Conclusions: This thesis exposed a hard reality within the main investigation and control bodies of our country. After analyzing the state of the art, it was evidenced that there are opportunities to explore solutions against LD, especially in the areas of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Finally, the EM algorithm presented as a superior alternative to K-means for the implementation of a predictor module of suspicious transactions, confirming the results of the literature, however, in a real and specific investigation environment.Contexto: Desde 2007, por meio da EstratÃ©gia Nacional de Combate Ã  CorrupÃ§Ã£o e Ã  Lavagem de Dinheiro (ENCCLA), iniciou-se a criaÃ§Ã£o dos primeiros LaboratÃ³rios de Tecnologia contra Lavagem de Dinheiro (LABLDs), os quais, hoje, estÃ£o presentes em todas as regiÃµes da federaÃ§Ã£o e sÃ£o responsÃ¡veis por polÃ­ticas de desenvolvimento de mÃ©todos e tecnologias de ponta para dar suporte aos Ã³rgÃ£os de persecuÃ§Ã£o penal.

Infatti, ora che povertÃ , disuguaglianze, degrado ambientale e umano hanno quasi compromesso la sopravvivenza della vita sulla Terra, la necessitÃ  di perseguire diversi paradigmi di sviluppo, produzione e consumo ha progressivamente catalizzato lâattenzione di un numero crescente di studiosi, professionisti e autoritÃ  di regolazione (nonchÃ¨ della societÃ  in generale), per i quali la definizione di percorsi di cambiamento in grado di invertire le attuali tendenze globali Ã¨ diventata una prioritÃ  di assoluto rilievo.
Nonostante i numerosi eventi internazionali recentemente avvenuti (primo fra tutti lâaccordo sui Sustainable Development Goals da parte delle Nazioni Unite) abbiano consentito di aggiornare le prioritÃ  globali di sostenibilitÃ  alla luce dei mutati scenari mondiali, occorre sottolineare come, accanto alla definizione di nuovi obiettivi di sostenibilitÃ , lâeffettivo perseguimento delle sfide della sostenibilitÃ  debba passare attraverso un maggiore impegno verso la concreta attuazione di tali prioritÃ  da parte di tutti gli attori sociali.
Tra gli attori coinvolti nel processo di transizione verso la sostenibilitÃ , le aziende rivestono certamente un ruolo di primo piano. Gli ultimi anni, infatti, hanno mostrato quanto possano essere devastanti gli effetti di comportamenti aziendali sconsiderati: frodi, violazioni delle norme in materia di lavoro e crescente inquinamento derivante dalle attivitÃ  aziendali rappresentano solo alcuni degli eventi che hanno simboleggiato il fallimento del paradigma aziendale basato sulla massimizzazione del profitto nel creare societÃ  piÃ¹ giuste ed un ambiente naturale piÃ¹ salubre. Tale realtÃ  ha interessato particolarmente le aziende operanti nel settore Agro-alimentare (dati sia il ruolo chiave rivestito dellâagricoltura nel contesto economico globale che le gravi conseguenze sui livelli di approvvigionamento alimentare causate dalle minacce ambientali derivanti dai paradigmi agricoli tradizionali e, piÃ¹ in generale, dalle attuali catene del valore Agro-alimentari) e, tra queste, le aziende multinazionali (data la severitÃ  degli impatti sociali e ambientali derivanti dal loro operato).
La crescente consapevolezza in merito allâinsostenibilitÃ  delle attuali traiettorie di sviluppo aziendale ha pertanto portato sia aziendalisti che operatori a concentrarsi sulla ricerca di costrutti teorici che potessero sintetizzare la necessitÃ  per le aziende di abbracciare aspetti economici, sociali ed ambientali nei loro core business da un punto di vista integrato, con la conseguenza che molti concetti promuoventi lâadozione dei principi di sostenibilitÃ  a livello aziendale sono apparsi in letteratura nel corso degli anni. Tuttavia, la maggior parte di tali concetti Ã¨ sembrata (e sembra tuttora) soffrire della mancanza di una visione integrata in merito alle diverse dimensioni della sostenibilitÃ . Eâ in questo contesto che il concetto di Corporate Sustainability, concepito come la massima espressione dellâintegrazione tra le dimensioni di sostenibilitÃ  all'interno delle aziende, si Ã¨ gradualmente affermato.
Lâavvento della Corporate Sustainability, a sua volta, ha fatto emergere la necessitÃ  di cambiare progressivamente il modo in cui le aziende pensano a ciÃ² che producono, a come producono ciÃ² che esse producono, nonchÃ¨ agli effetti che le loro attivitÃ  hanno sulla societÃ  e l'ambiente, spingendo il mondo accademico a concentrarsi sul concetto di Modello di Business ed, in particolare, a mettere in discussione lâadeguatezza degli attuali Modelli di Business, accusati di non tenere debitamente in considerazione lâimpatto degli aspetti sociali e ambientali sulla creazione di valore. In particolare, la necessitÃ  di concettualizzare Modelli di Business integranti al loro interno aspetti economici, sociali e ambientali ha fatto sÃ¬ che il termine Modello di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  si affermasse, non certo senza difficoltÃ . Il concetto di Modello di Business Ã¨ infatti di per sÃ© stato (ed Ã¨ tuttora) oggetto di molteplici definizioni, che hanno portato ad un disaccordo generale su quale sia lâesatto significato del termine. Tale disaccordo si Ã¨ successivamente spostato al concetto di Modello di Business per la SostenibilitÃ , come dimostrato dalle diverse concettualizzazioni attraverso i quali il termine Ã¨ stato definito nel corso del tempo.
Il disaccordo esistente in merito a quale sia la definizione esatta del termine Modello di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  non ha tuttavia indebolito la necessitÃ  di allontanarsi dalle attuali traiettorie di sviluppo aziendale per abbracciare un nuovo modo di pensare alle aziende, un modo secondo cui esse sono considerate come un elemento in grado di migliorare le condizioni sociali e ambientali mantenendo, allo stesso tempo, adeguati livelli di redditivitÃ . Al contrario, questo ha avuto importanti conseguenze in termini di ricerca: piuttosto che concentrarsi sullâelaborazione di specifiche e precise definizioni a priori di Modello di Business per la SostenibilitÃ , infatti, una parte della letteratura ha cominciato a concentrarsi sul processo di transizione dai Modelli di Business âtradizionaliâ ai Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  (con una particolare attenzione al ruolo svolto dall'innovazione), nonchÃ© sulle possibili tipologie di Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  che tale processo puÃ² originare. Inoltre, accanto alla necessitÃ  di mappare i principali cambiamenti per la sostenibilitÃ  allâinterno dei Modelli di Business, Ã¨ emerso il bisogno di allineare i Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  con le rispettive strategie, bisogno che ha dato origine ad un interessante filone di ricerca allâinterno della Corporate Sustainability. Nonostante strategia e Modello di Business siano ormai considerati come due concetti distinti, infatti, Ã¨ stata messa in luce una forte correlazione tra essi.
Una volta emersa lâimportanza di allineare Modelli di Business e strategie di sostenibilitÃ , Ã¨ stata evidenziata la necessitÃ  di individuare quegli elementi in grado di favorire tale allineamento. In questo senso, la letteratura ha mostrato come i sistemi di ContabilitÃ  Direzionale e, in particolare, i Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione rivestano un ruolo chiave sia nella formulazione che nellâattuazione delle strategie di sostenibilitÃ . Tuttavia, mentre il rapporto tra Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione e strategie di sostenibilitÃ  Ã¨ stato ampiamente analizzato in letteratura (e importanti risultati di ricerca sono stati raggiunti in questo senso), il rapporto tra Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione e Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  risulta essere stato trascurato. Come sopra accennato, tuttavia, la stessa letteratura sembra essere concordare sempre piÃ¹ sul fatto che la corretta formulazione ed attuazione di strategie di sostenibilitÃ  debba essere accompagnata da modifiche coerenti nei Modelli di Business o, in altre parole, che i cambiamenti nelle strategie e nei Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  debbano essere allineati tra loro, soprattutto con riferimento al grado di incorporazione degli aspetti di sostenibilitÃ . Pertanto, il ruolo che i Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione hanno nellâallineare strategie e Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ  dovrebbe essere analizzato in maniera piÃ¹ approfondita.
Date tali premesse, il presente lavoro esplora il ruolo svolto dai Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione nellâallineare strategie e Modelli di Business per la SostenibilitÃ , attraverso un caso di studio su Barilla, multinazionale italiana operante nel settore Agro-alimentare. Dopo una breve introduzione sugli obiettivi e le motivazioni sottostanti alla ricerca (Capitolo 1), in particolare, lâelaborato offre una panoramica sullo sviluppo storico del concetto di sostenibilitÃ  (capitolo 2), per poi esplorare l'evoluzione del concetto di Corporate Sustainability (Capitolo 3) e successivamente analizzare il concetto di Modello di Business per la SostenibilitÃ , mettendo altresÃ¬ in evidenza i suoi rapporti con quello di strategia di sostenibilitÃ  (Capitolo 4). Dopo aver fornito una panoramica sui temi della ContabilitÃ  Direzionale e del Controllo di Gestione per la sostenibilitÃ  (capitolo 5), lâelaborato illustra la metodologia (interpretativa) e il metodo (caso di studio) impiegati nel presente lavoro (Capitolo 6), per poi presentare il caso di studio Barilla, ed infine proporre alcune osservazioni conclusive, evidenziando i contributi principali e le limitazioni dello studio (capitolo 7).
Dal punto di vista del contributo scientifico, il lavoro mostra come, nel caso di studio ha analizzato, anche se il Sistema di Controllo di Gestione ha contribuito all'allineamento tra Modello di Business e strategia di sostenibilitÃ , lâentitÃ  di tale contributo Ã¨ stata limitata dalla carenza di integrazione tra strumenti di controllo âtradizionaliâ e strumenti orientati alla sostenibilitÃ  (cioÃ¨ specificamente progettati per monitorare gli aspetti di sostenibilitÃ ). Pertanto, in questo senso il lavoro mira a contribuire a quel filone di ricerca sul tema del Controllo di Gestione che suggerisce come, al fine di perseguire efficacemente la sostenibilitÃ , i Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione debbano evolversi, attraverso una migliore integrazione fra aspetti economici, ambientali e sociali, nonchÃ© evidenziando e misurando in modo piÃ¹ chiaro i trade-offs (tipici del concetto di Corporate Sustainability) spesso esistenti tra questi aspetti.
Come noto, l'adozione di un approccio qualitativo non consente di ottenere risultati statisticamente generalizzabili, poichÃ© il suo scopo principale Ã¨ quello di descrivere in dettaglio ed interpretare fenomeni sociali, senza fornire tuttavia modelli predittivi ed esplicativi. Inoltre, i risultati dello studio potrebbero essere influenzati dalla definizione di Modello di Business scelta. Come ampiamente illustrato nel lavoro, infatti, sono molte le definizioni di Modello di Business presenti in letteratura, e anche se la definizione di Modello di Business scelta Ã¨ considerata ârobustaâ dalla letteratura, la scelta di una diversa definizione potrebbe portare a risultati diversi. Occorre tuttavia sottolineare come sia la stessa letteratura a suggerire, data lâeterogeneitÃ  nelle definizioni di Modello di Business, di scegliere la definizione piÃ¹ adatta a rispondere alla domanda di ricerca. In questo senso, si segnala come ulteriori analisi potrebbero esplorare il ruolo dei Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione nellâallineare Modelli di Business e strategie di sostenibilitÃ  in altre aziende, anche operanti in settori differenti, consentendo di confrontare i risultati emergenti dai vari casi di studio ed eventualmente rafforzare le evidenze fornite dal caso di studio oggetto del presente lavoro.
There is little doubt that sustainability represents one the greatest imperatives of the 21st century. In fact, now that poverty, inequality, environmental and human degradation have almost compromised the survival of life on Earth, the need to pursue different paradigms of development, production and consumption have progressively catalyzed the attention of a growing number of academics, practitioners and regulators (as well as society as a whole), to whom the definition of pathways of change able to reverse current global trends has become an absolute priority.
Despite several international events that have recently taken place (first of all the agreement on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) made possible to update global sustainability priorities in the light of changed scenarios, it must be underlined that, alongside the definition of new sustainability goals, the effective tackling of sustainability challenges should pass through a greater commitment to the concrete implementation of such priorities by all societal actors.
Among the actors involved in the process of transition towards sustainability, companies certainly play a prominent role. Recent years, in fact, have shown how devastating the effects of reckless corporate behavior can be: frauds, breach of work regulations, as well as increasing pollution caused by corporate activities represent just some of the events that symbolized the failure of profit maximization-oriented paradigm in creating fairer societies and healthier natural environment. Such reality has particularly affected companies operating in the Agri-food sector (given both the key role played by agriculture in the global economic scenario and the serious consequences on food supply levels caused by environmental threats deriving from traditional agricultural paradigms and, more generally, from current Agri-food value chains) and, among these, multinational companies (given the severity of social and environmental impacts deriving from their operate).
Growing awareness of unsustainability of Business-As-Usual trajectories led both business academics and practitioners to focus their efforts on the research of theoretical constructs that could synthetize the need for companies to embrace economic, social and environmental issues in their core business from an integrated standpoint, with the consequence that many concepts promoting the adoption of sustainability principles at company level appeared in literature over the years. However, the majority of such concepts seemed (and seems) to suffer of a lack of an integrated view about different sustainability dimensions. It is moving from this context that the concept of Corporate Sustainability, as the fullest expression of the integration between sustainability dimensions within companies, gradually established itself.
The advent of Corporate Sustainability, in turn, made emerge the need for a progressive change in the way in which companies think about what they produce, how they produce what they produce, as well as about the effects that their activities have on society and environment, leading scholarly efforts to focus on the concept of Business Model and, in particular, to question the adequacy of the existing Business Models, accused to do not take into consideration the impact of social and environmental aspects in the creation of value appropriately. In particular, the need to conceptualize Business Models in which social and environmental aspects are fully integrated with economic ones made emerge the term Business Model for Sustainability, certainly not without difficulties. The concept of Business Model per se has in fact been subject to multiple definitions over time, leading to a general disagreement about its exact meaning. Such disagreement has then subsequently shifted to the concept of Business Model for Sustainability, as showed by several conceptualizations through which the term has been defined over time.
Disagreement over the exact definition of Business Model for Sustainability, however, have not weakened the need to move away from Business-As-Usual trajectories in order to embrace a new way of thinking about companies, a way according to which companies are considered as a factor able to improve societal and environmental conditions keeping, at the same time, adequate profitability levels. On the contrary, this had important consequence in terms of research: rather than focusing on the elaboration of specific and precise a priori definitions of Business Model for Sustainability, in fact, an always more consistent part of the literature has begun to focus on the process of transition from âtraditionalâ Business Models to Business Models for Sustainability (with a particular emphasis on the role played by innovation), as well as on possible typologies of Business Models for Sustainability that this process could originate. Moreover, alongside the need to map main changes towards sustainability in Business Models, the need to align Business Models for Sustainability with sustainability strategies emerged, originating an interesting field of research within Corporate Sustainability area. Despite strategy and Business Model are now considered as two distinct concepts, in fact, a close relationship between them has been highlighted by several authors.
Once the importance of aligning Business Model and strategy for sustainability has been highlighted, the need to individuate the elements that can favor such alignment emerged. In this sense, literature has showed that Management Accounting and, above all, Management Control Systems can play a key role both in formulation and implementation of sustainability strategies. Nevertheless, while the relationship between Management Control Systems and sustainability strategies has been extensively explored (and important research results have been achieved in this sense), the relationship between Management Control Systems and Business Models for Sustainability seems to be underexplored in literature. As above mentioned, however, the same literature seems to increasingly agree on the fact that the appropriate formulation and implementation of sustainability strategies should be accompanied by consistent changes in the Business Models or, in other words, changes in strategies and Business Models for Sustainability should be aligned between them, especially in terms of the degree of incorporation of sustainability issues. Therefore, the analysis of the role that Management Control Systems have in the implementation of Business Models for Sustainability and, above all, that of the role that Management Control Systems have in aligning strategies and Business Models for Sustainability should be analysed in more detail.
Given this premise, this work explores the role played by Management Control Systems in aligning sustainability strategies and Business Models for Sustainability. To do this, a case study on Barilla, an Italian multinational company operating in Agri-food sector, has been conducted. After a brief introduction to the objectives and motivations for the research (Chapter 1), in particular, the work provides an overview on the historical development of sustainability concept (Chapter 2), to then explore the evolution of the concept of Corporate Sustainability (Chapter 3) and analyse the concept of Business Model for Sustainability, highlighting its relationships with that of sustainability strategy (Chapter 4). Subsequently, after having provided an overview on Management Accounting and Control for sustainability (Chapter 5), methodology (interpretive) and method (case study) employed in the present work are illustrated (Chapter 6). Finally, after having presented the case study on Barilla, some concluding remarks are provided, and main contributions and limitations of the study are highlighted (Chapter 7).
In terms of scientific contributions, the work shows that, in the case study analysed, although the Management Control System contributed to the alignment between Business Model and sustainability strategy, the magnitude of such contribution was limited by the lack of integration between âtraditionalâ management control tools and sustainability-oriented ones (specifically designed to monitor aspects of sustainability). Therefore, in this sense the work aims at contributing to that stream of Management Control research suggesting that, in order to effectively pursue sustainability, Management Control Systems must evolve, by better integrating economic, environmental and social aspects between them, as well as by highlighting and measuring trade-offs (typical of Corporate Sustainability concept) often existing between these aspects in a clearer way.
As known, the adoption of a qualitative approach does not allow to obtain statistically-generalizable results, since main aim of such approach is that of describing in detail, understanding and interpreting social phenomena without providing, however, predictive or explanatory models. Moreover, results of the study may be affected by the definition of Business Model chosen. As widely illustrated in the work, in fact, there are many definitions of Business Model in literature, and even if the definition of Business Model selected is considered a ârobustâ one, choosing a different definition could lead to different results. However, it must be underlined that is the same literature to suggest, given the heterogeneity in existing definitions, to choose the most suitable definition of Business Model to answer the research question. In this sense, further analyses could explore the role of Management Control Systems in aligning Business Models for Sustainability and sustainability strategies in other companies, also operating in different sectors, allowing to compare results emerging from various case studies, and eventually strengthening evidence provided by the case study object of the present work",science,140,not included

Machine Learning itself has been around for some decades â essentially pattern-recognition software that requires very substantial computing resources, which were, until very recently, mostly theoretical and hard to come by.  Machine Learning was one avenue of the field of Artificial Intelligence known as Narrow A.I. â the kind of âartificial intelligenceâ that was strictly limited in scope as a first-steps starting point of what came, as a result, to be known as General A.I.  General A.I., known then as simply, âArtificial Intelligenceâ, was the 1950s dream that brought us such things as Robbie the Robot, and more recently C3PO, and The Terminator: the kind of science fiction characters that remain the only manifestations of General Artificial Intelligence.



âDeep Learningâ also continues engineeringâs 1940s trend of using language in a way that I will contest in this paper: a co-opting of words that have been used, in the past, to describe human activities, using them instead to describe what engineers have managed to make machines do.  These co-optations reduce the richness of the word, making its referent an algorithm: a flow diagram that represents the bare essentials of what an engineer can understand and reproduce of a human activity; not the human activity itself.  This diagram of the âengineering possibleâ over-simplifies the human activity it tries to depict.   With continued usage, the meaning of the word for us today has all-too-often become reduced to what the engineer has newly defined it to mean: something much less than it once was.  



In this paper I propose to attempt to roll back some of these co-optations, and to re-introduce some of the richness of the words that have been taken by engineering.  I shall examine Turingâs seminal paper on the notion of a thinking machine.  I shall be using the philosophical insights of Henri Bergson, especially in his book, Matter and Memory, and the discoveries of neuroscience and complexity scientists. I will try to show that the answer to Turingâs question, âCan machines think?â remains a resounding, âNo!â, and that notions such as âdeep learningâ are in fact not only an inaccurate use of the very human experience of learning, but degrade the latter in using such a term",robotics,142,not included

However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving.

For instance, an aggressive driver may prefer driving with high acceleration whereas some conservative drivers prefer a safer driving style. Therefore, we propose an apprenticeship learning in combination with deep reinforcement learning approach that allows the agent to learn the driving and stopping behaviors with continuous actions. We use gradient inverse reinforcement learning (GIRL) algorithm to recover the unknown reward function and employ REINFORCE as well as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to learn the optimal policy.

vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities

studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and
illumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the
interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the
UAVs, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target
area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an
optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association,
and power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication
requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the
machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional

long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future
illumination distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution,
the original nonconvex optimization problem can be divided into two
sub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative algorithm.

  communications enabled uavs",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07554v1,"In this paper, the problem of optimizing the deployment of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities is
studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide
communications and illumination to service ground users. Ambient illumination
increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination
threshold of the UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination
distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem
is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total
transmit power while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of
users. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the machine learning
framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed. Using GRUs, the UAVs can
model the long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future
illumination distribution. In order to reduce the complexity of the prediction
algorithm while accurately predicting the illumination distribution, a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is used to fit the illumination distribution of the target
area at each time slot. Based on the predicted illumination distribution, the
optimization problem is proved to be a convex optimization problem that can be
solved by using duality. Simulations using real data from the Earth
observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can
achieve up to 22.1% reduction in transmit power compared to a conventional
optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution.
The results also show that UAVs must hover at areas having strong illumination,
thus providing useful guidelines on the deployment of VLC-enabled UAVs.",autonomous vehicle,159,not included

driving styles vary a lot among the different users. For instance, an
aggressive driver may prefer driving with high acceleration whereas some

Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1Â cm and 0.5Â cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the water-logged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect.

The current study presents two implementations of the multiple-expert colour feature extreme learning machine (MEC-ELM). The MEC-ELM is a cascading algorithm that has been implemented along side a summed area table (SAT) for fast feature extraction and object classification, for a fully functioning object detection algorithm. The MEC-ELM is an implementation of the colour feature extreme learning machine (CF-ELM), which is an extreme learning machine (ELM) with a partially connected hidden layer; taking three colour bands as inputs. The colour implementation used with the SAT enable the MEC-ELM to find and classify objects quickly, with 84% precision and 91% recall in weed detection in the YâUV colour space and in 0.5â¯s per frame. The colour implementation is however limited to low resolution images and for this reason a colour level co-occurrence matrix (CLCM) variant of the MEC-ELM is proposed. This variant uses the SAT to produce a CLCM and texture analyses, with texture values processed as an input to the MEC-ELM. This enabled the MEC-ELM to achieve 78â85% precision and 81â93% recall in cattle, weed and quad bike detection and in times between 1 and 2â¯s per frame.

Capturing and defining scenarios/edge cases, various and heterogenous datasets, multiple sensors/sensorfusion architectures, and perception algorithms are just a few of the many challenges we are facing when implementing such systems. To cope with such levels of complexity, modular approaches are required. Such approaches target flexibility and standardized interfaces between data provided by various sensor modules/models and driving functions. In the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain, and more precisely when dealing with supervised training of Neural Networks (NN), obtaining valid and accurately labeled datasets is essential. By enabling Machine Learning (ML) in electromagnetic applications, Ansys physics-based Real Time Radar (RTR) introduces a new paradigm for sensor development and integration that leverages GPU hardware and new algorithms to accelerate simulation by orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. In this paper, a comprehensive workflow for the generation of virtual datasets using the Open Simulation Interface (OSI) will be presented. This workflow will illustrate how the scenario variation process coupled with RTR facilitates the creation of heterogenous/labeled datasets that are ready for training object detection NN. Finally, this presentation will also show the preliminary results obtained when implementing this process. Introduction Machine Learning (ML) is gradually taking over âconventionalâ algorithms that were previously designed to help make Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) a reality. Several auto giants like BMW, VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 83 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19.

Others, like Tesla [1] are solely relying on ML and in some cases Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide an end-to-end solution. AVs usually rely on several sensors of different types to perceive their surrounding environment. As such sensors continuously scan the environment and generate raw data, the perception stack processes this data and generates a meaningful virtual map of the surrounding environment. In the area of Computer Vision (CV), usually relying on optical systems, ML algorithms are already successfully deployed in commercial systems [2] â [4]. In addition to optical systems, and due to their superior performances in bad weather conditions and dark environments, radars have also made their way into the AVâs sensor stacks. Though not frequently encountered, ML has also been used to replace some of the traditional radar signal processing algorithms. For example, in [5] the author demonstrates how a fully convolutional network can be used for object detection and 3D estimation using a Frequency-Modulated ContinuousWave (FMCW) radar. Contrary to [5], which is using real data for the training process, the author in [6] illustrates the power of physics-based simulation to also demonstrate the feasibility of using ML approaches to solve radar-based perception problems. As the training process of ML algorithms highly relies on labeled training data, Ansysâ Real Time Radar (RTR) automates generation of labeled data sets by shifting data generation and labeling from the real world to the virtual world. In addition, having an API which is compatible with the Open Simulation Interface (OSI) [7] ensures that a standardized interface is being deployed to describe the virtual environment in which generated scenarios are executed. Finally, this paper illustrates how, with the help of Ansys optiSlang [8], a tool chain is developed to orchestrate the scenario variation process and the simulation workflow to automatically generate labeled datasets for training a Neural Network (NN) based object detection algorithm. Ansys Real Time Radar RTR is an all-GPU implementation of the shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) method optimized for the automotive radar application to simulate a scenario in real time/faster than real time. The simulation, which is based on an arbitrary 3D scene/actor geometry, electrical material VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 84 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19.

As an output, RTR can generate raw I and I+Q A/D data for multi-channel radars in dynamically changing driving scenarios. Objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, road, infrastructure, etc.) can be assigned arbitrary positions, orientations, linear and angular velocities in a scene graph hierarchy through a light-weight API to characterize complex traffic scenarios with negligible simulation overhead. To measure Doppler velocity, automotive radars transmit, receive, and process hundreds of chirps over each Coherent Processing Interval (CPI). Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) and several post processing algorithms are then applied to hundreds of samples from each chirp/CPI to obtain range-Doppler (RD) images, which will be used for Neural Network (NN) training. These images, as represented in Fig. 1, give a visualization of all scattered fields in terms of relative velocity (Doppler) and distance from the radar (range). Fig. 1: Example of Range-Doppler image. As previously mentioned, RTR includes a lightweight C++ and Python API, enabling it to be integrated into nearly any driving simulator available on the market. In Fig. 2 the APIâs main interfaces are depicted. VDI-Berichte Nr. 2384, 2021 85 https://doi.org/10.51202/9783181023846-83 Generiert durch IP '54.190.42.255', am 08.11.2021, 13:26:19.

Starting from left to right, the API give the user access to the following: 1. âRadar Configâ enables the user to configure radar waveforms, radar modes, and antenna patterns. Radar waveforms are defined by parameters such as center frequency, bandwidth, number of frequency samples, CPI duration, number of chirps, number of transmit and receive antennas, and relative antenna positions. 2. âObject and Materialsâ helps the user build the 3D environment to be simulated and assign dielectric material properties. For example, as presented in Fig. 3, a vehicle can be imported as a set of subcomponents. Users can assign appropriate material properties for each component.

Fig. 3: Vehicle subcomponents featuring adequate assignment of material properties. 3. âObject Velocitiesâ represents scene dynamics where position and velocity updates are provided at each simulation time step. Such data is usually obtained from any driving simulator or from a set of pre-recorded/measured GPS/IMU data. At each time step, RTR executes a physics-based radar simulation of the scene and returns either the RD data per channel or the raw I/Q channel data (post A/D conversion). Open Simulation Interface To ensure modularity and interchangeability, RTRâs inputs have been adapted to support OSI. Focusing on environment perception and automated driving functions, OSI is an interface specification for models and components of distributed simulation. It defines a generic interface that ensures modularity, interoperability, and integration of simulation frameworkâs individual components. In addition, OSI was developed to address and align with the emerging standard for communication interfaces of real sensors, ISO 23150 [9]. This will eventually ensure a better correlation between communication interfaces used in both virtual and real worlds. Corresponding to OSIâs message description, the OSI:SensorView message represented in Fig. 4 contains the ground truth data that can be generated by any 3rd party driving simulator. The message includes information about the states of dynamic and static actors.

Scenario Variation Neural Networks (NN) are designed to behave as low bias and high variance machines that can perform extremely well on training data. To generalize such machines to new environments, heterogeneous datasets are essential for the training process. Using Ansys optiSlang, scenario variations were generated based on a predefined set of parameters. As represented in Table 1, a set of three parameters were chosen.

WSNs have therefore been a major focus of research over the past 20 years. While WSNs offer a persuasive solution for accurate real-time sensing of the physical world, they are yet to be as ubiquitous as originally predicted when the technology was first envisaged. Technical difficulties exist which have inhibited the anticipated uptake in WSN technologies. The most challenging of these have been identified as system reliability, battery lifetime, maintenance requirements, node size and ease of use. Over the past decade, the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) group at the Tyndall National Institute, has been at the forefront of driving the vision of ubiquitously deployed, extended lifetime, low power consumption embedded systems providing information rich data streams wirelessly in (close to) real-time. In this time, the WSN group has developed multiple novel, first of kind, wireless multi-sensor systems and deployed these in the world around us, overcoming the technical challenges associated with ensuring robust and reliable long-term data sets from our environment. This work is focused on investigating and addressing these challenges through the development of the new technologies and system integration methodologies required to facilitate and implement WSNs and validate these in real deployments. Specifically, discussed are the development and deployment of novel WSN systems in the built environment, environmental monitoring and fitness and health monitoring systems.The key research challenges identified and discussed are:a)The development of resource-constrained, extremely low power consumption systems incorporating energy-efficient hardware and software algorithms.b)The development of highly reliable extremely long duration deployments which through the use of appropriate energy harvesting solutions facilitate (near) zero maintenance sensor networks.c)The development of low power consumption miniaturized wearable microsysteThe development of technologies to address these challenges in terms of cost, size, power consumption and reliability which need to be tested and validated in real world deployments of wireless sensing systems is discussed. It is clear that when looking at the scale up of deployments of novel WSNs, that to be successful, such systems need to ""be invisible, last forever, cost nothing and work out of the box"".

Model accuracy, limited data for calibration, and simulation assumptions limit the validity of evaluation results. One alternative approach is to use emerging hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing methods. HIL test environments enable physical test vehicles to interact with virtual vehicles from traffic simulation models, providing an evaluation environment that can replicate deployment conditions at early stages of CAV technology implementation without incurring excessive costs related to large field tests. In this study, a HIL testing system for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) CAV applications is developed. The involved software and hardware includes a physical CAV controlled in real time, a traffic signal controller, communication devices, and a traffic simulator (VISSIM). Such HIL systems increase validity by considering the physical vehicleâs trajectoriesâwhich are constrained by real-world factors such as GPS accuracy, communication delay, and vehicle dynamicsâin a simulated traffic environment. The developed HIL system is applied to test a representative early deployment CAV application: queue-aware signalized intersection approach and departure (Q-SIAD). The Q-SIAD algorithm generates recommended speed profiles based on the vehicleâs status, signal phase and timing (SPaT), downstream queue length, and system constraints and parameters (e.g., maximum acceleration and deceleration). The algorithm also considers the status of other vehicles in designing the speed profiles. The experiment successfully demonstrated this functionality with one test CAV driving through one intersection controlled by a fixed-timing traffic signal under various simulated traffic conditions.",autonomous vehicle,173,not included

Integrating and evolving these systems becomes complex. Traditional approaches rely on low-level messaging technologies, delegating much of the message interpretation and information management services to application logic. This complicates system integration because different applications could use inconsistent interpretations and implementations of information-management services, such as detecting component presence, state management, reliability and availability of the information, handling of component failures, etc. Integrating modern systems requires a new, modular network-centric approach that avoids these historic problems by relying on standard APIs and protocols that provide stronger information-management services. For example, many of these systems are heterogeneous, mixing a variety of computer hardware, operating systems, and programming languages. Developers often use Java, .NET, or web-scripting to develop consoles and other GUI-oriented applications, and C or C++ for specialized hardware, device drivers, and performanceor time-critical applications. The end system might mix computers running Windows, Linux, and other operating systems, such as Mac OS X, Android, or real-time operating systems like VxWorks and INTEGRITY. The use of standard APIs and interoperable protocols allows all these systems to be easily integrated and deployed. Today, these systems are typically developed using a service-oriented approach and integrated using standards-based middleware APIs such as DDS, JMS, and CORBA, and protocols such as DDS-RTPS, Web-Services/SOAP, REST/HTTP, AMQP, and CORBA/IIOP. This whitepaper focuses on âreal-worldâ systems, that is, systems that interact with the external physical world and must live within the constraints imposed by real-world physics. Good examples include air-traffic control systems, real-time stock trading, command and control (C2) systems, unmanned vehicles, robotic and vetronics, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. More and more these âreal-worldâ systems are integrated using a Data-Centric PublishSubscribe approach, specifically the programming model defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification. This whitepaper describes the basic characteristics of real-world systems programming, reasons why DDS is the best standard middleware technology to use to integrate these systems, and a set of âbest practicesâ guidelines that should be applied when using DDS to implement these systems. Best-Practices Data-Centric Programming: Using DDS to Integrate Real-World Systems November 2010 4 Â© 2010 Real-Time Innovations Real-World Systems Programming Real-World systems refer to a class of software systems that operate continuously and interact directly with real-world objects, such as aircraft, trains, stock transactions, weapons, robotic and manufacturing equipment, etc. Unlike systems involving only humans and computers, real-world systems have to live within the constraints imposed by the physics of the external world. Notably, time cannot be slowed, paused, or reversed. The implication is that these systems must be able to handle the information at the pace it arrives at, as well as be robust to changes in the operating environment. In addition to these environmental considerations, the nature of typical real-world applications also places demands on their availability and need to continue operating even in the presence of partial failures. In order to interact with the real world, software must include a reasonable, if simplified, model of the external world. This model typically includes aspects of the âstate of the worldâ relevant to system operations. Here the word âstateâ is used in the normal sense in software modeling and programming. State summarizes the past inputs to the system from its initial state and contains all the information necessary for a system or program to know how it should react to future events or inputs. Imagine that a new component or application starts and joins a system. The âstate of the systemâ contains the information that this new component needs to acquire before it is ready to start performing its function. A typical component would normally only need access to a subset of that state, the portion that directly affects its operation. For example, in an air-traffic management problem, the relevant aspects of the state of the world might include the current location and trajectory of every aircraft, the flight plans of all flights within a 24-hour window, specific details on each aircraft (type, airline, crew), etc. Once a software component or subsystem is running, it interacts with other components by exposing part of its state, notifying other components when its state changes, and invoking operations on (or sending messages to) other components. Each component reacts to these information exchanges by updating its internal model of the world and using that to perform its necessary actions. Defining a Data Model A data model is simply an organized description of the state of the system. Thus, it includes data types, processes for transferring and updating those types, and methods for accessing the data. It does not typically include functions that can alter the data or (importantly) the application-level logic that affects the data. Governance organizations and system integrators often start their design by designing the system data-model. There are good reasons for this approach: â¢ A data model provides governance across disparate teams and organizations, allowing components developed at different points in time by different organizations to be integrated. This makes it an ideal starting point for a central design or governance authority. Best-Practices Data-Centric Programming: Using DDS to Integrate Real-World Systems November 2010 5 Â© 2010 Real-Time Innovations â¢ A data model represents the better understood, more invariant aspects of the system. Typically the data model is grounded in the âphysics of the system.â That is, it describes the kinds of objects and sensors it manages (like aircraft locations, flight plans, and vehicle positions). The data model is not strongly tied to applicationspecific use cases (e.g., the possible fields in a flight plan are a consequence of the nature of aircraft flight); this makes the data model a good starting point, since the full set of use cases might not be well known in advance or might be the responsibility of a different team. â¢ A data model increases decoupling between systems and components. The data model is grounded in the essential information present in the system and it does not depend so much on the use cases that access the information. For example, an airtraffic control model might include a definition of a âflight plan,â but not whether it is automatically generated using an optimization algorithm, checked for collisions, or altered in mid-flight. Using the data model as the basis for the integration avoids over-constraining the design, leaving it open to allow future evolution and use cases. Contrast this with a design based on defining service invocation APIs which are intimately tied to the details of each service and are likely to change as new use cases are incorporated Example Data Model Imagine designing a simple âchatâ application. The underlying Data-Model could be defined to contain four kinds of objects summarized in the table below: Object Kind Key Fields Other Fields Description Person EmailAddress Name, Loc",autonomous vehicle,175,not included

The opportunities afforded by being able to program networks of small, lightweight, low-power, computation- and bandwidth-limited nodes have attracted a large community of researchers and developers. However, the unique set of capabilities offered by the technology produces an exciting but complex design space, which is often difficult to negotiate in an application context. Deploying sensing physical environments produces its own set of challenges, and can push systems into failure modes, thus revealing problems that can be difficult to discover or reproduce in simulation or the laboratory. Sustained efforts in the area of wireless networked sensing over the last 15 years have resulted in a large number of theoretical developments, substantial practical achievements, and a wealth of lessons for the future. It is clear that in order to bridge the gap between (on the one hand) visions of very large scale, autonomous, randomly deployed networks and (on the other) the actual performance of fielded systems, we need to view deployment as an essential component in the process of developing sensor networks: a process that includes hardware and software solutions that serve specific applications and end-user needs. Incorporating deployment into the design process reveals a new and different set of requirements and considerations, whose solutions require innovative thinking, multidisciplinary teams and strong involvement from end-user communities. This special feature uncovers and documents some of the hurdles encountered and solutions offered by experimental scientists when deploying and evaluating wireless sensor networks in situ, in a variety of well specified application scenarios. The papers specifically address issues of generic importance for WSN system designers: (i) data quality, (ii) communications availability and quality, (iii) alternative, low-energy sensing modalities and (iv) system solutions with high end-user added value and cost benefits. The common thread is deployment and deployment evaluation. In particular, satisfaction of application requirements, involvement of the end-user in the design and deployment process, satisfactory system performance and user acceptance are concerns addressed in many of the contributions. The contributions form a valuable set, which help to identify the priorities for research in this burgeoning area: Robust, reliable and efficient data collection in embedded wireless multi-hop networks are essential elements in creating a true deploy-and-forget user experience. Maintaining full connectivity within a WSN, in a real world environment populated by other WSNs, WiFi networks or Bluetooth devices that constitute sources of interference is a key element in any application, but more so for those that are safety-critical, such as disaster response. Awareness of the effects of wireless channel, physical position and line-of-sight on received signal strength in real-world, outdoor environments will shape the design of many outdoor applications. Thus, the quantification of such effects is valuable knowledge for designers. Sensors' failure detection, scalability and commercialization are common challenges in many long-term monitoring applications; transferable solutions are evidenced here in the context of pollutant detection and water quality. Innovative, alternative thinking is often needed to achieve the desired long-lived networks when power-hungry sensors are foreseen components; in some instances, the very problems of wireless technology, such as RF irregularity, can be transformed into advantages. The importance of an iterative design and evaluation methodologyâfrom analysis to simulation to real-life deploymentâshould be well understood by all WSN developers. The value of this is highlighted in the context of a challenging WPAN video-surveillance application based on a novel Nomadic Access Mechanism. Cost benefits to be drawn from devising a WSN based solution to classic application areas such as surveillance are often a prime motivator for WSN designers; an example is offered here based on the use of intelligent agents for intrusion monitoring. Last but not least, the practicality and usability of the WSN solutions found for novel applications is key to their adoption. This is particularly true when the end-users of the developed technology are medical patients. The importance of feedback, elegant hardware encapsulation and extraction of meaning from data is presented in the context of novel orthopedic rehabilitation aids. Overall, this feature offers wide coverage of most issues encountered in the process of design, implementation and evaluation of deployable WSN systems. We trust that designers and developers of WSN systems will find much work of value, ranging from lessons learned, through solutions to known hurdles, to novel developments that enhance applications.

A key next direction is field studies at industry partner sites to examine real-world workplaces. We propose to develop innovative Internet of Things (IoT) techniques that integrate data from building instrumentation, personal device sensors, and self-report interfaces and then deploy this platform in-the-wild to capture rich, longitudinal, ecologically-valid data about the status of office workers and the spaces they occupy. Insights will advance scientific knowledge of how buildings impact wellbeing as well as produce practical implications for building designers and operators. A timely component will explore how covid-19 has temporally or fundamentally changed occupant behaviors and operational decisions (e.g., physical distancing desks and ventilation settings that reduce pathogen spread). Overall, our proposed research has the potential to transform the industryâs thinking on how built environments can be designed, operated, and experienced. Hybrid Physical-Digital Spaces: Transforming the Design, Operation, and Experience of Built Environments to Promote Health and Wellbeing Problem and Significance Considering that people in the U.S. spend 87% of their time in indoor spaces , we assert that 1 buildings are powerful yet underleveraged loci for promoting human wellbeing. Imagine an intelligent office that could adapt soundscape systems to manage noise in open floor plans, optimize space reservation or utilization to foster collaborations and save energy, or provide digital information displays that promote employee connectedness and physical activity. Towards actualizing our vision of such hybrid physical-digital spaces, our proposal strives to develop, apply, and evaluate novel scientific and engineering approaches that will transform the industryâs thinking around how built environments can be designed, operated, and experienced. Increasingly, hypotheses suggest that built features of indoor environments (e.g., lighting, materials, and ventilation) have substantial impacts on occupants (e.g., employee recruitment and retention, absenteeism, cognition, creativity, productivity, social interactions, physical activity and health, and psychological wellbeing). In turn, these individual outcomes also drive pivotal organizational outcomes such as product innovation, workforce diversity, employee turnover, market share, and profitability. Examples illustrate how building interventions can have huge impacts : enhancing employee exposure to daylight can save businesses ~$2,000/yr per capita 2 , better air quality can raise cognitive scores of workers by 101% 3 , and increasing indoor access to biophilic elements could recoup $23 billion considering 10% of workplace absenteeism (a $226 billion dollar problem) is attributable to architecture that inadequately connects to nature 4 . However, few of these hypotheses have been tested at scale, over time, and in real world conditions . Instead, most prior efforts are small sample, short-term correlational studies based on potentially biased and sparse self-reported data. A more rigorous, scientific, and human-centered approach to study and engineer buildings that promote wellbeing can have major implications at individual, organizational, and societal levels (see Figure 1), offering both foundational theoretical knowledge as well as practical strategies for building designers and operators. Figure 1. Relations among building features and human outcomes at various levels. Further, âsmart buildingsâ today typically focus on basic sensing and control for energy savings, thermal comfort, and security. Connecting to CIFEâs Vision for the Future of Building Users, we argue buildings of the future can go beyond such bottom line outcomes to be more interactive and human-centered: aware of and responsive to occupantsâ cognitive, mental, and physical feelings and needs, while respecting privacy and promoting positive indoor experiences . 1 Klepeis, et al., 2001; 2 Heschong & Mahone, 2003; 3 Allen et al., 2016; 4 Elzeyadi, 2011. <Landay-Billington> < Hybrid Physical-Digital Spaces> 1 Theoretical and Practical Points of Departure It is imperative to increase understanding of exactly what built attributes have what impacts and on whom, in a scalable, longitudinal, and inclusive manner. Thus through technology-driven assessment and hybrid physical-digital interventions, we aim to (a) fundamentally advance the science on how built environments impact human wellbeing and, in turn, (b) generate guidelines that can revolutionize the way spaces are designed, operated, and experienced . Our current scope focuses on office spaces and workers; though an overarching goal is for our developed approaches and insights to establish a foundation that enables future research with additional populations and environments (e.g., physicians and patients in clinical settings, students and teachers in classrooms, and traditionally marginalized shift and temporary workers). In particular, our reusable platform will help others study this wider range of buildings and occupants; and combining these approaches with emerging endeavors such as biophilic design and precision interventions provides a novel opportunity to not only more deeply investigate but also address long-running public health challenges and systemic inequities facing society. In these ways, we hope to positively impact a broad cross-section of stakeholders at individual, organizational, and institutional levels. Moreover, this project will support interdisciplinary fertilization across engineering, computing, psychology, law, and medicine . Research Methods and Work Plan Our research agenda is to support the design and operation of built facilities that augment human capabilities and wellbeing â and have a fundamental positive change on the way indoor spaces are experienced by the people that occupy them. By introducing intelligent systems capable of gathering and interpreting building and occupant data as well as delivering adaptive interventions in response, novel roles will also emerge for managing buildings and the activities that take place inside them. To achieve these goals, our research will comprise three main activities: 1. Developing an extensible and secure data collection and machine learning platform . A key aim of this research is scientifically examining how built spaces impact human wellbeing. To pursue this investigation and develop methods that enable buildings to be more aware of occupantsâ states and needs, we have been developing pattern detection software that integrates data from (a) personal devices (smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers), (b) building instrumentation or portable environmental sensors (light levels, air quality), and (c) experience sampling interfaces that prompt occupants for subjective information through quick, validated self-report techniques. Figure 2 illustrates examples of these assessment components. This work involves addressing a number of technical challenges, such as selecting sampling rates and window sizes to maximize efficiency, developing methods for analyzing asynchronous and sparse sensor data, and developing privacy-sensitive feature engineering strategies for detecting and predicting wellbeing outcomes of interest. We also plan to package our platform as a reusable toolkit that can be applied by other researchers and building operators. This work is ongoing and a basic version will be ready by summer. Once development is complete, CIFE support would allow us to move onto the next critical phase: moving out of the lab and into the field. <Landay-Billington> < Hybrid Physical-Digital Spaces> 2 Figure 2. Platform to integrate data from personal devices, building sensors, and subjective self-report. 2. Deploying the platform through a mixed-method study with industry partners . The next step in our research is to deploy this platform at field sites in partnership with View, Inc. (specifically, at TIAA offices in Manhattan, this summer/fall) to capture rich, longitudinal, ecologically-valid data about behavioral, psychological, and physiological states of occupants and their everyday work environments. Our plan is to recruit a sample of approximately 150 employees for a period of 18 weeks, which will involve a baseline phase followed by systematic variation of built features (Views/No Views, Plants/No Plants, and Diversity/No Diversity in artwork) and measurement of indicators hypothesized to promote both personal wellbeing and organizational performance, based on the literature and our formative online and lab studies, described below. In combination with the engineering-focused activities to implement and install the platform, deployment will occur in tandem with ethnographic work (e.g., observations, interviews, and surveys) to manually validate reliability of the systemâs automated inferences as well as gain a more qualitative portrait of occupant experiences in various spaces. Privacy-centric engagements will additionally investigate stakeholdersâ attitudes regarding the capture of various types of information to derive implications about informed consent and personal data management. Along similar lines, it will be critical to responsibly manage captured data, especially potentially sensitive and exploitable data about wellness or performance. Therefore all studies will be conducted with oversight and approval from the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB). In addition to obtaining participantsâ informed consent, we will also design sensor and data collection mechanisms to use an opt-in model, including partial participation. Our data management systems can also allow individuals to view and delete their personal data, including if purging is desired in the event of study withdrawal.

One of the typical problems is to achieve a seemingly conflicting goal, which is to support timely delivery of real-time flows while improving resource efficiency. Recently, the concept of mixed-criticality (MC) has been widely accepted as useful in addressing the goal for real-time resource management. However, it has not been yet studied well for real-time communication. In this paper, we present the first approach to support MC flow scheduling on switched Ethernet networks leveraging an emerging network architecture, software-defined networking (SDN). Though SDN provides flexible and programmatic ways to control packet forwarding and scheduling, it yet raises several challenges to enable real-time MC flow scheduling on SDN, including: 1) how to handle (i.e., drop or re-prioritize) out-of-mode packets in the middle of the network when the criticality mode changes and 2) how the mode change affects end-to-end transmission delays. Addressing such challenges, we develop MC-SDN that supports real-time MC flow scheduling by extending SDN-enabled switches and OpenFlow protocols. It manages and schedules MC packets in different ways depending on the system criticality mode. To this end, we carefully design the mode change protocol that provides analytic mode change delay bound, and then resolve implementation issues for system architecture. For evaluation, we implement a prototype of MC-SDN on top of Open vSwitch, and integrate it into a real world network testbed as well as a 1/10 autonomous vehicle. Our extensive evaluations with the network testbed and vehicle deployment show that MC-SDN supports MC flow scheduling with minimal delays on forwarding rule updates and it brings a significant improvement in safety in a real-world application scenario.",autonomous vehicle,178,not included

Traffic needs to go through a set of ordered VNFs, which is called a Service Function Chain (SFC). Rational deployment of VNFs can reduce costs and increase profits for network operators. However, during the deployment of the VNFs, how to guarantee the reliability of SFC requirements while optimizing network resource cost is still an open problem. To this end, we study the problem of reliability-aware VNF placement in carrier networks. In this paper, we firstly redefine the reliability of SFC, which is the product of the reliability of all nodes and physical links in SFC. On this basis, we propose two reliability protection mechanisms: the All-Nodes Protection Mechanism (ANPM) and the Single-Node Protection Mechanism (SNPM). Following this, for each protection mechanism, we formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model. Due to the problem complexity, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on Dynamic Programming and Lagrangian Relaxation for each protection mechanism.

A computing concept where physical objects used in daily life, will identify themselves by getting connected to the internet is called IoT. Physical objects embedded with electronic, radio-frequency identification, software, sensors, actuators and smart objects converge with the internet to accumulate and share data in IoT. IoT is expected to bring in extreme changes and solutions to most of the daily problems in the real world. Thus, IoT provides connectivity for everyone and everything at any time. The IoT embeds some intelligence in Internet connected objects to communicate, exchange information, take decisions, invoke actions and provide amazing services. It has an imperative economic and societal impact for the future construction of information, network, and communication technology. In the upcoming years, the IoT is expected to bridge various technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together to support the intelligent decision making. As the most cost-effective and performant source of positioning and timing information in outdoor environments, the global navigation satellite systems(GNSS) has become an essential element of major contemporary technology developments notably including the IoT, Big Data, Smart Cities and Multimodal Logistics. By 2020, there will be more than 20 billion interconnected IoT devices, and its market size may reach $1.5 trillion. Projections for the impact of IoT on the Internet and economy are impressive, with some anticipating as many as 100 billion connected IoT devices and a global economic impact of more than $11 trillion by 2025. Regulators can play a role in encouraging the development and adoption of the IoT, by preventing abuse of market dominance, protecting users and protecting Internet networks while promoting efficient markets and the public interest. Regulators can consider and identify some measures to foster development of the IoT. Encourage development of LTEâA and 5G wireless networks, and keep need for IoTâspecific spectrum under review. Universal IPv6 adoption by governments in their own services and procurements, and other incentives for private sector adoption. Increasing interoperability through competition law and give users a right to easy access to personal data. Support global standardization and deployment of remotely provisioned SIMs for greater machine to machine competition. Particular attention will be needed from regulators to IoT privacy and security issues, which are key to encouraging public trust in and adoption of the technology.

Traditional software diversity or code randomization techniques diversify the code memory layout and make it difficult for potential attackers to pinpoint the precise location of the target vulnerability. However, those approaches may not be sufficient enough for the new micro architecture attacks (e.g., Spectre). While some architecture researchers have proposed using diverse ISA configurations to defeat code injection or code reuse attacks, most of these works remain in the simulation stage due to legal, licensing, and verification costs involved in bringing a heterogeneous chip design into physical hardware [39]. In this paper, we report our on-going work of HeterSec, a framework to secure applications utilizing real world heterogeneous ISA machines. HeterSec runs on top of the commodity x86_64 and ARM64 machines. It gives the process the ability to dynamically select its underlying ISA environment. Therefore, the protected process would hide the vulnerable targets with the diversified instruction set, or would detect the abnormal behavior by comparing the execution results step-by-step from multiple ISA-diversified instances. To demonstrate the effectiveness of such software framework, we implemented HeterSec on Linux and showed its deployability by running it on a x86_64 and ARM64machine pair, connected using InfiniBand. We then conduct two case studies with HeterSec. In the first case, we timely randomize the process execution path across the ISA, which achieves similar security guarantees as the existing architecture based solutions. In the second case, we implement a multi-ISA based multi-version execution (MVX) system, providing a stronger security guarantee than current homogeneousISA MVX designs.",autonomous vehicle,181,not included

The goal of this approach is to improve computational capabilities in Mechanical Engineering and long-term retention rates with a single broad emphasis. Major and minor changes were implemented in the course, from specific day to day in-class activities to the addition of laboratory sessions to replace traditional classroom lecture. These laboratories of no more than fifteen students were delivered by Learning Assistants, which were upper-level undergraduate peer educators. To evaluate proficiency, a MATLAB post-test was delivered to students who were instructed through lecture only (âLectureâ) and those who were instructed with the above changes (âActiveâ). A survey was also provided upon completion of the course to the Active group for student reflection on their perceived software capability and the usefulness of approaches. Post-test results suggest that the Active group was more proficient in MATLAB than the Lecture group. Survey results suggest that the Active group recognize they had not achieved expert use of the software but that they were likely to use it throughout their careers and that all approaches were useful, in particular the use of Learning Assistants. Future longterm retention statistics will shed light on the possible effectiveness of this approach, which are currently unavailable. Introduction Colorado State University has a total student enrollment in excess of 33,000. As a land grant university, the historic mission of the institution is to provide students with an education in practical fields such as agriculture and engineering. The College of Engineering has a growing student cohort, with an increase from ~450 first-year students Fall 2010 to ~600 students Fall 2015 [1]. However, persistence and graduation rates have remained fairly steady over the last fifteen years. The current six year persistence rate within the college is only ~45% and the six year graduation rate within the college is similar at ~43%. Many students do not remain within the college for even a full year, as the second fall persistence rate is only 70-75% [1]. These data show a significant portion of enrolled first-year engineering students do not remain within the program long enough to be exposed to foundational engineering content, which starts in the sophomore year with engineering specific courses. A current goal of the college is to improve these retention statistics. Additionally, many students do not develop the necessary software skills required to use computational tools such as MATLAB, which are integral to success in the curriculum. Students who do not develop these skills during introductory coursework must âcatch upâ in later courses, where the technical content is more challenging. We hypothesize this can lead to unpreparedness for challenging content or careers as an engineer and can negatively impact academic standing, leading to decreased retention. Thus, the goals of this work were to 1) improve retention rates for first-year engineering students, specifically mechanical engineering, and 2) improve computational and software skills of first-year students, specifically MATLAB and Microsoft Excel. MATLAB is a common computational package which can be used for a broad range of engineering problems throughout a curriculum [2]. However, learning Excel and MATLAB through lecture is challenging, as these tools are best understood through utilization, not observation [3]. MATLAB and other computational tools are often taught in classrooms with computational equipment, however this is can be a challenge with a large classroom [4]. Some have utilized computer based tutorials which students can complete on their own time [5], while others implemented a large scale deployment of personal computers equipped with MATLAB and other software [6]. Additionally, the use of peer-educators can be an effective approach to facilitating MATLAB development [7]. Thus, we have chosen to employ an approach which utilizes an active environment to learn MATLAB and other introductory content through the use of laboratory sessions and peer-educators, in this case the Learning Assistant model [8]. Similar to previous approaches, we have utilized classroom lectures, hands on in-class activities, and laboratory sessions [9]. The Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Course (MECH 103) was developed to provide students with an overview of the mechanical engineering discipline and as an introduction to the computational packages MATALB [10] and Microsoft Excel. The course consists of between 140 and 250 first-year students and was previously delivered using traditional lecture. While this approach was most efficient for a single instructor due to the enrollment size, this resulted in a static learning environment for a course which should excite students about mechanical engineering and provide foundational technical skills. The overall approach to this work was to thus create an active environment for students within the course, which had an enrollment of 145 students for the Fall 2016 semester. The rationale to this approach was that by providing students with hands-on experiences working with mechanical engineering problems and computational software, the understanding of course content will improve [11,12] whereby improving retention [13]. While some immediate test and survey data were acquired and are shown in this work, it is important to note that the true impact on retention is not currently recognizable and will require future analysis. In-Class Sessions Class sessions were varied throughout the semester and the week, as they typically included lectured course material, guest lectures or panels, and activities. The course met Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9-9:50 AM in a large lecture hall with individual stadium seating. Friday lecture was often cancelled and this time was spent in weekly laboratory sessions instead, which are outlined in the next section. Monday class time was assigned to covering course content through lecture, teamwork activities, and in class problems. The content of the course included general introductory material such as teamwork, communication, and design, commonly used units and unit conversions, mathematical models and systems, and an introduction to Microsoft Excel and MATLAB. Active engagement in the class included a teamwork design problem, requiring students to break into groups of three. Due to the theater seating layout of the classroom, groups of four or more made successful teamwork and communication difficult. Each group of students were provided one piece of 8.5â x 11â blank printer paper, one paperclip, and two pieces of scotch tape. The design problem was simple: build the tallest free standing structure possible using only the given materials. This was an inexpensive and simple approach to teamwork design activity. In place of a lecture or even a discussion on how to use design techniques for a simple problem such as this, students were able to actively engage in this process despite the difficulties of class size and layout. While students typically have an excellent understanding of units such as a pound (lb), their physical understanding of units such as a Joule or Watt are less developed within the context of everyday life. To provide students with a meaningful representation of energy (Joule) and power (Watt), they were provided a common object â in this case a softball â and asked to calculate how high they would have to raise the object to exert one Joule of energy â in this case roughly a foot and a half. While simple and inexpensive, this activity provided students with useful knowledge they can apply without a calculator and helps them relate coursework to the real world. For example, if they can place a Joule into real-world context, they could then answer the question âCan I launch a rocket into space using a thousand Joules?â. Wednesday lecture sessions were commonly used for guest lecturers and panels. These class sessions included the College of Engineering Dean, faculty members and graduate students in mechanical engineering, industry panelists, entrepreneurs and small business owners, and an interactive teamwork theatre troupe. The goal of these sessions was to provide students with a broad overview of different disciplines within mechanical engineering and what skills are necessary to succeed in various professional roles. While emphasizing an active learning environment is inherently difficult with each and every guest, student engagement was addressed by delivering variability in all of the presentations and strongly encouraging students to ask questions. For example, the theater troupe was an interactive experience where students were able to act as a team member within a group that mocked to show a diverse team struggling with communication. This session involved humor, discussion, and lively responses from students in place of a traditional static lecture. Laboratory Sessions In place of Friday lecture, students were asked to attend laboratory sessions for one hour [14,3]. A total of eleven sessions were provided throughout the week to accommodate all schedules. Sessions included one instructor, 13-16 students, and were held in laboratories with individual workstations with Microsoft Excel and MATLAB software. Laboratory instructors included a Graduate Teaching Fellow and Undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs). Laboratory sessions involved a short (<5 minutes) lecture briefly reviewing content from class before students began working on assigned problems. These problems implemented course content such as the use of Excel or MATLAB to analyze and display data through real-world applications.

However, locomotion on legged robots is a challenging multidimensional control problem. This paper presents a machine learning approach to legged locomotion, with all training done on the physical robots. The main contributions are a specification of our fully automated learning environment and a detailed empirical comparison of four different machine learning algorithms for learning quadrupedal locomotion. The resulting learned walk is considerably faster than all previously reported hand-coded walks for the same robot platform. Introduction The ability to deploy a fully autonomous robot in an unstructured, dynamic environment (the proverbial real world) over an extended period of time remains an open challenge in the field of robotics. Considerable progress is being made towards many components of this task including physical agility, power management, and on-board sensor technology. One such component that has drawn considerable interest recently is the ability for a robot to autonomously learn to improve its own performance (Ng et al. 2004; Bagnell & Schneider 2001; Zhang & Vadakkepat 2003). Despite this interest, considerable work remains due to the di fficulties associated with machine learning in the real world . Compared to other machine learning scenarios such as classification or action learning in simulation, learning o n physical robots presents several formidable challenges, i ncluding the following. Sparse Training Data: It is often prohibitively difficult to generate large amounts of data due to the maintenance required on robots, such as battery changes, hardware repairs, and, usually, constant human supervision. Thus, learning methods designed for physical robots must be effective with small amounts of data. Dynamical Complexity: The dynamics of many robotic control tasks are too complex for faithful simulation to be possible. Furthermore, robots are inherently situated in an unstructured environment with unpredictable sensor and actuator noise, namely the real world. Thus, even when off-line simulation is possible, it can never be fully reflective of the target environment. In this paper, we overcome these challenges for one concrete complex robot task, namely legged locomotion. Using a commercially available quadruped robot, we fully automate the training process (other than battery changes) and Copyright c Â© 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. employ machine learning algorithms that are sufficiently data efficient to enable productive learning on physical robots in a matter of hours. The resulting learned walk is considerably faster than all previously reported hand-cod ed walks for the same robot platform. This paper contributes both a specification of our fully automated learning environment and a detailed empirical comparison of four different machine learning algorithms for learning quadrupedal locomotion. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the parameterized walk which our learning process seeks to optimize. We then specify our four learning approaches, and follow with detailed empirical results. We close with a discussion of their implications and possible avenues for future work. A Parameterized Walk The Sony Aibo ERS-210A is a commercially available robot that is equipped with a color CMOS camera and an optional ethernet card that can be used for wireless communication. The Aibo is a quadruped robot, and has three degrees of freedom in each of its four legs (Sony 2004). At the lowest level, the Aiboâs gait is determined by a series of joint positions for the three joints in each of its leg s. An early attempt to develop a gait by Hornby et al. (1999) involved using a genetic algorithm to learn a set of lowlevel parameters that described joint velocities and body p osition.1 More recent attempts to develop gaits for the Aibo have involved adopting a higher-level representation that deals with the trajectories of the Aiboâs four feet through three-dimensional space. An inverse kinematics calculati on is then used to convert these trajectories into joint angles . Among higher-level approaches, most of the differences between gaits that have been developed for the Aibo stem from the shape of the loci through which the feet pass and the exact parameterizations of those loci. For example, a team from the University of New South Wales achieved the fastest known hand-tuned gait using the high-level approach described above with trapezoidal loci. They subsequently generated an even faster walk via learning (Kim & Uther 2003). A team from Germany created a flexible gait implementation that allows them to use a variety of different shapes of loci (Rofer et al. 2003), and the team from the University of Newcastle was able to generate highvelocity gaits using a genetic algorithm and loci of arbitra ry shape (Quinlan, Chalup, & Middleton 2003). Our team (UT Austin Villa, Stone t al. 2004) first approached the gait optimization problem by hand-tuning Developed on an earlier version of the Aibo. a gait described by half-elliptical loci. This gait performed comparably to those of other teams participating in RoboCup 2003. The work reported in this paper uses the hand-tuned UT Austin Villa walk as a starting point for learning. Figure 1 compares the reported speeds of the gaits mentioned above, both hand-tuned and learned, including that of our starting point, the UT Austin Villa walk. The latter walk is described fully in a team technical report (Stone et al. 2004). The remainder of this section describes those details of the UT Austin Villa walk that are important to understand for the purposes of this paper.

The half-elliptical locus used by our team is shown in Figure 2. By instructing each foot to move through a locus of this shape, with each pair of diagonally opposite legs in phase with each other and perfectly out of phase with the other two (a gait known as a trot), we enable the Aibo to walk. Four parameters define this elliptical locus: 1. The length of the ellipse; 2. The height of the ellipse; 3. The position of the ellipse on the x axis; and 4. The position of the ellipse on the y axis. Since the Aibo is roughly symz",autonomous vehicle,185,not included

To reduce the possibility of such unanticipated failures, the system must be monitored for tell-tale symptoms of degradation that are suggestive of imminent failure. In this work, we introduce a novel time series analysis technique that allows the decomposition of the time series into trend and fluctuation components, providing the monitoring software with actionable information about the changes of the system's behavior over time. We analyze the underlying problem and formulate it to a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem that can be solved with existing QP-solvers. However, when the profiling resolution is high, as generally required by real-world applications, such a decomposition becomes intractable to general QP-solvers. To speed up the problem solving, we further transform the problem and present a novel QP formulation, Non-negative QP, for the problem and demonstrate a tractable solution that bypasses the use of slow general QP-solvers. We demonstrate our ideas on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that our method allows us to accurately extract the degradation phenomenon of time series. We further demonstrate the generality of our ideas by applying them beyond classic machine prognostics to problems in identifying the influence of news events on currency exchange rates and stock prices. We fully implement our profiling system and deploy it into several physical systems, such as chemical plants and nuclear power plants, and it greatly helps detect the degradation phenomenon, and diagnose the corresponding components.",autonomous vehicle,186,not included

To help to de-risk the system integration, and to assist in the design process, computer simulation is an accepted and widely-adopted tool. However, in a simulation-only environment, many real-world issues such as noise, randomness of event timings, and hardware design issues are not well explored. In addition, there are limits on the size and fidelity of system which can be simulated, due to the required computational intensity, and because control systems for devices often contain software which is proprietary and cannot be modelled accurately. Physical Hardware in the Loop Simulation provides an interim stage between purely computer-based simulation, and real device deployment. Part of the power system (or âSmart Gridâ) is simulated, but specific components are implemented in actual hardware. The hardware may consist of instrumentation, relays or controllers, carrying no primary current. Such testing is termed âSecondary Hardware-in-the-Loopâ, as the signals exchanged between the simulation and hardware consist only of measurements and control values. A more advanced environment is created where primary power flow is exchanged with the hardware. This is termed âPrimary Hardware-in-the-Loopâ or âPower Hardware-in-the-Loopâ testing. In addition to measurement and control signals being exchanged with the simulation, an interface is required at which primary power is exchanged between the simulation and the hardware, at the voltage and current levels suitable for the hardware under test. Creation of such environments is complex, but allows steady-state, dynamic, and worst-case scenarios to be re-created in a controlled environment. Therefore hardware-in-the-loop testing offers a cheaper, safer, faster and more comprehensive de-risking process than trying the hardware for the first time on a real network. The complexity and interconnected nature of the Smart Grid means that such Hardware in the Loop based testing is becoming even more critical to understanding the behaviour of systems and schemes, and consequently the safe and secure introduction of new technologies.",autonomous vehicle,187,not included

A joint effort from the automobile industry, transportation industry, and government offices is driving the adoption of this technology to build intelligent transportation systems that consist of smart vehicles. This study attempts to improve the reliability and efficiency of vehicular networking. The study assumes the context of platooning applications, but the contributions of this study can be applied to other vehicular applications as well. There are two contributions in this study. First, a wireless emulator is designed and implemented to emulate IEEE 802.11 networks in real-time using the Ethernet infrastructure. The emulator replaces the MAC layer and physical layer of IEEE 802.11 networking stack with a real-time CSMA/CA model, thus reduces the cost of experiments. It provides upper layers the same interfaces as on a real device. As a result, the testing targets in the emulation are real-world software components as opposed to simulation scripts in a discrete event simulator. These software components can be routing protocols, transport protocols, or applications, and are the same code that can be deployed in the real world. Second, an Interframe Compression Transmission Layer is designed and implemented, to provide efficient transmission of periodical messages in vehicular environments. The transmission layer compresses the difference between frames instead of frames themselves, and reduces bandwidth consumption significantly. To improve the behaviors of the transmission layer under different scenarios and configurations studied, an adaptive version of the algorithm is designed, which achieves more than 50% in reduction of bandwidth consumption using real-world platooning data trace. With lower bandwidth consumption, delivery ratio is vastly improved in congested networking environments.",autonomous vehicle,188,not included

We deployed this MOOC three times with a total enrollment of over 100,000 students. If MOOCs are truly going to transform engineering education, then they must be able to deliver classes with laboratory components. Our offering goes a long way in unraveling the perceived complexities in delivering a laboratory experience to thousands of students from around the globe. We believe the techniques developed in this class will significantly transform the MOOC environment. Effective education requires students to learn by doing. In the traditional academic setting this active learning is achieved through a lab component. Translating this to the online environment is a non-trivial task that required several important factors to come together. First, we have significant support from industrial partners ARM Inc. [1] and Texas Instruments [2]. Second, the massive growth of embedded microcontrollers has made the availability of lost-cost development platforms feasible. Third, we have assembled a team with the passion, patience, and experience of delivering quality lab experiences to large classes. Fourth, online tools now exist that allow students to interact and support each other. We used edX for the delivery of videos, interactive animations, text, and quizzes [3]. We used Piazza [4] for discussion boards and Zyante [5] for a programming reference. We partnered with element-14 [6], Digi-Key [7], and Mouser [8] to make the lab kit available and low-cost. Even though there was a $40-$70 cost to purchase the lab kit, the course completion numbers were slightly better than a typical MOOC. 7.3% of the students completed enough of the class to receive a certificate. Students completing end of the course surveys report a 95% overall satisfaction. Demographics show a world-wide reach with India, US, and Egypt being the countries with the most students. In this paper we will present best practices, successes and limitations of teaching a substantial lab across the globe. Background An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with a computer, hidden inside, to serve a single dedicated purpose [9-11]. There are over 50 billion processors based on the ARM architecture delivered into products, and most of these computers are single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system. Embedded systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges, our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers. Review Other online classes have delivered laboratory experiences. Hesselink at Stanford University developed iLabs as a means to deliver science experiments to online learning. Their lab-in-a-box involves simulations and animations [12]. OâMalley et al. from the University of Manchester developed a Chemistry MOOC with a lab component using virtual labs and simulations [13-14]. University of Washington presented a hardware/software MOOC on Coursera [15]. This course is primarily a programming class without graded physical labs. Ferri et al. from Georgia Institute of Technology created a MOOC for linear circuits [16]. This class had activities to perform with NIâs myDAC, but graded lab circuits were not part of the online experience. Connor, and Huettel at Duke created a Virtual Community of Practice for electric circuits [17]. Cherner et al. created a virtual multifunctional X-Ray diffractometer for teaching science and engineering [18]. Saterbak et al. at Rice University developed online materials to teach freshman design, with the goal to free-up class time for more interactive learning experiences [19]. Harris from University of California at Irvine has a six-course sequence on Introduction to the Internet of Things and Embedded Systems where students build actual embedded devices [20]. Grading for this course uses peer assessment. Lee et al. at Berkeley developed an introduction to embedded systems MOOC with laboratory exercises. The lab itself was a robotic controller in a virtual laboratory environment. Completion of the labs themselves does have an automatic grading component based on the studentâs written software [21-22]. All this work emphasizes the need for hands on learning. Pedagogy The overall educational objective of this class is to allow students to discover how computers interact with the environment. The class provides hands-on experiences of how an embedded system could be used to solve problems. The focus of this introductory course is understanding and analysis rather than design, where students learn new techniques by doing them. We feel we have solved the dilemma in learning a laboratory-based topic like embedded systems, where there is a tremendous volume of details that first must be learned before hardware and software systems can be designed. The approach taken in this course is to learn by doing in a bottom-up fashion. One of the advantages of a bottom-up approach to learning is that the student begins by mastering simple concepts. Once the student truly understands simple concepts, he or she can embark on the creative process of design, which involves putting the pieces together to create a more complex system. True creativity involves solving complex problems using effective combinations of simple components. Embedded systems afford an effective platform to teach new engineers how to program for three reasons. First, there is no operating system. Thus, in a bottom-up fashion the student can see, write, and understand all software running on a system that actually does something. Second, embedded systems involve real input/output that is easy for the student to touch, hear, and see. Many engineering students struggle with abstraction. We believe many students learn effectively by using their sense of touch, hearing and sight to first understand and internalize difficult concepts, and then they will be able to develop and appreciate abstractions. Third, embedded systems are employed in many everyday products, motivating students to see firsthand, how engineering processes can be applied in the real world. This course is intended for beginning college students with some knowledge of electricity as would have been taught in an introductory college physics class. Secondly, it is expected students will have some basic knowledge of programming and logic design. No specific language will be assumed as prior knowledge but this class could be taken as their second programming class. We hoped experienced engineers could also use this course to train or retrain in the field of embedded systems. Learning objectives of the course Although the students are engaged with a fun and rewarding lab experience, our educational pedagogy is centered on fundamental learning objectives. After the successful conclusion of this class, students should be able to understand the basic components of a computer, write C language programs that perform input/output interfacing, implement simple data structures, manipulate numbers in multiple formats, and understand how software uses global memory to store permanent information and the stack to store temporary information. Our goal is for students to learn these concepts: 0) How the computer stores and manipulates data; 1) Embedded systems using modular design and abstraction; 2) Design tools like requirements documents, data flow graphs, and call graphs; 3) C programming: considering both function and style; 4) Debugging and verification using a simulator and the real microcontroller; 5) Debugging tools like voltmeters, oscilloscopes, and logic analyzers; 6) How to input/output using switches, LEDs, DACs, ADCs, and serial ports; 7) Implementation of an I/O driver, multithreaded programming, and interrupts; 8) Analog to digital conversion (ADC), periodic sampling, and the Nyquist Theorem; 9) Stepper motors, brushed DC motors, and simple digital controllers; 10) Digital to analog conversion (DAC), used to make simple sounds; 11) Simple distributed systems that connect two microcontrollers; 12) Internet of things, connecting the embedded system to the internet; 13) System-level design that combine multiple components together. Laboratory Kit Active learning requires a platform for the student to learn by doing. Figure 1 shows the components of the basic lab kit. There are two difficulties with a physical lab kit deployed in a world-wide open classroom environment. The first problem is availability of components. We partnered with companies and distributors six months in advance of the course launch to guarantee availability. The companies wanted us to specify the number of students who would buy the kit. In this regard, we were very lucky. Six months prior to our first launch, we estimated 2000 people would register for the class and 1000 would buy the kit. In turns out Texas Instruments produced 10,000 microcontroller boards just in case. Much to our surprise 40,000 people registered and we estimate 11,000 purchased the kit during this first delivery of the course. The second solution to the problem of availability was to have three world-wide distributors (element-14, Mouser, and Digi-Key). Working with these distributors, we created one-click landing pages for students to buy the kit. Furthermore, for each component in the kit (other than the microcontroller board), we had three or more possible parts. The third solution was to design the course with flexible deadlines and pathways. Each lab had a simulation and a real-board requirement. Students who were waiting for the parts to be shipped could proceed with ",autonomous vehicle,192,not included

Numerous experiments have recently demonstrated that channel-based key establishment (CBKE) is a promising alternative to well-known symmetric/asymmetric approaches. Their run-times for establishing a symmetric key suggest that such methods are highly suitable for real-world applications that operate in a dynamic mobile environment with peer-to-peer association. CBKE is a new paradigm for generating shared secret keys. The approach is based on the estimation of the wireless transmission channel by both the sender and receiver, where the shared secret key is derived from channel parameters. The commonness of the randomness of the secret key relies on the principle of channel reciprocity. Specifically, this means that the channel from Alice to Bob is the same than the channel from Bob to Alice. This symmetry of practical channels is usually sufficiently high, as well as its entropy of spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics. Security is given if an attackerâs distance to the two communicating nodes is high enough, so that the observed channel parameters to each node are uncorrelated and independent from each other. Typically, in real environments this is given if the distance is greater than about half of the carrier wavelength. For instance, for the frequency used in 2.4 GHz WiFi, this translates to a distance of 6.25 cm. So far, high usability and dynamic key management are very difficult to achieve for wireless devices, which operate under strict resource constraints. CBKE has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of securing small embedded devices, and hence make mass production and deployment more viable. Until now, no research has addressed the requirements for performance evaluation of real-world implementations of CBKE systems. We present a wireless CBKE security system built with standard components, e.g., quantization scheme and error correction codes, presented in recent publications. We introduce necessary implementation properties and requirements of CBKE systems. In order to validate the performance of the key generation algorithms, we define a set of metrics. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation on an ARM-Cortex M3 microcontroller to demonstrate the practical feasibility of channel-based key estimation using current embedded hardware.

For this purpose, we distinguish between physical RGs and software RGs, which can be further subdivided into cryptographically secure and insecure RGs. Physical RGs covered by our study are the hardware generator PRG310-4 and /dev/random as implemented in the Linux kernel. Since /dev/random is fed by system events, we analyze both an idle lab environment and a server hosting several virtual machines. As examples for cryptographically secure RGs our analysis compares the RSA generator and the Blum-Blum-Shub generator, both for 3000-bit moduli. Additionally, we compare them to the Nisan-Wigderson construction with suitably selected parameters. We include two cryptographically insecure RGs, namely a linear congruential generator (LCG) and the Littlewood generator. In order to obtain repeatable and comparable results, our implementations of the software RGs were all run on the same machine and produced 512 kB of output each, using AES post-processed output of the generator PRG310-4 as source for random seed bits. We compare the results in terms of byte entropy and throughput excluding initialization. For further statistical analysis â not shown in the table â we apply the NIST test suite on the outputs. The most important finding is that in our scenarios, number-theoretic generators compete very well against hardware-based ones. byte entropy runtime throughput throughput [bit] [Î¼s] [kB/s] normalized PRG310-4, no post-processing 7.99963 16308400 31.39486 4.34492 AES post-processing 7.99963 36524300 14.01806 1.94004 /dev/random, in the field 7.99979 9.169Ã 10 5.584Ã 10â3 7.728Ã 10â4 in the lab 7.99948 2.671Ã 10 1.917Ã 10â4 2.653Ã 10â5 Littlewood 6.47244 15206550 33.66970 4.61011 Linear congruential generator 7.99969 2644039 193.64313 26.51392 Blum-Blum-Shub 7.99962 17708350 28.91291 3.95880 RSA, e = 2 + 1, 1400 bit/round 7.99966 267604 1913.27484 261.96857 e = 3, 1 bit/round 7.99963 70103838 7.30345 1 Nisan-Wigderson 7.99961 2731227 187.46153 25.66753 Table 1: Overview of the results for generating 512 kB of output.",autonomous vehicle,193,not included

They tend to gift a unique multilayered conveyance knowledge cloud platform by exploitation cloud computing and IoT technologies to resolve the challenges caused by the increasing transportation issues. They present a novel multilayered vehicular data cloud platform by using cloud computing and IoT technologies.

By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. Michele Nitti, Luigi Atzori, and Irena Pletikosa Cvijikj [3] addressed the issue by analyzing possible strategies for the benefit of overall network navigability.They first propose five heuristics, which are based on local network properties and that are expected to have an impact on the overall network structure. Thet then perform extensive experiments, which are intended to analyze the performance in terms of giant components, average degree of connections, local clustering, and average path length.

Staying true to the IoT vision, they propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over lowpower wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network International Conference on Science and Engineering for Sustainable Development (ICSESD-2017) (www.jit.org.in) International Journal of Advanced Engineering, Management and Science (IJAEMS) Special Issue-1 https://dx.doi.org/10.24001/icsesd2017.49 ISSN : 2454-1311 www.ijaems.com Page | 195 infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service.

They also provides an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, they explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. They also presents the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Stecca, M., Moiso, C., Fornasa, M., Baglietto, P. [7] presents app execution platform (AEP), a platform that supports the design, deployment, execution, and management of IoT applications in the domain of smart home, smart car, and smart city. AEP was designed to coherently fulfill a set of requirements covered only partially or in a fragmented way by other IoT application platforms. AEP focuses on SO virtualization and on composite application (CA) orchestration and supports dynamic object availability. Yi-Bing Lin, Yun-Wei Lin, Chang-Yen Chih, Tzu-Yi Li [8] proposes an IoT device which is characterized by its âfeaturesâ (e.g., temperature, vibration, and display) that are manipulated by the network applications. If a network application handles the individual device features independently, then we can write a software module for each device feature, and the network application can be simply constructed by including these brick-like device feature modules. Based on the concept of device feature, brick-like software modules can provide simple and efficient mechanism to develop IoT device applications and interactions.

To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, they introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.

Moreover, we utilize the provided context to assign the generated profiles to more contextually complex activities. This methodology is being evaluated into an AAL structure equipped with several sensors. More precisely, they assess the proposed method in a data set generated by accelerometers and its performance over a number of everyday activities Mainetti, L., Lecce, Mighali, V. ; Patrono, L. [12] proposes a software architecture to easily mash-up constrained application protocol (CoAP) resources. It is able to discover the available devices and to virtualize them outside the physical network. These virtualizations are then exposed to the upper layers by a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface, so that the physical devices interact only with their own virtualization. Furthermore, the system provides simplified tools allowing the development of mash-up applications to different-skilled users. Finally, the architecture allows not only to monitor but also to control the devices, thus establishing a bidirectional communication channel.

The project was developed by students and demonstrates new ideas and teamwork. This project was successfully completed and has been developed, implemented and assessed. Topics covered are: how to build a smart gird by utilizing computer application software tools, design, simulation, and diagnoses of electrical distribution systems. All the real world components in electrical distribution network such as residential, commercial and industrial building are modeled in this project. Background The purpose of this project is to design and implement a small scale electric power network by a team of seven students, supervised by a faculty member. The studentsâ background is in electrical engineering with emphasis in electric power system. The students conducted a study in the field of Smart Grid technologies for history and background information. This work led to designing and implementing a small model of a smart gird power distribution network. The power grid represents the real world aspirations of both government and private industry geared toward building a more reliable, responsive, and overall efficient network of residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Since the concept of a smart grid is very vague, students chose to implement a time tested and proven aspect of such technology known as smart meters. The smart meter is a wireless device connected to every house, industrial and commercial buildings to provide essential feedback in real time to the power companies. This feedback could be in the form of a fault occurring at that said location, or illegal energy usage. This feedback in real time is very useful to the power companies, given the fact that most rely on feedback via a phone call from the consumer before they know whether or not there is a fault in the system. Another purpose of implementing the grid was to simulate metering technology at the residential, industrial and commercial level. These meters would send data to a computer which is a simulated control room in order to read where certain faults occur in the system. In turn one could control which areas of the grid would be supplying the power. This represents a simulation of the power companyâs ability to read and send vital information throughout the grid, thus improving the responsiveness and reliability of the network. Figure 1 illustrates the completed model after it was built and during testing. The lifecycle of this project was implemented in three different phases and started in September of 2009 and it was completed in May of 2010. Planning and analysis was completed in phase I, design and implementation in phase II, and documentation and studentsâ assessment in phase III. Figure 1. A model of smart grid in electrical distribution system Phase I: Planning and Analysis Initially, each team member worked on individual research on the concepts of smart grid its purpose. Later on, a decision was made as to what the team wanted to demonstrate with the project. The decision was made to show specifically how smart meters would work and help in fault detection as well as saving money by removing the need for meter readers to read the power meters every month. A project leader was elected by the team members to coordinate the team work. Meetings were then set up by the project leader, to brainstorm on how the actual implementation was going to be planned. Microsoft Project software was very instrumental to organize the work of the team. Tasks were assigned with specific due dates to keep the project on schedule and under budget. Requirements Since this project was spread over three quarters, students had many deadlines and task that had to be met in order to have a successful project. There were three phases to this project, research, background study and planning during the 1 quarter, design and building during the 2 quarter and the final stage of testing and troubleshooting during the 3 quarter along with final oral presentation, simulation documentation and assessment of the project. The students made documents and recorded each steps of the project down to each task and timeline by using Microsoft Project software. The project advisor coordinated the project steps and students were required to present a weekly progress report. This step insured that the project was moving smooth and on the track. The group was divided into two teams, one in software teams which consisted of two members and a hardware team which consisted of other five group members. The software team was in charge of all the coding and GUI implementation so the actual grid can communicate back and forth with the computer. The hardware team was in charge of the physical grid which consisted of the circuit that was built using logic chips such as MUXs, and Flip-Flops, wiring, creating a map on the grid with houses, roads, school, power stations, sub-stations, transmission lines, and distributions lines. The commercial site consists of shopping area, factories, stadium, school and so forth. In final stages of the project, testing, debugging and troubleshooting was performed in order to assure that hardware components and related software can communicate back and forth in a proper sequence. Much of the requirements had the made along the way since this was very new to all students. Phase II: Design and Implementation The design started immediately after the clear definition of the project requirement and purpose. To lower the cost and improve the safety, the design would be a DC (Direct Current) representation of an AC (Alternate Current) system. The system was designed by drawing out the model of a city and the specific buildings to exist in that city. The design was based on what took place in the planning stage which defined how the city and buildings will receive their power and the power. Figure 2. The process of building a smart grid The next challenge in the design process was solving the problem of switches and smart meters. Figure 2 shows the design of the smart meters and placement of LEDs (Light Emitting Diode). The LEDs will represent whether a particular house, building or transformer has power on or off. If for any reason an LED was not lit, then that particular item does not have power. The faults were determined by voltages because even if the building wasnât drawing power, then there still would be a voltage on the line. This voltage was then sent to a 64 to 1 multiplexor which was then sent to the microcontroller to determine faults. To turn the power of buildings âonâ and âoffâ a common NPN transistor (2n2222) and the base current was provided by a flip flop integrated circuit. Flip flops were used due to I/Oâs limitations of the PIC. Figure 3 was duplicated for every transformer, with the only difference being the number of buildings being fed from the transformer which is the first LED after the 12V source. Figure 3. Circuit diagram for buildings Implementation A Smart Grid system includes a power meter which enables the communication systems to update the utility about its condition and the electronics to control the meter. The old electromechanical meters that were used are becoming obsolete since they cannot support the features that the utilities desire to have such as monitoring and controlling power supplied to its customers. Utilities wishes to monitor power consumption so that they can accurately predict how much power will be used during peak and down times. This information is helpful in producing sufficient energy and better efficiency in power waste. It can also help to pinpoint locations of power outages leading to a quicker recovery time. Challenges in implementation of the system are based on a couple of issues. First is the cost. It could cost upwards of $1000 for each smart meter, depending on features to be installed for each house or business. The costs can add up quickly, and the utilities don't see any immediate savings or incentive to deploy the smart grid in a very near future. The system designed in this project is using smart meters with a simulated wireless connection to the central servers at the utilities. The meters would send a signal to the central computer to update its status, power consumption, and other things. It can be designed in a way that it will have a battery backup for when the power is interrupted, or have the central computer assume it is off when it doesn't send a signal at the regular time intervals. Obviously the latter option would be the most cost effective and would use less power to run. But having power to the smart meter could also be beneficial because diagnostics could be run to determine if the power went out or if the meter is having its own internal hardware problems. A wireless signal was simulated for this project, but in real world application one can use either wireless, normal phone lines, or communications over power line. Most utilities already have communications systems set up through their power lines and using this method would be most cost effective. Having wireless, on the other hand, frees up usage of the power lines reducing their stress and prolonging the cables life. Companies are developing and testing their own systems using one of those options. In any case, it is based on hardware availability and cost effectiveness.

Communication with the smart grid Phase III: Documentation and Studentsâ Assessment In phase III of the project, the students provided a detail documentation of the project which includes cost analysis and different phases of the design. An electronic copy of this documentation and demo presentation was produced in a DVD.

It is based on a common conceptual data model of great generality that allows both humans and machines to work with interrelated, but disjoint, information as if it was a single global database. The design and implementation of a general, scalable, federated and flexible data storage and indexing model, which corresponds to the data model of the Semantic Web, is fundamental for the success and deployment of such a system. The generality of the RDF data model presents unique challenges to efficient storage, indexing and querying engines. This paper presents our experience and work related to RDFStore which implements a new flexible indexing and query model. The model is tailored to RDF data and is designed around the Semantic Web from the ground up. The paper describes the underlying indexing algorithm, together with comparisons to other existing RDF storage and query strategies. Towards a lightweight database architecture The generality of the RDF data model presents unique challenges to efficient storage, indexing and querying software. Even if the Entity-Relational (ER) data model [1] is the dominant technology for database management systems today, it has limitations in modeling RDF constructs. RDF being unbounded, the resulting data structures are irregular, expressed using different data granularity, deeply nested or even cyclic. As a consequence, it is not possible to easily fix the ""structural view"" of a piece of information (object), which is instead one of the fundaments of traditional RDBMS systems trying to be much narrower and precise as possible and where an update not conforming to a single static schema is rejected. Database systems also optimize data storage and retrieval by knowing ahead of time how records are structured and interrelated and tend to use very inefficient nested SQL SELECT statements to process nested and cyclic structures. All this is too restrictive for RDF data. Like most semi-structured formalisms [2][3] RDF is self-describing. This means that the schema information is embedded with the data, and no a priori structure can be assumed, giving a lot of flexibility to manage any data and deal with changes in the data's structure seamlessly at the application level. The only basic structure available is the RDF graph itself, which allows describing RDF vocabularies as groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources [4]. All new data can be ""safely"" accepted, eventually at the cost of tailoring the queries to the data. On the other side, RDF data management systems must be much more generic and polymorphic like most of dynamically-bound object-oriented systems [5]; changes to the schema are expected to be as frequent as changes to the data itself and could happen while the data is being processed or ingested. A drawback of RDF heterogeneity is that the schema is relatively large compared to the data itself [6]; this in contrast to traditional RDBMS where the data schema is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the data. This also implies that RDF queries over the schema information are as important as queries on the data. Another problem is that most RDF data (e.g. metadata embedded into an HTML page or RSS1.0 news feed) might exist independently of the vocabulary schemas used to mark-up the data, further complicating data structure ""validation"" (RDF Schema validation). This de-coupling aspect also makes the data ""de-normalization"" more difficult [7][8][9]. ""De-normalization"" is needed in RDBMS to overcome query performance penalties caused by the very general ""normalized"" schemas. De-normalization must be done taking into account to how the database will be used and how data is initially structured. In RDF this is not generally possible, unless all the RDF Schema definitions of the classes and properties used are known a-priori and available to the software application. Even if that might be the case, it is not a general rule and it would be too restrictive and make RDF applications extremely fragile. In the simplest and most general case, RDF software must associate the semantics to a given property exclusively using the unique string representation of its URIs. This will not stop of course more advanced and intelligent software to go a step further and retrieve, if available, the schema of the associated namespace declarations for validation, optimization or inference purposes. It is interesting to point out that a large part of queries foreseen for Web applications are information discovery and retrieval queries (e.g. Google) that can ""ignore"" the data schema taxonomy. Simple browsing through the RDF data itself or searching for some sub-string into literals, or using common patterns is generally enough for a large family of RDF applications. On the other hand, we strongly believe that RDBMS has proven to be a very effective and efficient technology to manage large quantities of well-structured data. This will continue to be true for the foreseeable future. We thus see RDF and similar less rigid, or semi-structured data technologies as complementary to traditional RDBMS systems. We expect to see RDF increasingly appear in the middle layer where lightweight systems that focus on interoperability, flexibility and a certain degree of decoupling of rigid formats are desired. We believe that a fundamentally different storage and query architecture is required to support the efficiently and the flexibility of RDF and its query languages. At a minimum such storage system needs to be: Lightweight Native implementation of the graph Fundamentally independent from data structure Allow for very wide ranges in value sizes; where the size distribution is not known in advance, most certainly is not Gaussian and will fluctuate wildly. Be efficient it should not be necessary to retrieve very large volumes of data in order to reconstruct part of the graph. Allow built support for arbitrary complex regular-path-expressions on the graph to match RDF queries like RDQL [50] statement triple-patterns. Have some free-text support Context/provenance/scope or flavoring of triples Furthermore given that RDF and the Semantic Web are relatively new, and will require significant integration and experimentation it is important that its technology matches that of the Internet: Easy to interface to C, Perl and Java at the very least. Ruby, Python, Visual Basic and .NET are a pre. Easy to distribute (part of) the solution across physical machines or locations in order match scaling and operational habits of existing key Internet infrastructure. Very resistant to ""missing links"" and other noise. Contexts and provenance A RDF statement represents a fact that is asserted as true in a certain context space time, situation, scope, etc. The circumstances where the statement has been stated represent its ""contextual"" information [10][11]. For example, it may be useful to track the origin of triples added to the graph, e.g. the URI of the source where triples are defined, e.g. in an RDF/XML file, when and by whom they where added and the expiration date (if any) for the triples. Such context and provenance information can be thought of as an additional and orthogonal dimension to the other components of a triple. The concept is called in the literature ""statement reification"". Context and provenance are currently not included in the RDF standardisation process [48][49], but will hopefully adressed in a next release of the specification. From the application developer point of view there is a clear need for such primitive constructs to layer different levels of semantics on top of RDF which can not be represented in the RDF triples space. Applications normally need to build meta-levels of abstraction over triples to reduce complexity and provide an incremental and scaleable access to information. For example, if a Web robot is processing and syndicating news coming from various on-line newspapers, there will be overlap. An application may decide to filter the news based not only on a timeline or some other property, but perhaps select sources providing only certain information with unique characteristics. This requires the flagging of triples as belonging to different contexts and then describing in the RDF itself the relationships between the contexts. At query time such information can then be used by the application to define a search scope to filter the results. Another common example of the usage of provenance and contextual information is about digital signing RDF triples to provide a basic level of trust over the Semantic. In that case triples could be flagged for example with a PGP key to uniquely identify the source and its properties. There have been several attempts [12][13][14][15] trying to formalize and use contexts and provenance information in RDF but a common agreement has not been reached yet. However, context and provenance information come out as soon as a real application is built using RDF. Some first examples are presented below. Our approach to model contexts and provenance has been simpler and motivated by real-world RDF applications we have developed [16a][16b][16c]. We found that an additional dimension to the RDF triple can be useful or even essential. Given that the usage of full-blown RDF reification is not feasible due to its verbosity and inefficiency we developed a different modeling technique that flags or mark a given statement as belonging to a specific context. First example considers subjective assertions. The Last Minute News (LMN) [16b] and The News Blender (NB) [16c] demos allow an user rating and qualifying the source newspapers. The user can ""say"" that a newspaper is ""liberal"" or ""conservative"". Of course, two users, X and Y, will show two different opinions. Without considering the context, this will result in two triples: Newspaper A -> Quality -> ""liberal"" Newspaper A -> Qu",autonomous vehicle,196,not included

A hierarchical collective agents network (HCAN) is employed as a solution to this problem. The agents network supports multi-sensor registration, real-time sensor/platform cueing, level-2 and level-3 information fusion, and has an arm toward the level-4 fusion objectives. An agent component assembly and decision-support-system-development environment, the 21 Century systemsâ AEDGE software package, is used for the design and implementation of a HCAN-DSS system. The ability to integrate and correlate a vast amounts of disparate information from multiple sensor and heterogeneous data resources with varying degrees of uncertainty in real-time is an impediment issue for missioncritical decision support systems (DSS). For example, in crucial military operations command officers need real-time information and intelligences from various sensors/data resources in a theater of reconnaissance and surveillance to build a whole picture of the battle-space. It is critical for the commanders to know and to understand the relationships among the information collected. Questions are asked: what are the physical and functional constituencies among the objects in a given geographic sector? Are there sequential or temporal dependencies of the objects and what will trigger them? What are the possible consequences of the action and re-actions? Decision making based on these situation assessment and impact assessment (SA/IA) are particularly important for identifying and prioritizing âgapsâ between the operation planning and the real-time interactions. To support making effective SA/IA, a data fusion and decision support system is required to use a set of coherent patterns derived from the available data sets and infer the implications (e.g., causal relations) toward the real world situations. The attribute coherence that is critical to the formation of the meaningful knowledge patterns is often obscure in the data sets obtained from heterogeneous resources. The data collections are often incomplete, imprecise, and inconsistent due to various natural constraints and human faults. Decision makers naturally desire to access large quantities of information expressed in diverse forms. However, as new sensor technology and various information sources have combined to create quantity and diversity, it has become increasingly difficult to provide decision makers with the right information at the right time and in the right quantity and format. Real-time computerized decision support systems are constructed by integrating a number of diverse components from a variety of software modules. Software developers have come to a numerous ways of querying the local and centralized data resources to access and distill the large and diverse information for the purpose of providing effective decision support. Meanwhile DSS are becoming more and more complex in terms of knowing which data resources to connect, how to keep track of the data dynamics, and assess the reliability of information from each resources. These tying links make the use of intelligent agent architecture necessary and desirable for allowing real-time responsibility and adaptive control of the DSS. Many popular agent systems of today deploy agents in a uniform level of operation. The agents respond to the same calls and cooperate at the same time toward the same goal of operation. The architecture endues some difficulties in agent communications and task control. When applied in complex real-time DSS with intensive human and system interactions, the cooperative nature makes the system less robust because the disability of one agent would affect the successive operations of the entire agent assembly. The collective nature of the agents in a HCAN paradigm overcomes some of these difficulties, for example, relieving the burden of data-exchanges between fellow agents by limiting agent communication to vertical layers of the assembly only. The hierarchical architecture simplifies the functional design of the agent interactions and enhances the security and efficiency of the process. The HCAN architecture also strikes a balance between the centralized control and distributed computation by allowing distributive agent operations within layers of the hierarchy and enforcing centralized control between the layers of the hierarchy, thus creating a federated agents integration structure. Basically, the HCAN has the functionalities of. 1). A flexible software architecture for accommodating system augmentation and evolutions; 2). A powerful representation schema for accommodating heterogeneous forms of information; 3). A diverse interface for various input resources, output formats, and human interactions; From: AAAI Technical Report WS-02-15. Compilation copyright Â© 2002, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. 4). An ability of reasoning on incomplete and inconsistent information, and extracting useful knowledge from the data of heterogeneous resources; 5). An ability of incorporating real-time dynamics of information resources into system at time of operation, and promptly adjusting the reasoning mechanisms; 6). An ability of summarizing and refining knowledge extracted, and distinguishing mission and time critical knowledge from insignificant and redundant ones; 7). A capability of supplying meaningful and accurate explanations, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the automated system actions; and 8). A capability of providing adequate control and scrutiny of the system operations w.r.t. environment constrains. There are many sources of uncertainty at different levels of the decision support. For example, even if a situationassessor is aware of the presence of certain objects in the operation space, such as the type of contact, intention, reaction rational, etc., the exact dynamics of the object is still uncertain to the decision maker. While the knowledge about the object dynamics is critical in constructing an optimal strategy of action, various statistical methods and knowledge discovery techniques are applied in the reasoning module. The level of uncertainty forces the reasoning agents to operate with different decision strategies. The 21 Century Systems, Inc. has developed the AEDGE as an open DII-COE and CORBA compliant agentbased environment that enables the development of components-based agent systems. The system is implemented in JavaTM, with Java Database ConnectivityTM for DB access, Java Swing, AWT, and Java3D for visual interfaces, Java Media Framework and Java Speech API for audio/speech interface. AEDGE defines Agents, Entities, Avatars and their interactions with each other and with external sources of information. This standardized architecture allows additional components, such as servicespecific DSS tools, to be efficiently built upon the core functionality. Common interfaces and data structures can be exported to interested parties who wish to extend the architecture with new components, agents, servers, or clients. When the core AEDGE components are bundled with customer-specific components, a clean separation of those components, through APIs, is provided. The AEDGE is based on an extensible multi-component DSS architecture (EMDA, also referred to as the AEDGETM Architecture). The architectures describe the data objects, interfaces, communication mechanisms, component interactions, and integration mechanisms for the AEDGE and its extensions. In the AEDGE architecture, components communicate among each other via the Service Provider/Service Requester Protocol (SPSR). Service providers are components that implement an algorithm or need to share their data (data sources). Service requesters are the components that need a function performed for them by some other component or need to import data from another component. Both service requesters and service providers implement remote interfaces, which enables such components to communicate over a TCP/IP network. The remote interface implementation is currently based on Java RMI (remote method invocation), though the Architecture is not dependent on this implementation. AEDGE provides multiple levels of customization. The subject-matter users are able to build scenarios and scripts or to automatically generate them using the AEDGE-based Scenario Editor. Rules and triggers for agent behaviors can be created and modified by the advanced user. AEDGE also provides APIs for custom extensions of agents, data bridges, and the entity framework. The practical user will enjoy AEDGEâs versatile data connectivity and its near-real-time execution and monitoring of DSS functions. As a built-in bonus, AEDGE provides connections to a number of simulators and data formats, including HLA, DIS, DTED, DBDB2, XML, as well as support for multiple modes of distribution (CORBA, RMI, TCP/IP). As an example of the HCAN design using AEDGE for data fusion and DSS applications, the Advanced Battlestation with Decision Support System (ABS/DSS) which was developed as an operational agent-based C2 team decision support platform for command and control centers aboard aircraft carriers.. The ABS/DSS is based on AEDGEâs implementation of HCAN, and provides consolidated situational awareness through real-time, interactive, agent based decision support coupled with a linked 2D/3D battlespace visualization. Additionally, the ABS/DSS supports shipboard distributed training, train-asyou-fight, with a built-in scenario construction and emulation of friendly and hostile entities. Whether the watchstander is in live-feed mode or in training mode the operation of the agent-based decision support system and the 2D/3D visualization is identical.

For example, calling the getData() command on a sensor component will cause it to later signal a dataReady() event when the hardware interrupt fires. While many components are entirely software based, the combination of split-phase operations and tasks makes this distinction transparent to the programmer. In both cases an event signals that the encryption operation is complete. ADC, ClockC, UART, SlavePin and SpiByteFifo are example hardware abstraction components. TinyOS commands and events are very short, due to limited code space and a finite state machine style of decomposition. The rich event processing model means an event or command call path can traverse several components. The TinyOS component model allows us to easily change the target platform from mote hardware to simulation by only replacing a small number of low-level components. The event-driven execution model can be exploited for efficient eventdriven simulation, and the whole program compilation process can be re-targeted for the simulatorâs storage model and native instruction set. The static component memory model of TinyOS simplifies state management for these large collections. Setting the right level of simulation abstraction can accurately capture the behavior and interactions of TinyOS applications. Figure 1.3: TinyOS Structure (Consist of scheduler and graph of components) 2.3 TOSSIM: A Simulator for TinyOS Sensor Networks The Necessity of Network Simulation: The emergence of wireless sensor networks brought many open issues to network designers. Traditionally, the three main techniques for analyzing the performance of wired and wireless networks are analytical methods, computer simulation, and physical measurement. However, because of many constraints imposed on sensor networks, such as energy limitation, decentralized collaboration and fault tolerance, algorithms for sensor networks tend to be quite complex and usually defy analytical methods that have been proved to be fairly effective for traditional networks. Furthermore, few sensor networks have come into existence, for there are still many unsolved research problems, so measurement is virtually impossible. It appears that simulation is the only feasible approach to the quantitative analysis of sensor networks. The event-driven nature of sensor networks means that testing an individual mote is insufficient. Programs must be tested at scale and in complex and rich conditions to capture a wide range of interactions. Deploying hundreds of motes is a daunting task, the focus of work shifts from research to maintenance, which is time-consuming due to the failure rate of individual motes. A simulator can deal with these difficulties, by providing controlled, reproducible environments, by enabling access to tools such as debuggers, and by postponing deployment until code is well tested and algorithms are understood. TOSSIM: TOSSIM is a discrete event simulator for TinyOS sensor networks. Instead of compiling a TinyOS application for a mote, users can compile it into the TOSSIM framework, which runs on a PC. This allows users to debug, test, and analyze algorithms in a controlled and repeatable environment. As TOSSIM runs on a PC, users can examine their TinyOS code using debuggers and other development tools. TOSSIMâs primary goal is to provide a high fidelity simulation of TinyOS applications. For this reason, it focuses on simulating TinyOS and its execution, rather than simulating the real world. While TOSSIM can be used to understand the causes of behavior observed in the real world, it does not capture all of them, and should not be used for absolute evaluations.

Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a ubiquitous platform recently, and issues regarding the efficiency of energy usage by these devices play a very important role. These devices are equipped with negligible or less amount of battery power to sustain for a long time. Not only that, in most of the scenarios, where these networks are deployed it is infeasible or impossible sometimes to replace the battery power of the sensor nodes. One of the most fundamental aspects for energy consumption in sensor nodes is communication, other than sensing and computation costs. Optimization of communication costs is thus essential, which is a direct consequence of betterment of routing techniques in this type of wireless networks. A major portion of my contribution in this project deals with designing data gathering schemes for wireless sensor networks and optimization of routing techniques, described below. The first in this queue was the HDS or âHybrid Data Gathering Schemeâ. Published in the International Conference of Distributed Computing and Internet Technology (ICDCITâ10), this work is a novel approach in minimizing not only the communication / energy overhead but also guarantees a minimal energy-latency product. It also distributes the energy consumption by the nodes by rotating the leader node, so as to increase the uniformity of energy content in the nodes. The uniform distribution of energy content in the nodes also helps to lessen the chances of a black hole or a sinkhole problem. The HDS protocol is based on the hybrid combination of two algorithms, SHORT and LBERRA. The LBERRA scheme is used to subdivide the sensor field into predefined clusters, and SHORT is applied to form a binary tree spanning the nodes. There are two types of leader nodes: one for each cluster, forming the root of the tree and the other one is the âsinkâ communicating the gathered data to the Base Station. In each of the data gathering rounds the leader node is changed The second work was related to optimization of routing chain through heuristic techniques. Firstly, I applied Particle Swarm Optimization to create the most energy efficient paths for communication in the sensor field. Then, I investigated the use of Genetic Algorithms (hybridized with simulated annealing) in solving the same problem. In these works, I not only devised the algorithm for the minimum-energy path formation, but also coded it in nesC discussed in the earlier section. The implementation and simulation in nesC guarantees the hardware feasibility of the algorithm in sensor nodes. Packet loss rates were also studied with varying network topology and signal strengths in communication between particular sensor nodes. In all the cases, a standard background noise was considered. This work followed a series of publications including three international conferences and two international journals. An extension of this work was to create energy efficient data gathering trees. Most algorithms developed in literature used greedy algorithms to construct routing trees which in most of the cases did not result in near-optimal energy usage. âROOTâ or âROuting through Optimized Treesâ was an answer to this need.

These architectures increase the deployment and the runtime possibilities because of the number of existing sites. Indeed, the simple separation of the various functional levels as it is done in a classical architecture (Data, Treatment, Presentation) is not enough and the choice of the site of deployment or runtime becomes significant for the optimization of the production of the system. In these architectures, these decisions of distribution are generally made during the implementation phase. The conceptual structures offered to designers to allow them to express their needs for distribution (concepts of packages, business component,..) do not match with the rules used by developers for building their distributed components [Snene04B]. In fact, software components represent a single and autonomous concept of real world. They encapsulate all the data concerning this concept including name, goal, behavior and all other information with regard to them. In fact, a software component is a set of objects that can be physically deployed on two or several sites. It is usually made up of one or of several distributed components that offer together the various aspects of distribution necessary to the software component.

While RFID technology is improving rapidly, a reliable deployment of this technology is still a significant challenge impeding wide-spread adoption. This research investigates system software solutions for achieving a highly reliable deployment that mitigates inherent unreliability in RFID technology. 
We have considered two different problem domains for large scale RFID deployment. One is item tracking and the other is guidance-monitoring. 
The basic contribution of our work is providing novel middleware solution that is able to serve the application taking into account the inherent unreliability of RFID technology. Our path abstraction that uses the physical flow of data as an ally to generate a logical system level flow enhances the performance in many ways. The contributions of this dissertation are summarized below: 
Defining novel system architecture for item tracking applications: We have defined a system architecture referred to as Reliable Framework for RFID (RF2ID) that takes into account the unreliability of RFID devices and provides a scalable, reliable system architecture for item tracking applications. It uses a distributed system abstraction named Virtual Reader (VR) that handles RFID data in different geographic locations. Virtual Path (VPath) is the abstraction that creates channels among the VRs and facilitates a data flow oriented data management in the system. 
Implementation of RF2ID: We have implemented RF2ID that is able to incorporate physical RFID devices as well as emulated devices for scalability study taking into account various real world challenges of large scale RFID deployment. 
Load Shedding Based Resource Management: RF2ID requires a mechanism to handle unexpected system load in the presence of asynchronous arrival of data items. Space based load shedding and time based load shedding techniques are used in RF2ID. The basic idea is to exploit the VR and Vpath abstraction to intelligently share the load among the VRs in the presence of high system load, and yet provide some guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). 
Architecture for GuardianAngel: We define an architecture for an indoor pervasive environment which provides novel system abstraction and communication framework. The layered architecture has distributed computational elements known as the virtual station (VS) that are in charge of serving different regions of the environment. The Mobile Objects (MO) are the physical and logical entities that use sensing device and traverse the environment. The environment itself is tagged with RFID. The MO uses its sensing device to make guidance decisions locally. The VS keeps status information of MOs and keeps coarse grained information of the MO over time and space providing a virtual location for each MO. 
Implementation of GuardianAngel: We have implemented the GuardianAngle system as defined by the architecture. We have used a testbed that uses real RFID readers and tags in the pervasive environment in a limited laboratory setup. We have also developed a distributed system setup using emulated tags for a scalability study of the proposed architecture. We have also implemented a prototype application, to test its feasibility in the real world. 
Evaluation of the system: We have conducted extensive evaluation using the real RFID testbed as well as scalability study using emulated readers and tags. The evaluation using the real RFID tags and readers gives us the credibility of the system under various environmental considerations. The large scale experimentations provide us with scalability and feasibility study to strengthen our limited resource study using real RFID testbed.

GBDE is a strong cryptographic facility for denying unauthorised access to data stored on a ââcoldââ disk for decades and longer. GBDE operates on the disk(-partition) level allowing any type of file system or database to be protected. A significant focus has been put on the practical aspects in order to make it possible to deploy GBDE in the real world. 1 1. Losing data left and right In the last couple of years, gentlemen of the press have repeatedly been able to expose how laptop computers containing highly sensitive or very valuable information have been lost to carelessness, theft and in some cases espionage. [THEREG] The scope of the problem is very hard to gauge, since it is not a subject which the involved persons and, in particular, institutions are at all keen on having exposed. However, a few data points have been uncovered, revealing that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation loses, on average, one laptop every three days. [DOJ0227] When a computer is lost, stolen or misplaced, it is very often the case that the computer hardware represents a value which is insignificant compared to the value of the disk contents. More often than not, the only reason the press heard about it was that the material on the disk was ââhotââ enough to make the loss of control rattle people at government level. While it is easy to blame these incidents on ââuser errorââ, as is generally done, doing so makes it a very hard problem to fix. Human nature being what it is, seems to remain just that. In the absence of technical counter measures, administrative measures have been applied, generally with abysmal results. In one case, a bureaucracy has handled the problem according to what could easily be 1 This software was developed for the FreeBSD Project by Poul-Henning Kamp and NAI Labs, the Security Research Division of Network Associates, Inc. under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035 (ââCBOSSââ), as part of the DARPA CHATS research program. mistaken for the plot from a classic Buster Keaton movie: First a laptop was forgotten and lost in a taxi-cab. New policy: always drive your own car if you bring your laptop. Then a car was stolen, including the laptop in the trunk. New policy: always bring your laptop with you. The next laptop was stolen from a pub while the owner was bowing to the pressures of nature. New policy: employees are not to carry their own laptops outside the office at any time.

All requests must be filed 3 days in advance on form ##-#. [PRIV] 2. Protecting disk contents Protecting the contents of a computerâs disk can in practice be done in two ways: by physically securing the disk or by encrypting its contents. Physical protection is increasingly impossible to implement. It used to be that disk drives could only be moved by forklift, but these days a gigabyte disk is the size, but not quite yet the thickness, of a postage stamp. While computers can be tied down with wires and bars can be put in front of windows, such measures are generally not acceptable, or at least not judged economically justified in any but the most sensitive operations. That leaves encryption of the disk contents as the only practical and viable mode of protection, and both the practicality and the viability has been somewhat in doubt. Until recently, nearly all aspects of cryptography were a highly political issue, this has eased a lot in the last couple of years and there now ââonlyââ remain a number of rather fundamental questions in the area of law enforcement and human rights, which are still unsettled. With the political issues mostly out of the way, the next roadblock is practical: While use of cryptography can never be entirely transparent, the overhead and workload it brings must be reasonable. 2.1. Application level encryption Encryption at the application level has been available for a number of years, primarily in the form of the PGP [PGP] program. This is about as intrusive and demanding as things can get: the user is explicitly responsible for doing both encryption and decryption and must enter the pass-phrase for every operation. 2 Apart from the inconvenience of this extra workload, many org anisations would trust their users neither to get this right nor even to want to get it right. From an institutional point of view it is important that cryptographic data protection can be made mandatory. 2.2. Filesystem level encryption Encryption at the file system level is a tried and acknowledged method of providing protection, but it suffers from a number of drawbacks, mainly because no mainstream file systems offer encryption. Encrypting file systems are speciality items, which means increased cost and system administration problems of all sorts. And since practically all operating systems use their own file system format, cross platform fully functional file systems are very rare. This means that a typical organisation will have to operate with a handful of different methods of encryption, which translates to system administration overhead, user confusion and extra effort to pass security and ISO9000 audits. A secondary, but increasingly important issue is that data which are stored in databases on raw disk, operating system paging areas and other such data are not protected by a cryptographic file system. To protect these would mean adding yet another set of encryption methods, which leads to a situation which is very hard to handle practically and administratively. Finally, file systems have a complex programming interface to the operating system, which traditionally 2 Interestingly, this is so impractical in real world use that various applications with PGP support resort to caching the pass-phrase at the application level, thereby weakening the protection a fair bit. has been subject to both version skew and compatibility problems. 2.3. Disk level encryption Encryption at the disk level can protect all data, no matter how they are stored, file system, database or otherwise. To a user, encryption at the disk level would require authentication before the computer can be used, everything functioning transparently thereafter, with all disk content automatically protected. Given that the programming interface for a disk device is very simple and practically identical between operating systems, there are no technical reasons why the same implementation could not be used across several operating systems. All in all this is a close to ideal solution from an operational point of view. There are significant implementation issues however. In difference from the higher levels, encryption at the disk level has no way of knowing a priori which sectors contain data and which sectors do not; neither is knowledge available about access patterns or relationships between individual sectors. Where application level or file system based encryption schemes can key each file individually, a disk based encryption must key each and every sector individually, ev en if it is not currently used to hold data. It has been argued that the encryption ideally should happen in the disk-drive, and while there are steps in this direction, they do unfortunately seem to have been made for the wrong reasons by the wrong people [CPRM], and have consequently not gained acceptance. Provided the owner of the computer remains in control of the encryption, I see no reason why encryption in the disk drives should not gain acceptance in the future. 3. Why this is not quite simple Several implementations have been produced which implement a disk encryption feature by running the user provided passphrase through a good quality one-way hash function and used the output as a key to encrypt all the sectors using a standard block cipher in CBC mode. A per sector IV for the encryption is typically derived from the passphrase and sector address using a one-way hash function. Tw o typical examples are [CGD] and [LOOPAES]. Unfortunately this approach suffers from a number of significant drawbacks, both in terms of cryptographic strength and deployability. For data to stay protected for decades or even lifetimes, sufficient margin must exist not only for technological advances in brute force technology, but also for theoretical advances in cryptoanalytical attacks on the algorithms used. Protecting a modern disk, typically having a few hundred millions of sectors, with the same single 128 or 256 bits of key material offers an incredibly large amount of data for statistical, differential or probabilistic attacks in the future. Worse, because the sectors contain file system or database data and meta data which are optimised for speed, the plaintext sector data typically have both a high degree of structure and a high predictability, offering ample opportunities for statistical and known plaintext attacks. This author would certainly not trust data so protected to be kept secret for more than maybe fiv e or ten years against a determined attacker. But far more damning to this method is that there can only be one single passphrase for the disk. This effectively rules out the ability for an organisation to implement any kind of per-user or multilevel key management scheme: the only possible scheme is ââone key per diskââ. Add to this that to change the passphrase the entire disk would have to be decrypted and re-encrypted, and we have a model which may work in theory, and can be made to work in practice for a determined individual, but which would fast become an operational liability for any org anisation. 4.

The explosion of data is making storage system a strategic investment priority in the enterprise world. The revenue created by storage system industry steadily increases from $14.2 Billion in 2004 to over $18.4 Billion in 2007. As a key component of enterprise systems, reliable storage systems are critical. However, despite the efforts put into building robust storage systems, as the size and complexity of storage systems have grown to an unprecedented level, storage system problems are common. Unfortunately, many aspects of storage system problems are still not well understood, and most of previous studies only focus on one component - disk drives. 
To better understand storage system problems, we analyzed the failure characteristics of the core part of storage system - the storage subsystem, which contains disks and all components providing connectivity and usage of disk to the entire storage system. More specifically, we analyzed the storage system logs collected from about 39,000 storage systems commercially deployed at various customer sites. The data set covers a period of 44 months and includes about 1,800,000 disks hosted in about 155,000 storage shelf enclosures. Our study reveals many interesting findings, providing useful guideline for designing reliable storage systems. Some of the major findings include: (1) In addition to disk failures that contribute to 20â55% of storage subsystem failures, other components such as physical interconnects and protocol stacks also account for significant percentages of storage subsystem failures. (2) Each individual storage subsystem failure type and storage subsystem failure as a whole exhibit strong self-correlations. In addition, these failures exhibit bursty patterns. (3) Storage subsystems configured with dual-path interconnects experience 30â40% lower failure rates than those with a single interconnect. (4) Spanning disks of a RAID group across multiple shelves provides a more resilient solution for storage subsystems than within a single shelf. 
As we found out that storage subsystem problems are far beyond disk failures, we extend the scope of study to various storage system problems, and study the characteristics of storage system problem troubleshooting from various dimensions. Using a large set (636,108) of real world customer problem cases reported from 100,000 commercially deployed storage systems in the last two years, the analysis show that while some problems are either benign, or resolved automatically, many others can take hours or days of manual diagnosis to fix. For modern storage systems, hardware failures and misconfigurations dominate customer cases, but software failures take longer time to resolve. Interestingly, a relatively significant percentage of cases are because customers lack sufficient knowledge about the system. We also evaluate the potential of using storage system logs to resolve these problems. Our analysis shows that a failure message alone is a poor indicator of root cause, and that combining failure messages with multiple log events can improve problem root cause prediction by a factor of three. 
One key finding is that storage system logs contain useful information for narrowing down the root cause, while they are challenging to analyze manually because they are noisy and the useful log events are often separated by hundreds of irrelevant log events. Motivated by this finding, we designed and implemented an automatic tool, called Log Analyzer, to improve problem troubleshooting process. By applying statistical analysis techniques, the Log Analyzer can automatically infer the dependency relationship between log events, and identify the key log events that capture the essential system states related to storage system problems. By combining classic unsupervised classification techniques - hierarchical clustering with the event ranking techniques, the Log Analyzer can also identify recurrent storage system problems based on similar log patterns, so that previous diagnosis efforts can be systematically retrieved and leveraged. We train the Log Analyze with 18,878 week-long storage system logs and evaluate it with 164 real-world problem cases. The evaluation indicates that the Log Analyzer can effectively reduce the log event number to 3.4%. For most of the 16 real-world problem cases manually annotated with 1â3 key log events, the Log Analyzer accurately ranked the key log events within top 3 without a priori knowledge on how important the events are. For the other 148 problem cases with diagnosis and with root cause information, the Log Analyzer effectively grouped problem cases with the same root cause together with 63â93% accuracy, significantly outperforming other three alternative solutions which only achieve 30â46% accuracy.",autonomous vehicle,202,not included

The microprocessor-based Sequencer is meant to replace traditional, electromechanical sequencers, which are based on relays, contactors, limit switches and other similar devices. The INTEL 8085A microprocessor, combined with interface chips like the AD7575 ADC, the MAX378 multiplexer was used to implement the sequencer. Software was programmed into 2716 EPROM. Actuators and signal conditioning circuits were also designed and implemented. The implemented system was tested and the performance was found to be satisfactory. Introduction Background to the problem : According to Nwachuku[1] microprocessors are the state of the art in electronics digital systemsâ design and the Nigerian Engineer, like his counterpart the world over, has no choice but to become interested in them. He contended further that, because of the nature of the microprocessor and its versatility, it becomes possible for the Nigerian engineer to device products to meet local needs using imported chips. This according to him, is the direction of technological development ..In the advanced industrialized and newly industrialized countries, the last couple of decades have seen the extensive application of microprocessors and computers to automate production processes. Specifically, the microprocessor acts as a micro-controller with a fixed program. Here, the microprocessor application system in most cases, involves the determination of values of physical parameters like temperature, pressure, and so on. In Nigeria, not much seems to have been achieved in this area. Some big manufacturing companies in both the public and private sectors of the Nigerian economy have had to change from along monitoring and control of plant operations to microprocessor/computer-based systems. Most of them are based on the programmable logic controllers (PLCs). But all these analog to digital (microprocessor /computer-based) implementations are mostly carried out by foreign firms and personnel, bringing along with them, their designed hardware and software. Even at that, not much is known to have been achieved in the area of deploying this latest-in-technology to improve the production processes of small-scale industries. This project was conceived as a result of a realization of this obvious short-coming. The nature of the problem: All over the world, countries have come to recognize the leading role which small-scale industries play in their economic development. They furnish over forty-percent (40%) of a nationâs output of goods and they also provide a substantial amount of total employment in an economy. A realization of this obvious fact has made the Federal Government of Nigeria to lay emphasis on the need to support Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in order that they act as catalyst for Nigeriaâs industrial and economic growth. For example, the Federal Government of Nigeria has floated a Bank of Industries and has set up a Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) with the objective of improving the performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) towards achieving rapid industrialization of Nigeria and for the reversal of its over dependence on imports. Advanced Materials Research Online: 2007-06-15 ISSN: 1662-8985, Vols. 18-19, pp 107-110 doi:10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.18-19.107 Â© 2007 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland All rights reserved. No part of contents of this paper may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means without the written permission of Trans Tech Publications Ltd, www.scientific.net. (Semanticscholar.org-19/03/20,17:18:59) However, it must be realized that, the success of these initiatives and of Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMIs) themselves, would depend on indigenous locally developed production processes and technologies. Failures of this class of industries in the past have largely been attributed to their over dependence on imported production processes, technologies, and by extension, on imported plants, equipments and machines. The Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) of Nigeria have identified the dearth of process equipment and machinery as the bane of Nigeriaâs under-utilization of her agricultural and mineral raw materials. This now places a huge burden on the Nigerian engineer to now start to design, implement, and practicalize new production processes, machines, equipment and plants that can be deployed by the old and emerging SMIs. The Federal Government of Nigeria seems to have set the ball rolling by the establishment of a National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP). The literature is replete with works on interfacing microprocessors with real life situations which is exemplified by the following: Hosier[2] reviewed briefly, the issues that has to be addressed when interfacing a microprocessor to perform real world monitoring and control operations. Anazia [3] gave an overview of the status of microprocessor applications in industrial process control as it relates to the Guinness Plant in Benin-City, Nigeria. A PC-Based Data Acquisition and Supervisory Control system for a Small-Scale Industry was designed and implemented by [4]. Mansfield[5] described the use of transducers for industrial measurement purposes. Program and Data Stores design and Input/Output interfacing were well treated by Short[6]. Gregory[7] explained in good details signal conditioning circuits design. General description of the microprocessor based sequencer The groundnut-oil production plant operates as a series of logically controlled sequence of states; for example, agitator ON, crusher OFF and so on; the duration of each state being determined by sensor signals, for example, temperature or pressure; these sequence of states were transferred into software. The software part (application program), in consonance with the process-sequential flowchart (SFC) that describes the operation of the plant was written in assembler. A major part of the plant consists of electrical and mechanical components like motors which are controlled by electro-mechanical relays, these in turn are operated by signals from the microprocessor; therefore, OUTPUT INTERFACE circuits were designed. Other signals are fed to the microprocessor from temperature, pressure, and other sensors; INPUT INTERFACE circuits were therefore, also designed. The microprocessor system must have memory for storing the application program and for implementing intermediate computations and such other operations. INPUT transducersâ outputs are memory-mapped. The Y2 output of the 74ALS138 decoder that was used addresses a memory address range of 1000Hex to 17FFHex. Therefore, the six (6) input transducers reside at addresses 1000H, 1001H, 1002H, 1003H, 1004H and 1005H respectively. The analog-to-digital converter converts input voltages of between 0volts and 5volts to binary outputs of between 00000000 and 11111111, that is, between 00Hex to FFHex. The output ports (74LS373s) were assigned to a separate address space different from that occupied by main memory; hence, they were isolated or standard I/O. Therefore, the designed and implemented system is as shown in block diagrammatic form, in Fig. 1. Description of the Designed and Implemented System In Fig. 1, block 1 represents the transducers. Block 2 represents the signal conditioning circuits that condition the transducersâ signals to match the multiplexerâs-MAX 378(block 3) inputs. The combination of the multiplexer and the sample and hold-AD781 JN(block 4) selects and holds an input for the analog-to-digital converter-AD7575 JN (block 5) to convert for the input ports (block 6). Block 7 (INTEL 8085A) is the microprocessor subsystem. Block 8 is an address/data bus decoder (74ALS373), while block 9 is an address decoder (74ALS138) for the memory subsystem(blocks 10-4118 and 11-2716).

At the same time, the continued growth of the Internet/WEB and its associated standard developments leads to new ways of world-wide information communication, distribution and access to information. This paper introduces to the various developments undertaken in the VEGA 1 project for a tighter integration of STEP, CORBA and WEB technologies within a DIS . Thus, the VEGA platform will allow both the support of distributed heterogeneous and interoperable client/server information systems (through CORBA) and the support of WEB based access to information and services through an Internet based navigation, building upon CGI and Java technologies. 1. Context and problematical issues The Large Scale Engineering (LSE) and Manufacturing universe is nowadays facing an increasing competitive environment where flexibility and adaptability to change are the bound paths to success, leading companies to renew their way of working. This is due to economical and technological drivers. Indeed, industrial enterprises are now devoted to the specification, design and construction of still larger and more complex manufacturing products: it has become no more possible to a single even-wide enterprise to take in charge the realisation of the whole products, both for financial reasons and because the required skills are not all within the enterprise. Thus, companies and SMEs ( Small and Medium Enterprises ) are now on the way of constituting virtual enterprises (VEs) for each new project. In a VE, contractors, partners, suppliers and customers form a temporary aggregation of non co-located actors dealing with the same product, but focusing on their core domain of competence for the shared profitability of industrial projects. At the same time, current progress in IT , providing more reliable and relevant mechanisms and software tools, the development of sophisticated new frameworks in client/server applications, and the continued growth of the Internet enable improved business processes and provide organisations with new business opportunities. Companies are now widely deploying their applications in Internet and Intranet 4 environments, assembling advanced IT based architectures encompassing among others networking, distributed information systems and concurrent engineering. In such a context, the VEGA project is developing a mandatory infrastructure for the support of the LSE business processes, particularly on the base of main standards for information modelling and exchange, with STEP (ISO 10303) or the IFC developed by the IAI , distribution and interoperability mechanisms with the OMG 6 CORBA and IIOP de facto standards, and WEB technology based on HTTP /CGI and Java. VEGA intends to cover the general needs of companies in VEs and Intranets, with a focus on the Building & Construction sector. Its main objective is to provide an information management architecture to guaranty interoperability among various software components running on different platforms, targeting STEP distributed technologies as an approach to bridge the gap between multiple and delocalised software systems in the construction industry. Within VEGA, the development of the DIS is a first approach towards an end-user oriented service for access to information through various forms. In the AEC field, large projects require the involvement of many body entities (client, architect, design engineers, various technical engineers, etc.) sitting at various locations, with different views and needs on the project, and managing different forms of documents like textual documents, structured documents, drawings, and so on. Dealing with all these kinds of information representations on the client side lead to consider, as far as possible, standardised front-end services. Access to information can be related to EDI 9 too. Until now, EDI has always been considered as a technology typically based on EDIFACT syntax and rules. But EDI can be considered as a kind of generic term, including all aspects of technical and commercial information exchange without mandatory requirements with respect to specific communication technology. Indeed, EDI can be considered from two different points of view: â¢ the first one is a rather conceptual one: the EDI is a structured electronic exchange of data of any type between computer applications of parties involved in a transaction ; â¢ the second is an operational one, where we consider means to realise the task as announced in the first point of view. With respect to these operational means, the Internet is nowadays more and more acknowledged as the common medium to support communication facilities within the development of client/server applications that deserve the larger audience. The WEB technology builds upon HTTP to provide the users with high-level graphical applications independent of the underlying client platform. Furthermore, the Java language now simplifies the development of WEB applications through the power and flexibility of a real object-oriented language. The Intranet perspective enfavours the use of WEB technologies on LANs 10 on a company scale, whether it be real or virtual. Therefore, a different approach has been applied in the VEGA DIS, considering EDI in the broad sense and consequently managing EDI messages through distributed networked infrastructures, emerging WEB standards (mainly HTML and VRML formats), and WEB technologies like CGI and Java. 2. Integration of new technologies in the VEGA project 2.1 Overview of the VEGA project As previously mentioned, the VEGA 11 project objective is to develop an IT platform enabling companies in a VE to work together. VEGA leans on available technology, and extend their capabilities as needed for engineering collaboration in a flexible distributed environment. To address the problem of information sharing, VEGA deals with 3 different technologies: â¢ product-data modelling for the specification of meaningful project information; â¢ middleware technology for the distribution of project information; â¢ workflow management for the control of the flow of information and work in the VE. The VEGA platform relies on high level open standards for the three technologies listed above, including STEP and particularly EXPRESS for the neutral specification of product model data, CORBA for communication between distributed applications and distribution of objects over networks, workflow technology as defined by the WfMC 12 for design of process control, and information standards like SGML 13 or various WEB de facto standards for the support of valueadded distributed information services (exchange of administrative messages, document handling, presentation of information). Thus, VEGA is currently elaborating the fundamental grounds for distributed architectures, defining a service layered on top of CORBA (the COAST â COrba Access to STEP models [2]), for remote data access and manipulation of information models defined by explicit meta-models (or schemata) satisfying the STEP EXPRESS semantics. 2.2 STEP and the IAI If different software applications need to communicate and inter-operate, they first need to share the same information, without misunderstanding or loss of semantics. This implies a common way to represent and exchange the semantics. Such issues have led to dramatic research efforts to achieve effective product data exchanges, standardisation of methodologies, languages and technologies, especially in the context of PDT , among them: â¢ STEP ([3], [4]), developed in ISO TC184/SC4 16 for the product data representation and exchange. It allows the expression in a uniform and complete way of all the information required for a product life-cycle (especially through the EXPRESS language [5]), and supplies means for exchanging data physical files [6] and sharing product databases [7] with models and applications independent mechanisms. STEP is today deeply used for real world product information modelling, communication and interpretation. â¢ IFC [8], another major effort currently undertaken by a non-profit alliance (IAI) of the building industry including architects and engineers, building clients, software vendors, and so on. The main IAI objective is to specify the IFC as a universal model to be a basis for collaborative work in the building industry and consequently to improve communication, productivity, delivery time, cost, and quality throughout the design, construction, operation and maintenance life cycle of buildings. STEP and IAI share the same goals, i.e. application interoperability; data exchange and actor cooperation, but differ in their respective processes. The IAI promote a bottom-up approach, with an iterative and incremental development for fast implementation. STEP is a long-term project, with a top-down approach and is concerned with broad standardisation. The IAI, having a formal liaison status with STEP has partially adopted the STEP technology, mainly through an EXPRESS representation of the IFC. In the future, an integration of the IFC within STEP is planned. As an initiative driven by leading companies, the IAI is pushing the IFC as a de facto standard in the Building industry in a very near future. A key point of the VEGA infrastructure is to use PDT and especially EXPRESS to describe and store meaningful product information.

As other countries globally, UK is keen for economic development and investment in smart city missions to create interest in monetary environment and inward investment. This paper explores the driving forces of smart road transport transformation and implementation in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: The study involved interviews with sixteen professionals from the UK road transport sector. A semi-structured interview technique was used to collect expertsâ perception, which was then examined using content analysis. Findings: The results of the study revealed that the technological advancement is a key driver. The main challenges faced for the implementation of smart city elements in the UK road network are: lack of investment; maintenance; state of readiness and the awareness of the smart road transport concept. The study concludes that an understanding of the concept of smart cities from a road transport perspective is very important to create awareness of the benefits and the way it works. A wider collaboration between every sector is crucial to create a successful smart city. Originality/value: The study contributes to the field of digitalisation of road transport sector. This paper reveals the key driving forces of smart road transport transformation, the current status of smart road transport implementation in UK and challenges of the smart road transport development in the UK. Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ecaam 2 Introduction Enormous global urbanisation and growth has caused migration of people in urban areas and spatial development of urban infrastructure. According to Obaidat and Nicopolitidis (2016), 85-90% of the world population evolution is a result of a 21 st century cities. Therefore, smart cities are being created from scratch or being developed gradually by improving the prevailing cities infrastructure and primary resources. A study of McKinsey Global Instituteâs by Department for Business innovation and Skills (2013) shows that more than 50% of the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is generated in the 190 major cities in the developed countries compare to 22 largest cities in the developing countries. However, the increase of growth in the developed countries is healthy but this phenomena also set a high expectation on public services and the quality of the urban infrastructure and environment. Due to the urbanisation, more problems such as overpopulation, pollutions, scarcity of natural resources, public and private services are being created (Yigitcanlar et. al. 2020, Dameri, 2014). Smart cities are an emerging strategy to mitigate the problems generated by the rapid urban population growth and rapid urbanization (Prakash, 2019). A âsmart cityâ is defined as an urban area that is highly innovative in terms of overall facilities, ecological real estate, communication and market feasibility (Chirisa et al, 2016). Also, smart cities is defined as âa place where the traditional networks and services are made more efficient with the use of digital and telecommunication technologies, for the benefits of its inhabitants and businessesâ (Kumar et al., 2018). Whereas BSI (2014) noted that smart cities as an effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in a built environment to deliver sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens. From the above three definitions, it could be inferred that smart cities are cities that make use of physical, digital and human systems in order to enable sustainability and efficiency for the citizens within that city. The economic growth of any country is supported by its good infrastructure. The United Kingdom (UK) has strategic roads, railway and airports; however, it is one of the top 10 most congested country in the world (Korosec, 2018). According to ONS (2017), the population in the UK in 2016 was 65.6 million which was the largest ever. It is also projected that the population in the UK would grow, reaching over 74 million by 2039. Due to the population rise amalgamated with increase of cars on the road, which has increased by 4.6% higher than the previous peak in 2016 (Department of Transport, 2017), the present UK transport system faces many challenges. The UK road transportation system is gradually taking steps to overcome the problems. As road transport is a significant source of both safety and environmental concerns. This research aims to explore the driving forces of smart road transport transformation, and implementation in the UK along with the challenges faced. In doing so the next section delves into the relevant literature review followed by methodology and findings. The paper finally concludes with recommendations. 2. Literature review An extensive review of literature on drivers, current status of smart cities and the challenges are discussed in this section. Three main drivers include: technology, environment, and socioeconomy (See Table 1). The technological advancement is clearly seen as strong impact on the cities in the recent years. It can be seen clearly that, the communication technologies (ICT) develops city management, enhances technical and social networks, and urban affordability. Within the technology as a driver, the review of literature revealed that technologies such as Big Data, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are widely Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ecaam 3 implemented within the smart cities context. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on the UK smart road transport sector.

Software production in automotive domain comprises three stages: Developing automotive functions as Simulink models, generating code from the models, and deploying the resulting code on hardware devices. Automotive software artifacts are subject to three rounds of testing corresponding to the three production stages: Model-in-the-Loop (MiL), Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testing. Objective We study testing of continuous controllers at the Model-in-Loop (MiL) level where both the controller and the environment are represented by models and connected in a closed loop system. These controllers make up a large part of automotive functions, and monitor and control the operating conditions of physical devices. Method We identify a set of requirements characterizing the behavior of continuous controllers, and develop a search-based technique based on random search, adaptive random search, hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms to automatically identify worst-case test scenarios which are utilized to generate test cases for these requirements. Results We evaluated our approach by applying it to an industrial automotive controller (with 443 Simulink blocks) and to a publicly available controller (with 21 Simulink blocks). Our experience shows that automatically generated test cases lead to MiL level simulations indicating potential violations of the system requirements. Further, not only does our approach generate significantly better test cases faster than random test case generation, but it also achieves better results than test scenarios devised by domain experts. Finally, our generated test cases uncover discrepancies between environment models and the real world when they are applied at the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) level. Conclusion We propose an automated approach to MiL testing of continuous controllers using search. The approach is implemented in a tool and has been successfully applied to a real case study from the automotive domain.",autonomous vehicle,207,not included

Patrick Leserf (ESTACA) Trade-off analysis with SysML and Papyrus : a drone application Obtaining the set of trade-off architectures from a SysML model is an important objective for the system designer. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology combining SysML with the variability concept and multiobjectives optimization techniques. An initial SysML model is completed with variability information to show up the different alternatives for component redundancy and selection from a library. The constraints and objective functions are also added to the initial SysML model, with an optimization context. Then a representation of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is generated with an algorithm from the optimization context and solved with an existing solver. The presentation will illustrate our methodology by designing an Embedded Cognitive Safety System (ECSS). From a component repository and redundancy alternatives, the best design alternatives are generated in order to minimize the total cost and maximize the estimated system reliability. BenoÃ®t Combemale (IRISA) Using models for a broader engagement in smart systems. Various disciplines use models for different purposes. While engineering models, including software engineering models, are often developed to guide the construction of a non-existent system, scientific models, in contrast, are created to better understand a natural phenomenon (i.e., an already existing system). An engineering model may incorporate scientific models to build a smart system. This talk proposes a vision promoting an approach that synergistically combines engineering and scientific models to enable broader engagement of end users in smart systems, informed decision-making based on more-accessible scientific models and data, and automated feedback to the engineering models to support dynamic adaptation of smart systems. To support this vision, we identify a number of challenges to be addressed with particular emphasis on the socio-technical benefits of modeling.

Michael Siegel (OFFIS) CPSE-Labs experiments of Germany North centre: The Maritime Architecture Framework (MAF) and eMaritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR) The Maritime Architecture Framework (MAF) is a stakeholder-oriented CPS architecture framework for existing and future maritime CPS and services. MAF provides the conceptual basis, methods, tools and technologies to define, document, and align existing or future CPS architectures and architectural reference models for e-navigation and e-maritime applications. The MAF is a key enabler in the maritime domain for system harmonization, interoperability and standardization. The MAF is also a reference for the definition and design of testbeds for enavigation and e-maritime systems and services. It helps to define the context, to check completeness and provides a semantic basis to discuss the outcome and results. Additionally it offers a semantic basis for integration of testbeds e.g. for larger demonstrators. To support the development of maritime CPS â i.e. the integration of heterogeneous systems of the maritime transportation space , the Design Centre North provides the eMaritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR) for rapid prototyping in simulation environments and testing in real world environments. This talk gives an overview about the background, context and concepts of the MAF and why testbed environments (e.g. eMIR) for the development, integration testing and demonstration for CPS must take into account and support the design aspects of such an architecture framework. Andre Pierre Mattei (SCA-ITA) SysML Design of an observation satellite for agriculture surveillance in Brazil FranÃ§ois Fouquet (SnT, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust)Models for managing IoT data Internet of Things applications analyze our past habits through sensor measurements to anticipate future trends. To yield accurate predictions, intelligent systems not only rely on single numerical values, but also on structured models aggregated from different sensors. Computation theory, based on the discretization of observable data into timed events, can easily lead to millions of values. Time series and similar database structures can efficiently index the mere data, but quickly reach computation and storage limits when it comes to structuring and processing IoT data. During this talk, I will present various results presented at Modelsâ15 and SmartGridComâ15 that tackles this complexity by exploiting IoT data characteristics. Notably, I will present a concept of continuous models that can handle high-volatile IoT data by defining a meta type for continuous attributes. In addition to traditional discrete object-oriented modeling APIs, we enable models to represent very large sequences of sensor values by inferring mathematical models that can efficiently replace raw values. We show on various IoT datasets that sequences of polynomials can significantly improve storage and reasoning efficiency. I will present an application of this IoT model extension for suspicious value detection in the SmartGrid domain. We proposed a method to learn and store a profile of âtypicalâ values and their probability in IoT context models. We show that using such profiles together with a contextual checker we can improve suspicious value detection, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

(More information on this project, which involves a number of industrial and research partners from Europe, can be found at: http://certus-sfi.no/u-test-a-horizon-2020-funding-recipient/). Fabien Peureux Fabien Peureux (Femto-st/EGM/Smartesting S&S) Model-Based Testing for Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems Testing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is challenging due to the various uncertainties in their behaviour. The purpose of this talk is to present our ongoing work on a model-based testing framework for automatic generation of executable test cases for CPS in the presence of various uncertainties. Basically, uncertainties can be described as a lack of certainty about the current state or about the future outcome of the system. Within CPS, it can be due to the stimulus and data sent from the user environment to the physical units (application level), to the interactions between the physical units and the network services (infrastructure level), or a combination of the both (integration level). To test such issues, the proposed model-based testing approach is implemented on the EMF framework, and based on the test generation tool Smartesting CertifyIt1. It relies on a UML behavioral model of the system under test, from which abstract test cases are automatically generated by applying dedicated coverage strategies focusing on uncertainty testing.

WSN is a very active and competitive research area due to its diverse and unlimited potential applications: air, underground and underwater. In spite of its young age, economic impact of WSN is important, for examples the industrial control segment market will be worth $5.3B by 2010 and the smart home market will be worth $2.8 billion worldwide by 2012 (Source: Stamatis Karnouskos, EU-US 08 Workshop). WSN is a set of wireless nodes. On one hand, each wireless node (WN) has similar hardware and software functionalities as a PC: CPU, memory, operating system, and communication protocol to fulfill a specific task. On the other hand, a WN has a limited power supply (embedded battery) and consumes approximately 1 million less power (~100Î¼W instead of ~100W) than a PC. Due to resources constraints: energy consumption and form factor, the approaches applied in general purpose computer systems are not adapted to the requirements of WSN. When it comes to the design of energy efficient oriented hardware and software components of WSN, cross-layering optimization approaches are generally adopted such as application-specific unified hardware and software by taking into account the following criteria: trade-off between complexity, efficiency and resource consumption, and application context (context-aware) etc. Currently two main hardware development and design trends are carried out to implement the WN: Commercial OffThe-Shelf âCOTSâ and System on Chip âSoCâ. The first and second generations of WN were designed by using low power 8-bit or 16-bit microcontroller processor core, Bluetooth and non standard wireless access medium (MICA Mote). The current trend of WN design such as Tmotesky, iMote and LiveNode are based on low power 16-bit or 32-bit RISC microcontroller, and full compliance IEEE802.14.5 standard. However the ultimate goal of all the researchers in the world is the implementation of long life, low cost and invisible WN integrated and embedded into environment. Three key technologies make possible to achieve this objective: MEMS âMicroElectroMEchanical systemsâ, UWB âUltra-Wide Bandâ and low power CMOS technology. Different WN prototypes are realized by Intel (iMOTE2), University of Michigan (MOTE: Michigan Uni Prototype) and University of Berkeley (Pico-Mote). WN hardware seems easier to solve than embedded software for diverse WSN applications. The main questions which are related to WSN basic software design is how to keep modularity, high level abstraction and reliability to enable to implement complex massively distributed WSNs to meet resource constraint requirements. Real-time operating system (RTOS) plays a key role to support high level abstraction and distributed collaborative processing. Currently four categories of WSNâs RTOS are developed: Event driven (TinyOS), Multitask (RETOS, tKernel, NutOS, MANTIS), Data-Centric (AmbientRT), and Hybrid (Contiki, LIMOS). Note that TinyOS is very popular but it not adapted to complex hard real-time application. The development challenges of the WSN RTOS are energy-efficiency (context aware, configurable, small footprint), robustness, fault tolerance, support hard real-time constraint, and support component based model (high level of abstraction to ease the integration of high level SW such as protocol, middleware, application, and simulator). Furthermore, for WSN applications, message sending is energy consuming. Thus it is important to implement embedded energy efficient wireless routing protocol to increase WSN lifetime. It is clear that general purpose MANET routing protocol such as AODV (active), OLSR (proactive) and ZBR (hybrid) etc. are not suitable for WSN due to resource constraints. For example optimal routing path is well adapted to general purpose MANET but not suitable for WSN because the repetitive use of the same path will exhaust the battery of WNs belonging to the optimal routing path (black hole). Many WSN dedicated protocols are implemented (spin, cougar, gear, leach, speed ...) but it is currently very difficult to have a clear idea concerning their performance (energy consumption, scalability, connectivity, lifetime ...) because of the lack of large scale WSN real world experimentation results and because the simulation model does not reflect the real-world ones (physical layer). Note that, there is no standard scenario and the application program (with a known number of WNs) enables to evaluate rationally the performance of wireless routing protocols. In addition routing protocol relies on the WSN topology. On one hand, an optimal WSN topology facilitates the implementation of routing and administration protocols. On the other hand, the deployment of large scale WS nodes in a large area is random and its topology is a priori unknown. Then, it is important to investigate the auto-configuration algorithms to increase the efficiency of routing and administration protocols. However the frontier between the administration protocol and the routing protocol is not as clearly defined as in a classical network (e.g. TCP/IP and SNMP) due to cross-layering approach. Moreover WSN security, reliability, and fault tolerance are still an open problem. In this special issue 5 papers are selected among 40 submitted papers for the NTMS workshop on wireless sensor network: theory and practice, held at Tangier at Morocco in 2008, the rest of the papers are selected from an open call for paper. WSN is a multi-disciplinary science. It impossible to present all its topics but this special issue addresses most of the WSN embedded software problems dealing with real-world applications (EU NeT-ADDED FP6 project, French ANR research project and industrial projects).

In such human networks, people come across one another, while their mobile devices exchange and store information in a spontaneous and transparent way. Such an encounter could be established through direct device-todevice connectivity when two devices come into each otherâs communication range, or be enabled by, e.g., a Wi-Fi access point, when the devices both enter its coverage. A new form of dissemination, which we call opportunistic messaging, is such an application that is based on human encounters and mobilities. When human encounters are exploited for communications, the reliance on network infrastructure access is eliminated; communications can be performed even where infrastructure is absent or infrastructure access is intermittent. By leveraging human mobilities, data delivery does not require an end-to-end path from the source to a recipient; instead, people carrying mobile devices serve as relays â they cache othersâ data and forward/deliver the data when appropriate. Thus, the propagation of information is tied to peopleâs physical proximity when they move around, and incorporates the social aspects of communications as people tend to spend more time co-locating with their social relations. Opportunistic messaging is applicable anywhere, and is especially appealing where network infrastructure access is limited or intermittent (e.g., on cruise ships, in national parks, after disasters). Another intriguing characteristic of it is its ease of deployment â no central server is needed, but only a single piece of software on usersâ mobile devices. However, as human encounters and mobilities are unpredictable, when used for social applications, opportunistic messaging is most suited for disseminating user-generated information that is non-formal, less important, and thus not time-critical. In recent years, a considerable amount of efforts have been invested in the research on opportunistic networking and delay-tolerant networking (which encompasses opportunistic networking but is a broader concept). A large portion of prior work has focused on routing issues, e.g., through whom as intermediate carriers to deliver a message to the destinations [1] [2] [3] [4]. The routing issues have been further explored in various contexts, such as in vehicular networks [5] [6] [7] and in social networking applications [8] [9] [10] [11]. However, serious real-world application development, deployment and evaluation of the opportunistic networking concepts still fall behind [12], in which many challenging issues remain to be addressed (to name a few, location-awareness, user incentives and preferences, power preservation, encounter controls, etc.). In this work, we design and prototype PassItOn, a fully distributed opportunistic messaging system. Our goal is to build up a proof-of-concept platform on real mobile devices, and thus show the feasibility and potentials of utilizing human movements for dissemination applications. Meanwhile, we seek to shed lights on the design, implementation and deployment issues in building such systems, and thus stimulate new ideas and perspectives on addressing these issues. Moreover, we aim to offer a real testbed on which new mechanisms, protocols and use cases can be tested and evaluated.",autonomous vehicle,211,not included

Exp.,2005-01-01 00:00:00,semantic_scholar,challenges concerning symbolic computations on grids,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0270dcfa7ca058cea59512b832be6c91408676f,"Challenges concerning symbolic computations on grids Symbolic and algebraic computations are currently ones of fastest growing areas of scientific computing. For a long time, the numerical approach to computational solution of mathematical problems had an advantage of being capable of solving a substantially larger set of problems than the other approach, the symbolic one. Only recently the symbolic approach gained more recognition as a viable tool for solving large-scale problems from physics, engineering or economics, reasoning, robotics or life sciences. Developments in symbolic computing were lagging relative to numerical computing, mainly due to the inadequacy of available computational resources, most importantly computer memory, but also processor power. Continuous growth in the capabilities of computer hardware led naturally to an increasing interest in symbolic calculations and resulted, among others things, in development of sophisticated Computer Algebra Systems (CASs). CASs allow users to study computational problems on the basis of their mathematical formulations and to focus on the problems themselves instead of spending time transforming the problems into forms that are numerically solvable. While their major purpose is to manipulate formulas symbolically, many systems have substantially extended their capabilities, offering nowadays functionalities like graphics allowing a comprehensive approach to problem solving. While, typically, CAS systems are utilized in an interactive mode, in order to solve large problems they can be also used in a batch mode and programmed using languages that are close to common mathematical notation. As CASs become capable of solving large problems, they follow the course of development that has already been taken by numerical software: from sequential computers to parallel machines to distributed computing and finally to the grid. It is particularly the grid that has the highest potential as a discovery accelerator. Currently, its widespread adoption is still impeded by a number of problems, one of which is difficulty of developing and implementing grid-enabled programs. That it is also the case for grid-enabled symbolic computations. There are several classes of symbolic and algebraic algorithms that can perform better in parallel and distributing computing environments. For example for multiprecision integer arithmetic, that appears among others in factorizations, were developed already twenty years ago systolic algorithms and implementations on massive parallel processors, and more recently, on the Internet. Another class that utilize significant amount of computational resources is related to the implementations of polynomial arithmetic: knowledge based algorithms such as symbolic differentiation, factorization of polynomials, greatest common divisor, or, more complicated, Groebner base computations. For example, in the latest case, the size of the computation and the irregular data structures make the parallel or distributed implementation not only an attractive option for improving the algorithm performance, but also a challenge for the computational environment. A third class of algorithms that can benefit from multiple resources in parallel and distributed environments is concerning the exact solvers of large systems of equations. The main reason driving the development of parallel and distributed algorithms for symbolic computations is the ability to solve problems that are memory bound, i.e. that cannot fit into memory of a single computer. An argument for this statement relies on the observation that the input size of a symbolic or algebraic computation can be small, but the memory used in the intermediate stages of the computation may grow considerably. Modern CASs increase their utility not only through new symbolic capabilities, but also expending their applicability using visualization or numerical modules and becoming more than only specific computational kernels. They are real problem solving environments based on interfaces to a significant number of computational engines. In this context it appears also the need to address the ability to reduce the wall-clock time by using parallel or distributed computing environment. A simple example is the case of rendering the images for a simulation animation. Several approaches can be identified in the historical evolution of parallel and distributed CASs: developing versions for shared memory architectures, developing computer algebra hardware, adding facilities for communication and cooperation between existing CASs, or building distributed systems for distributed memory parallel machines or even across Internet. Developing completely new parallel or distributed systems, although efficient, in most cases is rather difficult. Only a few parallel or distributed algorithms within such a system are fully implemented and tested. Still there are several successful special libraries and systems falling in this category: ParSac-2 system, the parallel version of SAC-2, Paclib system, the parallel extension of Saclib, FLATS based on special hardware, STAR/MPI, the parallel version of GAP, ParForm, the parallel version of Form, Cabal, MuPAD, or the recent Givaro, for parallel computing environments, FoxBox or DSC, for distributed computing environments. An alternative approach to build parallel and distributed CASs is to add the new value, the parallelism or the distribution, to an existing system. The number of parallel and distributed versions of most popular CASs is impressive and it can be explained by the different requirements or targeted architectures. For example, for Maple there are several implementations on parallel machines, like the one for Intel Paragon or ||Maple||, and several implementations on networks of workstations, like Distributed Maple or PVMaple. For Mathematica there is a Parallel Computing Toolkit, a Distributed Mathematica and a gridMathematica (for dedicated clusters). Matlab that provides a Symbolic Math Toolbox based on a Maple kernel has more than twenty different parallel or distributed versions: DP-Toolbox, MPITB/PVMTB, MultiMatlab, Matlab Parallelization Toolkit, ParMatlab, PMI, MatlabMPI, MATmarks, Matlab*p, Conlab, Otter and others. More recent web-enabled systems were proved to be efficient in number theory for finding large prime numbers, factoring large numbers, or finding collisions on known encryption algorithms. Online systems for complicated symbolic computations were also built: e.g. OGB for Groebner basis computations. A framework for description and provision of web-based mathematical services was recently designed within the Monet project and a symbolic solver wrapper was build to provide an environment that encapsulates CASs and expose their functionalities through symbolic services (Maple and Axiom were chosen as computing engines). Another platform is MapleNet build on client-server architecture: the server manages concurrent Maple instances launched to server client requests for mathematical computations. WebMathematica is a similar system that offers access to Mathematica applications through a web browser. Grid-oriented projects that involve CASs were only recent initiated. The well-known NetSolve system was one of the earliest grid system developed. Version 2 released in 2003 introduces GridSolve for interoperability with the grid based on agent technologies. APIs are available for Mathematica, Octave and Matlab. The Genss project (Grid Enabled Numerical and Symbolic Services) follows the ideas of the Monet project and intends also to combine grid computing and mathematical web services using a common agent-based framework. Several projects are porting Matlab on grids: from small ones, like Matlab*g, to very complex ones, like Geodise. Maple2g and MathGridLink are two different approaches for grid-enabled version of Maple and Mathematica. Simple to use front-end were recently build in projects like Gemlca and Websolve to deploy legacy code applications as grid services and to allows the submission of computational requests. The vision of grid computing is that of a simple and low cost access to computing resources without artificial barriers of physical location or ownership. Unfortunately, none of the above mentioned grid-enabled CAS is responding simultaneously to some elementary requirements of a possible implementation of this vision: deploy grid symbolic services, access within CAS to available grid services, and couple different grid symbolic services. Moreover a number of major obstacles remain to be addressed. Amongst the most important are mechanisms for adapting to dynamic changes in either computations or systems. This is especially important for symbolic computations, which may be highly irregular in terms of data and general computational demands. Such demands received until now relatively little attention from the research community. In the context of a growing interest in symbolic computations, powerful computer algebra systems are required for complex applications. Freshly started projects shows that porting a CAS to a current distributed environment like a grid is not a trivial task not only from technological point of view but also from algorithmic point of view. Already existing tools are allowing experimental work to be initiated, but a long way is still to be cross until real-world problems will be solved using symbolic computations on grids.

Codd in the 1970s, receives very little attention at DBA gatherings. It's time to remember our roots: we must take a moment to remove one hat, the Physical Database Administrator, and put on another, the Logical Data Modeler, to rejuvenate our understanding of our very purpose. This paper will remind us of the importance of the Logical Data Model, how it fits into this thing called ""Enterprise Architecture"", and offer three secrets to designing a successful model. INTRODUCTION THE PARADOX The people who build Databases are a special breed: they enthusiastically perform a job most people would shun. The very nature of their job is paradoxical: they must at once make easily available the very thing they are charged to supremely protect, nothing less than the most valuable asset of any Information-Age Company, its data. What matters most to people in a functioning Organization is their Business Information: they want it all, they want it perfect and they want it now. They want it protected, pristine, backed-up, jacked-up, quantified and verified. In other words they want it logically accurate, and physically accessible. Paradoxically, all of this responsibility seems to ultimately fall on the shoulders of one individual, the DBA, the âPhysical Database Administrator.â A modern Database, much like a baby, requires a lot of physical attention, dare I say love, to keep it going. That means someone has to be its mother. That âsomeoneâ, of course, is none other than the DBA. Ironically, when all goes well, the DBA is invisible and ignored. When, however, the smallest problem arises, the DBA is vilified and hunted. There are myriad physical reasons why a Database would develop problems, most of which result in highly visible and undesirable consequences. It is no wonder, then, that DBAs concentrate almost exclusively on preventing the highly visible failures. This means they tend to perform the overt mundane duties that prevent the most immediate dangers from disrupting their Database, namely the Physical Tasks. These are the well known, traditional DBA duties that we all know and love, for example, creating and maintaining tablespaces, tables, indexes, triggers, redo log files, partitions, initial parameters, block sizes, users, roles, privileges, packages, procedures, exports, backups, and so on. But these duties represent only half the story. A Database needs more than just physical attention, yet paradoxically, no one ever seems to mention the logical attention it needs. If the DBA is the Databaseâs Mother, providing physical protection and nurturing, then who is the Father, providing logic and purpose? Enter the Data Modeler. LOGICAL VS PHYSICAL, YIN AND YANG, NATURE VS. NURTURE The roles of DBA and Data Modeler are quite different. It takes both roles, Yin and Yang, to rear a Database to healthy adulthood. Then why, do we always seem to hear about the DBA and almost never about the Data Modeler? Far too often the role of Data Modeler is either vastly diminished or unceremoniously handed over to the DBA as a secondary burden. DBA: Design/Configuration Sometimes, heaven forbid, it is abolished altogether. Nothing could be more deleterious to the long-term health of the Database. This phenomenon has analogies to the perennial âNature vs. Nurtureâ debate in science class: how much of a Databaseâs success is due to its genetic design, its âlogical modelâ, as opposed to its developmental manifestation, its âphysical administration?â The answer is, of course, both parents of Database development are needed, the Logical and the Physical, and the unfortunate omission of the Logical Data Modeler from the nursery has had dire consequences indeed. SUMMARY A modern Database needs two types of minds, two distinct skill-sets, two parents, as it were, to conceive it and nurture it to maturity: the Logical parent and the Physical parent. The first parent, the Logical Data Modeler, designs the very potential of the Database, and decides what it will be concerned with, how it defines its own purpose and how it will relate philosophically to the ideal world. The second parent, the DBA, manifests the Database into physical reality, and carefully builds its environment, protects it from malcontents and teaches it how to adapt to the real world. The Data Modelerâs tasks are inherently Logical. The DBAâs tasks are inherently Physical. BEGINNINGS E.F. CODD I often wonder how the above paradox came about. Why do DBAs and not Data Modelers dominate the Database World? And why are Database Professionals mostly concerned with physical performance as opposed to logical truthfulness? And just to make sure weâre all on the same page, just what do we mean by âPhysicalâ vs. âLogical?â in the first place? Fortunately we can shed light on these questions by understanding why we are all here to begin with. The very reason the modern Database Profession exists today is because of a man named E.F. Codd. His breakthrough paper, âThe Relational Model of Data for Large Shares Data Banksâ gave birth to the information age itself. Dr. Coddâs brilliant insight was born out of a physical need to share large amounts of data, yet his solution was inherently a logical masterpiece of the highest order. In other words, he solved a physical problem by applying a logical solution. Thus was spawned the roots of our current paradox: Logical vs. Physical, and hereâs how. Prior to Dr. Coddâs conceptual breakthrough in the 1970âs, electronic data was stored differently depending on its hardware. It was stored in ways that best suited the particular âbig ironâ hardware upon which it resided. Each implementation was rather unique, and to access the data on any particular machine required extensive customization. Consequently, any small change in a âbusiness ruleâ would require an incommensurately large change in the customized coding and data storage structures. Thus, although it was possible to âbrute-forceâ the old systems to behave, one had to accept the relatively high cost of physically reconfiguring the hardware, data structures, and thousands of lines of procedural code. BIRTH OF THE PARADOX In other words, the Data Processing professionals of the 1970s spent most of their time manipulating the physical parts of their systems; a costly and slow way to do business, not to mention self-defeating. Unfortunately, this mindset remains today for many modern DBAs who support the mantra âthou shalt force a database it into submission with more indexes, more code, more hardware.â Though it took several decades to take hold, all this emphasis on physical solutions changed with E.F. Coddâs revolutionary invention, which he named a âRelational Model for Dataâ. For the first time in the history of âData Processingâ, it was possible to trancsend the limitations of hardware and to organize data in such a way to make it accessible without regard to its physical storage; again, truly the heart and soul of the Information Age. DBA: Design/Configuration As we will see later, even Dr. Codd did not fully realize the power of his âRelational Modelâ. His original goals were modest, indeed. He wanted only to propose a new way to store physical data, to make it more efficient for later retrieval. He did this by proposing a novel concept of how to logically organize data according to set-theory. What he did not realize is that he hit upon an extremely powerful idea with far wider implications. Not only was his Relation Model good for organizing electronic data but it was also a perfect method for organizing ALL information, even information about information (e.g. meta-data). THE DATA MODEL WHAT IS A DATA MODEL? In the field of Systems Engineering the discipline of Data Modeling is arguably the least understood. To complicate matters, Analysts (including Zachman) speak of three types of Data Models, namely âConceptualâ, âLogicalâ and âPhysicalâ. What is the difference between these types and how would the master of the Zachman Framework deploy these pieces to win the game? Before we answer this, we must first briefly explore the source of the Data Modelâs power. RELATIONAL THEORY In the early 1970âs, Dr. E.F. Codd, working for IBM, introduced a brilliant solution for organizing information based on mathematical set-theory. His seminal paper, âA Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banksâ (Codd, 1970) remains unequalled today in its impact on information technology. It is heralded for not just spawning the multi-billion dollar Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) industry, which includes Oracle, Sybase, SQLserver, DB2, etc, but also for providing the theoretical foundation for numerous operating systems, the client-server revolution, object oriented databases, data warehousing, not to mention countless user applications, etc (Codd, 1990). Relational Theory is based on three key ideas (Codd, 1970): 1. Elemental Forms. Organize your world by recognizing the things that donât change much. Identify the smallest units of the Enterprise and describe them accurately and uniquely. Model them as they exist in the world; thus as the world changes, so commensurately does the model change. Tech-speak: Identify entities and relationships, and assign finite attributes to them according to set-theory (nTuples). 2. Extensibility. Organize your world into categories of things, to which you can add any number of specific things. Tech-speak: Structure your entities so that they can be iterated to infinity. 3. Independence. Organize your information so that it can be understood on its own merit and in such a way that it is valid and useful irrespective of how it might be used. Tech-speak: Store data independently of how it will be accessed.

The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system.

Existing literature doesn't address all these three requirements simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization algorithm to overcome above mentioned challenges. The proposed solution dynamically selects the scale for quantizing activations and uses Kalman filter to predict quantization scale to reduce accuracy loss.

Based on the results from the test data set, the HMM algorithm performed best for this application. In general, there is little difference between the performance of the HMM and AE algorithms. However, the implementation of the HMM algorithm is more computationally efficient. Because of the large amount of data that must be analyzed in ambulatory ECG recordings, the computational efficiency must be considered as an issue of practicality. Review of the data illuminated some of the strengths and weaknesses of the various algorithms. Variance measures performed with either high sensitivity or high positive predictivity, but were not able to achieve a desirable operating point that had both acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity. Although AE and LPC had acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity, the HMM performed even better than both of these in terms of overall error rate.

Review of recent years of USCG Boating Statistics (2004 thru 2012, subsequent to the beginning of the fuel crisis) yielded several interesting conclusions. Using data 2012 as a benchmark, there were 4,515 recreational boating accidents resulting in 651 fatalities. In 73% of these fatal accidents, the owner/operators had no USCG approved instruction.

The estimations made by recently published data found that lung cancer deaths will increase from 1.6 million in 2012 to 3 million in 2035. This is mainly because most cases are still diagnosed in advanced stages, leading to considerably low survival rates. Therefore, urgent strategies are necessary to facilitate early diagnosis or improve current diagnosis techniques. Due to late detection, only approximately 15% of the patients diagnosed with pulmonary cancer are able to survive for a longer period of time, however, the survival rate increases considerably if the cancer is detected in its early stages.

A risk may be defined as the effects of uncertainty on the achievement of the goals of a company, some of which can be associated with security aspects (e.g., data corruption or data leakage). The execution of the activities can be choreographed using business processes models, in which the risk of the entire business process model derives from a combination of the single activity risks (executed in an isolated manner). In this paper, a risk assessment method is proposed to enable the analysis and evaluation of a set of activities combined in a business process model to ascertain whether the model conforms to the security-risk objectives.

Methods We developed ImmunoGenius, a machine-learning-based expert system for the pathologist, to support the diagnosis of tumors of unknown origin.

designs (e.g., mono, stereo, dual and 360{\deg}camera), and the type, number,
strength, and placement of internal and external magnetic sources that enable
active locomotion. VR-Caps makes it possible to both independently or jointly
develop, optimize, and test medical imaging and analysis software for the
current and next-generation endoscopic capsule systems. To validate this
approach, we train state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accomplish various
medical image analysis tasks using simulated data from VR-Caps and evaluate the

Machine learning (ML), in the form of advanced monitoring and diagnosis technologies, has become increasingly attractive. Implementing ML-based PdM is a difficult and expensive process, especially for those companies which often lack the necessary skills and financial and labour resources. Thus, a cost-oriented analysis is required to define when ML-based PdM is the most suitable maintenance strategy. The implementation of this strategy involves investment costs in IT technologies, in addition to costs incurred from traditional maintenance activities depending of the performance of the ML model classifier; however, no previous research consider both costs in the economic evaluation of PdM.This paper aims to provide a mathematical model where investment costs are included and the ML performance is evaluated in terms of the probability to correctly intercept faults. A error matrix is used to quantify costs due to maintenance actions. Moreover, the mathematical model provides a cost-based quantitative method, based on the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. This optimizes the decision threshold of the ML model classifier, which allows the maintenance costs to be minimized in comparison to traditional decision threshold optimisation methods.

However, this sector requires real collaboration and initiatives from stakeholders to reduce its significant consumption of energy and emission of greenhouse gases. Heat exchangers are examples of equipment in pulp mills that are subjected to undesirable and complex phenomena such as evolution of fouling over time, which leads to inefficiency in terms of energy consumption and unplanned shutdowns, resulting in ineffective maintenance strategies and production costs. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop an accurate predictive maintenance tool that helps mill operators avoid such situations. It is necessary for that tool to effectively track the fouling evolution level and, based on it, deploy a reliable prognostics approach to estimate more accurately the time-to-clean of this equipment. This study presents a new hybrid prognostics approach for fouling prediction in heat exchangers. The proposed approach relies on the fusion of information of different prediction horizons to estimate the time-to-clean. Employing long short-term memory, it allows adaptation of long-term predictions by accurate short-term predictions using multiple non-linear auto-regressive exogenous models. This fusion not only captures the changes in degradation trend over time, but also ensures a good accuracy of prognostics results in both the short- and long-term horizons for planning maintenance actions.

                  Gliomas are uniformly fatal brain tumours with significant neurological and quality of life detriment to patients. Improvement in outcomes has remained largely unchanged in nearly 20 years. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is often used in diagnosis and management. Machine learning analyses of large-scale MRI data are pivotal in advancing the diagnosis, management and improve outcomes in neuro-oncology. A common challenge to robust machine learning approaches is the lack of large âground truthâ datasets in supervised learning for building classification and prediction models. The creation of these datasets relies on human-expert input and is time-consuming and subjective error-prone, limiting effective machine learning applications. Simulation of mechanistic aspects such as geometry, location and physical properties of brain tumours can generate large-scale ground-truth datasets allowing for comparison of analysis techniques in clinical applications. We aimed to develop a transparent and convenient method for building âground truthâ presentations of simulated glioma lesions on anatomical MRI.
               
                  Materials/methods
                  The simulation workflow was created using the Feature Manipulation Engine (FMEÂ®), a data integration platform specializing in the spatial data processing. By compiling and integrating FMEâs functions to read, integrate, transform, validate, save, and display MRI data, and experimenting with ways to manipulate the parameters concerning location, size, shape, and signal intensity with the presentations of glioma, we were able to generate simulated appearances of high-grade gliomas on gadolinium-based high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI (1 mm3). Data of patients with canonical high-grade tumours were used as real-world tumours for validating the accuracy of the simulation. Twenty raters who are experienced with brain tumour interpretation on MRI independently completed a survey, designed to distinguish simulated and real-world brain tumours. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for assessing the performance of the approach with the binary classification of simulated vs real-world tumours. Correlation and regression were used in run time analysis, assessing the software toolsetâs efficiency in producing different numbers of simulated lesions. Differences in the group means were examined using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test.
               
                  Results
                  The simulation method was developed as an interpretable and useful workflow for the easy creation of tumour simulations and incorporation into 3D MRI. A linear increase in the running time and memory usage was observed with an increasing number of generated lesions. The respondents' accuracy rate ranged between 33.3 and 83.3 %. The sensitivity and specificity were low for a human expert to differentiate simulated lesions from real gliomas (0.43 and 0.58) or vice versa (0.65 and 0.62). The mean scores ranking the real-world gliomas did not differ between the simulated and real tumours.

Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much smaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. Different from the popular approach of simultaneously training encoder and decoder using neural network models, the CS theory ensures a high probability of accurate signal reconstruction based on random measurements that is shorter than the length of the original signal under a sparsity constraint. Such method is particularly useful when measurements are expensive, such as wireless sensing of civil structures, because its hardware implementation allows down sampling of signals during the sensing process. Hence, CS methods can achieve significant energy saving for the sensing devices. However, the strong assumption of the signals being highly sparse in an invertible space is relatively hard to guarantee for many real images, such as image of cracks. In this paper, we present a new approach of CS that replaces the sparsity regularization with a generative model that is able to effectively capture a low dimension representation of targeted images. We develop a recovery framework for automatic crack segmentation of compressed crack images based on this new CS method. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method that takes advantage of the strong capability of generative models to capture the necessary features required in the crack segmentation task even the backgrounds of the generated images are not well reconstructed. The superior performance of our recovery framework is illustrated by comparisons to three existing CS algorithms. Furthermore, we show that our framework is potentially extensible to other common problems in automatic crack segmentation, such as defect recovery from motion blurring and occlusion.",health,291,not included

In addition, we propose a conditional reimbursement that will be available based on preliminary data but will require re-evaluation based on consolidated data from clinical trials and/or real-life data. Finally, in order to better carry out these assessments, with a view to access or care, we propose the establishment of partnership agreements with health agencies/hospitals in order to encourage the emergence of field experts, in order to prioritize an ascending expertise closer to patientsâ needs and to real life.",health,300,not included

                  Pediatric guidelines based care is often overlooked because of the constraints of a typical office visit and the sheer number of guidelines that may exist for a patient's visit. In response to this problem, in 2004 we developed a pediatric computer based clinical decision support system using Arden Syntax medical logic modules (MLM).
               
                  Methods
                  The Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation system (CHICA) screens patient families in the waiting room and alerts the physician in the exam room. Here we describe adaptation of Arden Syntax to support production and consumption of patient specific tailored documents for every clinical encounter in CHICA and describe the experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of this system.
               
                  Results
                  As of this writing CHICA has served over 44,000 patients at 7 pediatric clinics in our healthcare system in the last decade and its MLMs have been fired 6182,700 times in âproduceâ and 5334,021 times in âconsumeâ mode. It has run continuously for over 10 years and has been used by 755 physicians, residents, fellows, nurse practitioners, nurses and clinical staff. There are 429 MLMs implemented in CHICA, using the Arden Syntax standard. Studies of CHICA's effectiveness include several published randomized controlled trials.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Our results show that the Arden Syntax standard provided us with an effective way to represent pediatric guidelines for use in routine care. We only required minor modifications to the standard to support our clinical workflow. Additionally, Arden Syntax implementation in CHICA facilitated the study of many pediatric guidelines in real clinical environments.",health,301,not included

This process results in high impact shovel loading operations (HISLO) and exposes operators to severe levels of whole-body vibrations (WBV). The performance of the hydro-pneumatic suspension struts, responsible for vibration attenuation in large dump trucks, decreases as a truck age. There is a need for a system for monitoring and predicting the performance of the suspension struts in real time. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied for modeling and predicting the suspension system performance for light/smaller vehicles. However, no work has been done to implement AI for modeling and predicting the performance of hydro-pneumatic struts in large dump trucks. This paper is a pioneering effort towards developing AI models for solving this problem. These AI models would incorporate the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Mamdani Fuzzy Logic (MFL) and a hybrid system, the Hybrid Neural Fuzzy Interference System (HyFIS), for achieving this goal. Experiments were conducted using a 3D virtual simulator for the CAT 793D in MSC.ADMAS. RMS accelerations in the vertical and horizontal directions at the operator seat were recorded as the two main outputs for the suspension system performance. Eighty percent (80%) of the total experimental data was used in training and developing the models and the remaining 20% for testing and validating the developed models. With an R2 and RMSE of 0.98168505 and 0.00852251 for the training phase, respectively, and 0.9660429 and 0.0195620 for the testing phase, HyFIS model showed the best accuracy for predicting the hydro-pneumatic suspension struts performance for dump trucks. This is the first time that AI models have been developed for dump truck suspension system performance prediction. With the implementation of these models in the dump truck, maintenance personnel can monitor the performance of the suspension system in real-time and schedule proper maintenance and/or replacement. Implementation of such a system will improve the workplace safety, operator's health and the overall system efficiency.",health,302,not included

                  Current implementations for patient similarity analysis require their users to have knowledge of complex data analysis tools. Moreover, data pre-processing and analysis are performed in synthetic conditions: the data are extracted from the EMR database and then the data preparation and analysis are processed in external tools. After all of this effort the users might not experience a superior performance of the patient similarity analysis. We propose methods to optimize the patient similarity analysis in order to make it scalable to big data. Our method was tested against two real datasets and a low execution time was accomplished. Our result hence benefits a comprehensive medical decision support system.

Importantly, these AI technologies are integrated in LDP in a synergistic manner: the diagnosis algorithm is modified to consider the learned fault predictions and the planner is modified to consider the possible diagnoses outputted by the diagnosis algorithm. The overall solution is demonstrated on real faults observed in four open source software projects.",health,304,not included

                  Drug safety researchers seek to know the degree of certainty with which a particular drug is associated with an adverse drug reaction. There are different sources of information used in pharmacovigilance to identify, evaluate, and disseminate medical product safety evidence including spontaneous reports, published peer-reviewed literature, and product labels. Automated data processing and classification using these evidence sources can greatly reduce the manual curation currently required to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls (i.e. drugs that cause adverse drug events and those that do not) to be used in drug safety research.
               
                  Methods
                  In this paper we explore a method for automatically aggregating disparate sources of information together into a single repository, developing a predictive model to classify drug-adverse event relationships, and applying those predictions to a real world problem of identifying negative controls for statistical method calibration.
               
                  Results
                  Our results showed high predictive accuracy for the models combining all available evidence, with an area under the receiver-operator curve of â©¾0.92 when tested on three manually generated lists of drugs and conditions that are known to either have or not have an association with an adverse drug event.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Results from a pilot implementation of the method suggests that it is feasible to develop a scalable alternative to the time-and-resource-intensive, manual curation exercise previously applied to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls to be used in drug safety research.",health,305,not included

                  A programme proposal for competency-based Neurosurgery training adapted to the specialization project is presented. This proposal has been developed by a group of neurosurgeons commissioned by the SENEC (Spanish Society of Neurosurgery) and could be modified to generate a final version that could come into force coinciding with the implementation of the specialization programme. This document aims to facilitate the test of the new programme included in the online version of our journal.
               
                  Duration of the programme
                  Total training period is 6 years; initial 2 years belong to the surgery specialization and remaining 4 years belong to core specialty period.
               
                  Structure of the programme
                  It is a competency-based programmed based on the map used by the US Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) including the following domains of clinical competency: Medical knowledge, patient care, communication skills, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, health systems, interprofessional collaboration and professional and personal development. Subcompetencies map in the domains of Knowledge and Patient care (including surgical competencies) was adapted to the one proposed by AANS and CNS (annex 1 of the programme). A subcompetency map was also used for the specialization rotations.
               
                  Instruction methods

In this investigation, the technique of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) coupled with machine learning algorithms are exploited in designing a computer aided path planning system (CAP) to assist junior doctors in planning surgical paths while sustaining the highest precision. Specifically, after evaluation of approaches of sparse coding and K-means in constructing a codebook, the model of sparse codes of 3D SIFT has been furthered and thereafter employed for retrieving, The novelty of this work lies in the fact that not only the existing algorithms for 2D images have been successfully extended into 3D space, leading to promising results, but also the application of CBIR that is mainly in a research realm, to a clinical sector can be achieved by the integration with machine learning techniques.

This method shows great promise in automating the process of determining circulatory system parameters in the non-invasive clinical diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases. The method employs a Viola-Jones detector that has been specially adapted for efficient detection of transverse sections of the carotid artery. This algorithm is trained on a set of labeled images using the AdaBoost algorithm, Haar-like features and the Matthews coefficient. The training algorithm of the artery detector was modified using evolutionary algorithms. The method for training a cascade of classifiers achieves on a small number of positive and negative training data samples (about 500Â images) a high success rate in a computational time that allows implementation of the detector in real time.

                  In Taiwan, the classification of real problems of children with appropriate occupational therapy is a difficult job for the therapist. The complexities of 127 attribute values to be evaluated in the assessment, the misleading diagnosis which may be made by the pediatrician and the shortage of manpower cause of high workload for the therapist. The design of an easy to use and effective classification model is therefore an important issue in childrenâs occupational therapy treatment. This study accordingly applies an artificial neural network (ANN) and classification and regression tree (CART) techniques to skeleton an intelligent classification model in order to provide a comprehensive framework to assist the therapist to raise the accuracy when categorizing childrenâs problems for occupational therapy. These categories with critical attributes under the guidelines of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) are discussed, in order to assist the therapist for precise assessment and appropriate treatment. To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet been conducted on the problemsâ characteristics in childrenâs occupational therapy.
               
                  Methods
                  Based on the advice and assistance of the therapists and occupational therapy treatment needed, 127 outpatients from a regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2010 were selected as the data sets for problems in children occupation classification. This study accordingly suggests an intelligent model for the classification which integrates ANN and CART. The major steps in applying the model include: (1) building an ANN higher performance trained model; and (2) adopting CART to the trained model and building in previous steps, to extract the critical attributes of children occupational problems.
               
                  Results
                  The results showed that artificial neural network had a higher accuracy, up to 84%, with evenly distributed datasets. Then high performance of the trained neural network had been extracted for the rules by using the classification tree approach in the classification and regression trees application. Most important of all, this study indicated that some of the rules can correctly identify up to 67% of the problems of the children with 100% confidence, which is much better than the current evaluations being used. Moreover, the tree with a binary variable of age and 8 predicators were found and listed afterward, such as, gross coordination, upper left muscle tone, interpersonal skill, proprioceptive and vestibular, visual, visual stimulus input for influence of emotional and movement, swallowing, and dressing. Actual implementation showed that the intelligent classification model is capable of integrating ANN and CART techniques to clarify childrenâs occupational therapy problems with considerable accuracy.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The model could be employed as a supporting system in making decisions regarding children problems with occupational therapy classifications and treatment. The rules extracted from CART were helpful to therapists in classifying what category the real problems of the children belonged to. This study expected that more machine learning techniques will certainly play an essential role in future children occupational therapy applications.",health,312,not included

                        GAMMEU: general asset management model for an electric utility.
                      constitutes an integrated approach that covers the different elements related to the asset management of power transformers in the environment of a utility. GAMMEU harmonizes and inter-relates all the relevant subsystems of the asset management that normally are studied as individual entities and not as a system. Concretely, GAMMEU consists of a platform for data integration, an intelligent system for detection and diagnosis of failures, a failure rate estimation model, a module of reliability analysis and an optimisation model for maintenance scheduling. In this work, a brief description of the elements of GAMMEU is presented and the implementation of the intelligent system for detection and diagnosis as well as the failure rate estimation model is exemplified using data of measurements performed in real power transformers. A robust anomaly detection module using prediction models based on artificial intelligence techniques was developed for top oil temperature monitoring and the use of decision trees as classifiers for the assessment of FRA

                  Information Technologies and Knowledge-based Systems can significantly improve the management of complex distributed health systems, where supporting multidisciplinarity is crucial and communication and synchronization between the different professionals and tasks becomes essential. This work proposes the use of the ontological paradigm to describe the organizational knowledge of such complex healthcare institutions as a basis to support their management. The ontology engineering process is detailed, as well as the way to maintain the ontology updated in front of changes. The paper also analyzes how such an ontology can be exploited in a real healthcare application and the role of the ontology in the customization of the system. The particular case of senior Home Care assistance is addressed, as this is a highly distributed field as well as a strategic goal in an ageing Europe.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  The proposed ontology design is based on a Home Care medical model defined by an European consortium of Home Care professionals, framed in the scope of the K4Care European project (FP6). Due to the complexity of the model and the knowledge gap existing between the â textual â medical model and the strict formalization of an ontology, an ontology engineering methodology (On-To-Knowledge) has been followed.
               
                  Results
                  After applying the On-To-Knowledge steps, the following results were obtained: the feasibility study concluded that the ontological paradigm and the expressiveness of modern ontology languages were enough to describe the required medical knowledge; after the kick-off and refinement stages, a complete and non-ambiguous definition of the Home Care model, including its main components and interrelations, was obtained; the formalization stage expressed HC medical entities in the form of ontological classes, which are interrelated by means of hierarchies, properties and semantically rich class restrictions; the evaluation, carried out by exploiting the ontology into a knowledge-driven e-health application running on a real scenario, showed that the ontology design and its exploitation brought several benefits with regards to flexibility, adaptability and work efficiency from the end-user point of view; for the maintenance stage, two software tools are presented, aimed to address the incorporation and modification of healthcare units and the personalization of ontological profiles.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The paper shows that the ontological paradigm and the expressiveness of modern ontology languages can be exploited not only to represent terminology in a non-ambiguous way, but also to formalize the interrelations and organizational structures involved in a real and distributed healthcare environment. This kind of ontologies facilitates the adaptation in front of changes in the healthcare organization or Care Units, supports the creation of profile-based interaction models in a transparent and seamless way, and increases the reusability and generality of the developed software components. As a conclusion of the exploitation of the developed ontology in a real medical scenario, we can say that an ontology formalizing organizational interrelations is a key component for building effective distributed knowledge-driven e-health systems.",health,314,not included

To that end, we detail a modern one, the LANL reduced gradient bubble model (RGBM), dynamical principles, and correlations with the LANL Data Bank data. Table, profile, and meter fit and risk parameters are obtained in statistical likelihood analysis from decompression exposure data. The RGBM algorithm enjoys extensive and utilitarian application in mixed gas diving, both in recreational and technical sectors, and forms the bases for released tables, software, and decompression meters used by scientific, commercial, and research divers. The LANL Data Bank is described, and the methods used to deduce risk are detailed. Risk functions for dissolved gas and bubbles are summarized. Parameters that can be used to estimate profile risk are tallied. To fit data, a modified LevenbergâMarquardt routine is employed. The LANL Data Bank presently contains 2879 profiles with 20 cases of DCS across nitrox, trimix, and heliox deep and decompression diving. This work establishes needed correlation between global mixed gas diving, specific bubble model, and deep stop data. Our objective is operational diving, not clinical science. The fit of bubble model to deep stop data is chi squared significant to 93%, using the logarithmic likelihood ratio of null set (actual set) to fit set. The RGBM algorithm is thus validated within the LANL Data Bank. Extensive and safe utilization of the model reported in field user statistics for tables, meters, and software also suggests real world validation, that is, one without noted nor reported DCS spikes in the field.",health,315,not included

Completed datasets are preferred for a number of analysis methods, and successful imputation of missing EHR data can improve interpretation and increase our power to predict health outcomes. However, use of the most popular imputation methods mainly require scripting skills, and are implemented using various packages and syntax. Thus, the implementation of a full suite of methods is generally out of reach to all except experienced data scientists. Moreover, imputation is often considered as a separate exercise from exploratory data analysis, but should be considered as art of the data exploration process. We have created a new graphical tool, ImputEHR, that is based on a Python base and allows implementation of a range of simple and sophisticated (e.g., gradient-boosted tree-based and neural network) data imputation approaches. In addition to imputation, the tool enables data exploration for informed decision-making, as well as implementing machine learning prediction tools for response data selected by the user. Although the approach works for any missing data problem, the tool is primarily motivated by problems encountered for EHR and other biomedical data.

A major problem for health authorities is that we do not know. In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative. Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity. As Bluetooth transmission is the most likely method used for such inter-device communication, and as our suggested ""virtual viruses"" do not harm individuals' software or intrude on privacy, we call these Safe Blues. In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals' locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages: - Data about the spread of Safe Blues is uploaded to a central server in real time, which can give authorities a more up-to-date picture in comparison to actual COVID-19 data, which is only available retrospectively. - Sampling of Safe Blues data is not biased by being applied only to people who have shown symptoms or who have come into contact with known positive cases. These features mean that there would be real statistical value in introducing Safe Blues. In the medium term and end game of COVID-19, information from Safe Blues could aid health authorities to make informed decisions with respect to social distancing and other measures. In this paper we outline the general principles of Safe Blues and we illustrate how Safe Blues data together with neural networks may be used to infer characteristics of the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

At the same time, many challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends by making use of continuous crowdsourced labeling of public social media content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow from data collection, filtering, labeling and training of machine learning classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the public health domain.

There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time.

This paper discusses how an ""open science"" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing. CONCLUSIONS:As AI-based data analysis and clinical decision support systems begin to be implemented in healthcare systems around the world, further openness of clinical effectiveness and mechanisms of action may be required by safety-conscious healthcare policy-makers to ensure they are clinically effective in real world use",health,321,not included

Thus, cellular automata (CA) and tetra automata are gaining relevance taking into account the hardware and software solutions.Also it is marked a trend towards an increase in the number of possible states of CA that led to the emergence of new types of CA, which are united in this paper under a common name â postbinary cellular automata.This article proposes a variant of generalized structure of CA cell using asynchronous data storage device, software configurable via the user interface. Several ways of hardware implementation of initial values record in register of the cell status and read the results from the current layer of states in the register of reading the results: serial, block, using a layer of initial states through direct serial or block addressing, or cascade addressing on the basis of tetracodes. It is considered the CTA structure when used as a coprocessor in the local computers. At the same time the detailed descriptions are given, problems are identified, corresponding schematic structure are given. It is considered in detail the generalized block diagram of a multi-layer cellular automaton and it is proposed a generalized block diagram of a multi-layer CA cell that improves performance and extended functionality compared with the known CA.The main advantage of the proposed implementation of cellular automata is functional diversity of elements and flexibility, the ability to change the laws of transitions immediately in all cells (matrix elements). Therefore, CA mass production (as well as CTA) on this technology can get a testing ground for numerous experiments in various fields of science.ÐÑÐµÐ´Ð»Ð¾Ð¶ÐµÐ½ Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð°Ð½Ñ Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð±ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ ÑÑÑÑÐºÑÑÑÑ ÑÑÐµÐ¹ÐºÐ¸ ÐºÐ»ÐµÑÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð°Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð¼Ð°ÑÐ° Ñ Ð¸ÑÐ¿Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ·Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸ÐµÐ¼ Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð½ÑÑÐ¾Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸Ð½Ð°ÑÑÐµÐ³Ð¾ ÑÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¹ÑÑÐ²Ð°, Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¼Ð½Ð¾ Ð½Ð°ÑÑÑÐ°Ð¸Ð²Ð°ÐµÐ¼Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ ÑÐµÑÐµÐ· Ð¿Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ·Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐµÐ»ÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¸Ð½ÑÐµÑÑÐµÐ¹Ñ.

During an image-guided neurosurgery, path planning remains the foremost and hence the most important step to perform an operation and ensures the maximum resection of an intended target and minimum sacrifice of health tissues. In this investigation, the technique of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) coupled with machine learning algorithms are exploited in designing a computer aided path planning system (CAP) to assist junior doctors in planning surgical paths while sustaining the highest precision. Specifically, after evaluation of approaches of sparse coding and K-means in constructing a codebook, the model of sparse codes of 3D SIFT has been furthered and thereafter employed for retrieving, The novelty of this work lies in the fact that not only the existing algorithms for 2D images have been successfully extended into 3D space, leading to promising results, but also the application of CBIR, that is mainly in a research realm, to a clinical sector can be achieved by the integration with machine learning techniques. Comparison with the other four popular existing methods is also conducted, which demonstrates that with the implementation of sparse coding, all methods give better retrieval results than without while constituting the codebook, implying the significant contribution of machine learning techniques",health,328,not included

However, to develop well defined software and hardware based criteria in the application of pattern recognition problems, is possible. The aim of classification can be defined as to assign an unknown object to a class containing similar objects (or to distinguish objects having the same properties from those not possessing). Classification is especially important in the real world applications or in the digital world. Basic classification methods using nearest neighbourhood algorithm have first been seen in early sixties under the subject tile"" pattern recognition."" Classification is used in a huge variety of applications such as automatic target identification, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence, template matching, pattern recognition, analog to digital converters, quantization, medical diagnosis, statistics etc. Therefore nowadays, be it in the real or digital world, data classification is becoming increasingly important. But until recently, major work on classification was on developing algorithms used in software packages whereas, in many applications it is becoming more and more important to classify data much faster and in real time, entailing the need for hardware realization of these algorithms. Software approaches are not practical for real time applications, the processing is computationally very expensive, consuming a lot of Central Processing Unit (CPU) time when implemented as software running on general purpose computers. So in literature hardware implementation of classifier topologies become necessary. Also in literature hardware realized classifiers which are designed to work in low power operation; moreover some of these hardware classifiers do not have custom tunability. So they can only be used for a specific application. The recent developments in electronics technology has created a perfect medium for the hardware realization of classifier structures which, in turn, will render many classifier application prospects feasible in real time. This paper targets the design and application to real world problems of tunable, low power new classifier circuits using CMOS technology. So, a low-power CMOS implementation of a multi-input data classifier with several output levels is presented. The proposed circuit operates in current-mode and can classify several types of analog vector data. An architecture is developed comprising a threshold circuit based on CMOS transistors operating in subthreshold region. To this purpose a one dimensional classifier, called core circuit is proposed. The core circuit also works as a one-dimensional classifier. As this circuit is designed to operate in currentmode the input and the output data is provided to the core circuit with currents. So by interconnecting several core circuits and adding the output currents a multi output classifier can be obtained. Also, combining several core circuits in groups in such a way that each group has identical input current (different from the others), a multi-dimensional, multi-level output classifier can be obtained. Also, numerous efforts in balancing the trade off between power consumption, area and speed have resulted in an acceptable performance. On the other hand, the rapid increasing use of battery operated portable equipment in application areas such as telecommunications and medical electronics increases the importance of low-power and small sized VLSI circuits' technologies. One solution to achieve lowpower and acceptable performance is to operate the transistors in the subthreshold region. The CMOS transistors working in subthreshold region are suitable only for specific applications which need, not very high performance, but low power consumption. The primary aim of this paper is to develop a low power classifier circuit with n inputs and externally tunable decision regions with different output amplitude for each region. Due to the subthreshold operation of the transistors in the proposed core circuit, very low power consumption becomes possible. The proposed core circuit is constructed with two threshold and a subtractor circuit. The SPICE simulation of the threshold circuit, core circuit, one dimensional and two dimensional classifier circuits are given. Using 0.35 Î¼m parameters of AMS CMOS technology, SPICE simulations are performed and a low-power, custom tunable classifier circuit is realized. Because of the parallel processing characteristic of the circuit, it is well suited for real-world applications",health,329,not included

In industry, when software size exceeds certain thresholds, memory errors accumulate and development tools might not be able to cope anymore, resulting in a lengthy program start up times, failing builds, or memory problems at unpredictable times. Thus, foreseeing critical growth in software modules meets a high demand in industrial practice. Predicting the time when the size grows to the level where maintenance is needed prevents unexpected efforts and helps to spot problematic artifacts before they become critical. Although the amount of prediction approaches in literature is vast, it is unclear how well they fit with prerequisites and expectations from practice. In this paper, we perform an industrial case study at an automotive manufacturer to explore applicability and usability of prediction approaches in practice. In a first step, we collect the most relevant prediction approaches from literature, including both, approaches using statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, we elicit expectations towards predictions from practitioners using a survey and stakeholder workshops. At the same time, we measure software size of 48 software artifacts by mining four years of revision history, resulting in 4,547 data points. In the last step, we assess the applicability of state-of-the-art prediction approaches using the collected data by systematically analyzing how well they fulfill the practitioners' expectations.

Active Learning, applied to legal documents, is considered a new technology in the legal domain and is continuously applied to all documents in a legal matter until an insignificant number of relevant documents are left for review.

The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modelling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior.

The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and it has been validated against experimental test data.

While the solution appears simple it raises several issues of incentivizing users to share their bandwidth and also issues of preventing users from cheating behaviors which give them an unfair advantage. In this paper, we propose a system and solution which (i) requires only software downloads on PCs, (ii) is robust to tampering of the software, and intermittent monitoring of an access point by the owner, (iii) a credit based mechanism whereby users earn credits for sharing bandwidth and punishment and pricing mechanism whereby users are charged at a higher price whenever they are caught misbehaving.

Therefore, the approach builds on what is already familiar in the industry, but it takes advantage of computer automation and neural networks for generating and understanding large databases. The appeal of the approach is threefold: it provides increased accuracy in boundary representation, it reduces the labor traditionally required in generating security boundaries, and the resulting boundaries, encoded in fast, flexible C subroutines, can be integrated into energy management system software to provide the operator with compact, understandable boundary illustration in real time.

There is a growing demand in the textile industry to leverage computer vision technology for more efficient quality control in the hope that it will replace the traditional labor-intensive inspection by naked eyes. However, there is an underlying viewpoint in most existing fabric datasets that automatic defect detection is a traditional image classification problem, thus more samples help better, which lacks enough consideration about the problem itself and real application environments. After deep communication with users, we find these facts that an assembly line usually has only a few fixed texture fabrics for a long period, users prefer fast deployment and easily upgradable model to a general model and long-time tuning, and users hope the process of collecting samples, annotating, and deployment affects assembly lines as little as possible. This implies that defect detection is different from popular deep learning problems. Multiple-stage models and fast training become more attractive since users are able to train and deploy models by themselves according to the real conditions of samples that can be obtained. Based on this analysis, we propose a new fabric dataset âZJU-Leaperâ. It provides a series of task settings in accordance with the progressive strategy dealing with the problem, from only normal samples to many defective samples with precise annotations, to facilitate real-world application. To avoid misleading information and inconsistency issues associated with the prior evaluation metrics, we propose a new evaluation protocol by experimental analysis of task-specific indexes, which can tell a truthful comparison between different inspection methods. We also offer some novel solutions to address the new challenges of our dataset, as part of the baseline experiments. It is our hope that ZJU-Leaper can accelerate the research of automated visual inspection and empower the practitioners with more opportunities for manufacturing automation in the textile industry. <p><italic>Impact Statement</italic>âAutomatic defect inspection is very important in quality control of the fabric industry by helping manufacturers to identify production problems early, hence improving product quality and production efficiency. Meanwhile, it is able to reduce the high labor cost of manual inspection and boost the productivity of the textile industry. To develop effective mathematical inspection algorithms, the fabric dataset serves as an indispensable component to present a practical application environment and enable fair evaluation for algorithms. This paper proposes a new dataset, called âZJU-Leaperâ designed from a viewpoint of multiple-stage models and fast training, containing threefold novelty: 1) the data collection and organization consider the actual requirements and special characteristics of assembly lines in textile factories; 2) it has several designed task settings in order to meet the different levels of requirements in the practical inspection task; 3) it provides a reasonable evaluation protocol for comprehensive comparisons between different inspection algorithms. The preliminary experiments show that some existing algorithms still cannot reach the satisfying performance by this benchmark, which implies more effort should be made to develop new methods for the real use of automatic defect inspection.</p>",industry,352,not included

However, in order to achieve good results in a new domain, it is generally demanded to fine-tune a pre-trained deep architecture using new labeled data coming from the target application domain. The fine-tuning procedure is also required when the domain application settings change, e. g., when a camera is moved, or a new camera is installed. This implies the collection and pixel-wise la-beling of images to be used for training, which slows down the deployment of semantic segmentation systems in real industrial scenarios and increases the industrial costs. Taking into account the aforementioned issues, in this paper we propose an approach based on Adversarial Learning to perform scene adaptation for semantic segmentation. We frame scene adaptation as the task of predicting semantic segmentation masks for images belonging to a Target Scene Context given labeled images coming from a Source Scene Context and unlabeled images coming from the Target Scene Context.

Such operations can be carried out by industrial robots in multiple ways because an industrial robot is typically functionally redundant with respect to a finishing task. In the proposed system, a human expert demonstrates a finishing operation, and the demonstrated motion is recorded in the Cartesian space. The robotâs kinematic model is augmented with a virtual mechanism, which is defined according to the applied finishing tool. This way, the kinematic model is expanded with additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to compute the optimal joint space motion of the robot without altering the essential aspects of the Cartesian space task execution as demonstrated by the human expert. Finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, occur in contact with the treated workpiece. Since information about the contact point position is needed to control the robot during the operation, we have developed a novel approach for accurate estimation of contact points using the measured forces and torques. Finally, we applied iterative learning control to refine the demonstrated operations and compensate for inaccurate calibration and different dynamics of the robot and human demonstrator. The proposed method was verified on real robots and real polishing and grinding tasks. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>âThis work was motivated by the need for automation of finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, on contemporary industrial robots. Existing approaches are both too complex and too time-consuming to be applied in flexible and small-scale production, which often requires the frequent deployment of new applications. Our approach is based on programming by demonstration and enables the programming of finishing operations also for users who are not specialists in robot programming. Programming by demonstration is especially useful for teaching finishing operations because it enables the transfer of expert knowledge about finishing skills to robots without providing lengthy task descriptions or manual coding. Besides the human demonstration of the desired operation, the proposed approach also requires the availability of the kinematic model for the machine tool applied to carry out the finishing operation. We provide several practical examples of grinding and polishing tools and how to integrate them into our approach. Another feature of the proposed system is that user demonstrations of finishing operations can be transferred between different combinations of robots and machine tools.",industry,378,included

Fundamentally, realizing such topologies on hardware asserts a strict limit on

every increment in input bit-length. We address this limit by exploring
different methods of implementing sparsity and explore activation quantization.
Further, we develop a library that supports training a neural network with
custom sparsity and quantization. This library also supports conversion of

  using synthetic training data",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10270v1,"In the industrial domain, the pose estimation of multiple texture-less shiny
parts is a valuable but challenging task. In this particular scenario, it is
impractical to utilize keypoints or other texture information because most of
them are not actual features of the target but the reflections of surroundings.
Moreover, the similarity of color also poses a challenge in segmentation. In
this article, we propose to divide the pose estimation process into three
stages: object detection, features detection and pose optimization. A
convolutional neural network was utilized to perform object detection.
Concerning the reliability of surface texture, we leveraged the contour
information for estimating pose. Since conventional contour-based methods are
inapplicable to clustered metal parts due to the difficulties in segmentation,
we use the dense discrete points along the metal part edges as semantic
keypoints for contour detection. Afterward, we exploit both keypoint
information and CAD model to calculate the 6D pose of each object in view. A
typical implementation of deep learning methods not only requires a large
amount of training data, but also relies on intensive human labor for labeling
the datasets. Therefore, we propose an approach to generate datasets and label
them automatically. Despite not using any real-world photos for training, a

For this purpose, a constrained multi-input multi-output (MIMO) non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) based on neural network model is designed to fulfill the control requirements of a Siemens SGT-A65 three-spool aero-derivative gas turbine engine (ADGTE) used for power generation. However, the implementation of NMPC in real time has two challenges: Firstly, the design of an accurate non-linear model, which can run many times faster than real time. Secondly, the usage of a rapid and reliable optimization algorithm to solve the optimization problem in real time. To solve these issues, the constrained MIMO NMPC is created based on the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm as a result of its clarity, ease of use, and capacity to deal with problems in one algorithm. In addition, seven ensembles of eight multi-input single-output (MISO) non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models are used as a base model for the GPC controller to predict the future process outputs. Estimation of free and forced responses of the GPC based on the neural network (NN) model of the plant each sampling time without performing instantaneous linearization is proposed in this study, which reduces the NMPC optimization problem to a linear optimization problem at each sampling step. In addition, the Hildreth's quadratic programming algorithm is used to solve the quadratic optimization problem within the NMPC controller, which offers ease of use and reliability in real time applications. To demonstrate the performance of the NNGPC controller developed in this study, we have compared the performance of the neural network generalized predictive control (NNGPC) controller to the existing controller of the SGT-A65 engine.

However, the volume of data in a hyperspectral image is large (order of Gigabytes) and standard off-the-shelf algorithms for multi-channel image analysis cannot be readily applied, due to the prohibitive computational time and large memory requirements. Therefore, new scalable approaches are required to perform hyperspectral image analysis. In this article we address an efficient methodology for conducting Unsupervised Image Segmentation â one of the basic and most fundamental image analysis operations. In the methodology proposed, unsupervised segmentation is conducted after transforming the spectral and spatial dimensions of the raw hyperspectral image into a more compact representation using multivariate and multiresolution techniques. The clusters identified in the compact image representation are then used to train a discriminative classifier. The classifier is then adapted and transferred for application to the raw image, where it will efficiently label all the original pixels. With the proposed methodology, the computational expensive operations (unsupervised clustering and classifier learning) are minimized, whereas the efficient implementation of the classifier guarantees the analysis at the native resolution.

Retrofitting carbon capture technologies to existing fossil-fuel fired power plants is an important solution to avoid the âlock-inâ of emissions, but the high operating costs hinders their large scale application. The coexistence of renewable power and carbon capture opens up a new avenue that the deployment of carbon capture can provide additional flexibility for better accommodation of renewable power while excess renewables can be used to reduce the operating costs of carbon capture. To this end, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence based optimal scheduling strategy for the power plant-carbon capture system in the context of renewable power penetration to show that the mutual benefits between carbon capture and renewable power can be achieved when the carbon capture process is made fully adjustable. An artificial intelligent deep belief neural network is used to reflect the complex interactions between carbon, heat and electricity within the power plant carbon capture system. Multiple operating goals are considered in the scheduling such as minimizing the operating costs, renewable power curtailment and carbon emission, and the particle swarm heuristic optimization is employed to find the optimal solution. The impacts of carbon capture constraint mode, carbon emission penalty coefficient, carbon dioxide production constraints and renewable power installed capacity are investigated to provide broader insight on the potential benefit of carbon capture in future low-carbon energy system. A case study using real world data of weather condition and load demand shows that renewable power curtailment can be reduced by 51% with the integration of post-combustion capture systems and 35% of total carbon emission are captured by the use of excess renewable power through optimal scheduling.

However, in order to employ passive sampling as a reliable sampling technique, a specific diffusive uptake rate is required for each compound. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was twofold. First, the experimental diffusive uptake rates of the target VOCs were determined under real industrial air conditions using Carbopack X thermal desorption tubes, and active sampling as reference method. The sampling campaigns carried out between October 2017 and May 2018 provided us of experimental diffusive uptake rates between 0.40â¯mLâ¯minâ1 and 0.70â¯mLâ¯minâ1 and stable over time (RSD %â¯<â¯8%) for up to 41 VOCs. Secondly, the uptake rates obtained experimentally were applied for the determination of VOCs concentrations at 16 sampling sites in the North Industrial Complex of Tarragona.

These collaborative model resources could significantly improve the transfer of knowledge from research into commercial and governmental applications and also increase efficiency, transparency and usability of predictive models. To demonstrate the feasibility, predictive models of Salmonella in beef previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models were made publicly available in a Food Safety Model Repository within the OpenML for Predictive Modelling in Food community project. Three different approaches were used to create new models in the model repositories: (1) all information relevant for model re-implementation is available in a scientific publication, (2) model parameters can be imported from tabular parameter collections and (3) models have to be generated from experimental data or primary model parameters. All three approaches were demonstrated in the paper.

Unfortunately, to be implemented, this kind of testing method often incurs very high costs (expensive instruments, long test timeâ¦). A common approach, in the literature, is the so-called indirect/alternate test strategy. This strategy consists in deriving targeted specifications from low-cost Indirect Measurements (IMs). During the industrial test phase, the estimation of regular specifications using IMs is based on a correlation model that has been built previously, during a training phase. Despite the substantial test cost reduction offered by this strategy, its deployment in industry is limited, mainly because of a lack of confidence in the accuracy of estimations made by the correlation model. A solution to increase the confidence in the estimation of specifications using the indirect approach is to implement redundancy in the prediction phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that the redundancy implementation brings more than identifying rare misjudged circuits from a high-correlated model. Indeed redundancy massively increases the accuracy despite of the lack of accurate models that have been assumed in previous implementations of redundant indirect testing. This approach is illustrated on a real case study for which we have experimental measurements on a set of 10,000 devices.",industry,418,not included

Results Growth factor concentrations in single-donor SRGF were characterized by high variability (mean (pg/ml)âCV); VEGF: 950â81.4; FGF-b: 27â74.6; PDGF-AA: 7883â28.8; PDGF-AB: 107834â32.5; PDGF-BB: 11142â48.4; Endostatin: 305034â16.2; Angiostatin: 197284â32.9; TGF-Î²1: 68382â53.7; IGF-I: 70876â38.3; EGF: 2411â30.2). In silico performed analysis suggested that pooling nÂ =Â 16 single-donor SRGF reduced CV below 20%. Concentrations measured in 10 pools of nÂ =Â 16 single SRGF were not different from mean values measured in single SRGF, but the CV was reduced to or below the threshold. Separate SRGF pools failed to differently affect ASC growth rate (slope pool AÂ =Â 0.6; R2Â =Â 0.99; slope pool BÂ =Â 0.7; R2 0.99) or differentiation potential. Discussion Results deriving from our algorithm and from validation utilizing real SRGF pools demonstrated that pooling nÂ =Â 16 single-donor SRGF products can ameliorate variability of final growth factor concentrations. Different pools of nÂ =Â 16 single donor SRGF displayed consitent capability to modulate growth and differentiation potential of expanded ASC.

They are engaged in artificial intelligence means, knowledge mining in huge flows of big data, robotization, and in the internet of things. Smart contracts also can be mentioned here, although the âintelligenceâ of smart contracts still needs to be seriously elaborated. These trends should inevitably lead to an increased role of logical methods working with semantics, and significantly expand the scope of their application in practice. However, there are a number of problems that hinder this process.

We are developing an approach, which makes the application of logical modeling efficient in some important areas. The approach is based on the concept of locally simple models and is primarily focused on solving tasks in the management of enterprises, organizations, governing bodies. The most important feature of locally simple models is their ability to replace software systems. Replacement of programming by modeling gives huge advantages, for instance, it dramatically reduces development and support costs. Modeling, unlike programming, preserves the explicit semantics of models allowing integration with artificial intelligence and robots. In addition, models are much more understandable to general people than programs.

In this paper we propose the implementation of the concept of locally simple modeling on the basis of so-called document models, which has been developed by us earlier. It is shown that locally simple modeling is realized through document models with finite submodel coverages. In the second part of the paper an example of using document models for solving a management problem of real complexity is demonstrated",industry,430,not included

Some of them are employed even for diagnosis. With the variability of transcatheter prostheses, the most appropriate choice can be complex. This scenario reveals an enabling environment for the use of an Expert system. The goal of the study was to develop an Expert system based on artificial intelligence for supporting the transcatheter aortic prosthesis selection.  Methods: The system was developed on Expert SINTA. The rules were created according to anatomical parameters indicated by the manufacturing company. Annular aortic diameter, aortic area, aortic perimeter, ascending aorta diameter and Valsalva sinus diameter were considered. After performing system accuracy tests, it was applied in a retrospective cohort of 22 patients with submitted to the CoreValve prosthesis implantation. Then, the system indications were compared to the real heart team decisions.  Results: For 10 (45.4%) of the 22 patients there was no concordance between the Expert system and the heart team. In all cases with discordance, the software was right in the indication. Then, the patients were stratified in two groups (same indication vs. divergent indication). The baseline characteristics did not show any significant difference. Mortality, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, aortic regurgitation and prosthesis leak did not present differences. Therefore, the maximum aortic gradient in the post-procedure period was higher in the Divergent Indication group (23.9 mmHg vs. 11.9 mmHg, P=0.03), and the mean aortic gradient showed a similar trend.  Conclusion: The utilization of the Expert system was accurate, showing good potential in the support of medical decision. Patients with divergent indication presented high post-procedure aortic gradients and, even without clinical repercussion, these parameters, when elevated, can lead to early prosthesis dysfunction and the necessity of reoperation",industry,431,not included

Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively.

Under this framework, researchers can improve the ray-tracing tools with more essential elements of urban environment.

UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating in real time on a reasonably modern workstation.

The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener.

This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios. This is shown through significant improvements in the cumulative regret as well as the instantaneous delay, compared to the case where all newly-appeared FNs are explored.",smart cities,450,not included

repackaging a bonafide benign mobile app to contain malware in addition to the

  approach to seat inventory control and overbooking",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06824v2,"Revenue management can enable airline corporations to maximize the revenue
generated from each scheduled flight departing in their transportation network
by means of finding the optimal policies for differential pricing, seat
inventory control and overbooking. As different demand segments in the market
have different Willingness-To-Pay (WTP), airlines use differential pricing,
booking restrictions, and service amenities to determine different fare classes
or products targeted at each of these demand segments. Because seats are
limited for each flight, airlines also need to allocate seats for each of these
fare classes to prevent lower fare class passengers from displacing higher fare
class ones and set overbooking limits in anticipation of cancellations and
no-shows such that revenue is maximized. Previous work addresses these problems
using optimization techniques or classical Reinforcement Learning methods. This
paper focuses on the latter problem - the seat inventory control problem -
casting it as a Markov Decision Process to be able to find the optimal policy.
Multiple fare classes, concurrent continuous arrival of passengers of different
fare classes, overbooking and random cancellations that are independent of
class have been considered in the model. We have addressed this problem using
Deep Q-Learning with the goal of maximizing the reward for each flight
departure. The implementation of this technique allows us to employ large
continuous state space but also presents the potential opportunity to test on
real time airline data. To generate data and train the agent, a basic
air-travel market simulator was developed. The performance of the agent in
different simulated market scenarios was compared against theoretically optimal

crowdsourcing phase. In the task allocation phase, we propose a Stackelberg
game based mechanism for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to efficiently
allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data
crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real
working location to improve its utility, which causes adverse effects to the
spatial crowdsourcing platform. To address this issue, we present three
strategyproof deployment mechanisms for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to
place a mobile base station, e.g., vehicle or robot, which is responsible for
transferring the wireless power and collecting the crowdsourced data. As the
benchmark, we first apply the classical median mechanism and evaluate its
worst-case performance. Then, we design a conventional strategyproof deployment
mechanism to improve the expected utility of the spatial crowdsourcing platform
under the condition that the workers' locations follow a known geographical
distribution. For a more general case with only the historical location data
available, we propose a deep learning based strategyproof deployment mechanism

So current methods are based on reduced complexity models or flight envelopes are determined locally. This paper presents a novel method to estimate the global flight envelope of impaired aircraft in real-time for any unknown failure degree.

Then multiple feedforward neural networks are trained offline by a Bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm. Finally, the trained networks are used to estimate flight envelopes in real time.

In order to minimize the total cost, this study simultaneously considers semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing, and establishes a linear mathematical model capable of interpreting real world practices under single or multiple alliances scenarios. An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm are reasonably combined into a hybrid meta-heuristics to solve the cooperative 2E-LDPN optimization problem. This algorithm combines the merits of IPSO and ACO with local and global search capabilities, and redistributes customer zones on the basis of region partitioning solutions in order to rationalize transportation activities.

The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland.
                  In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization.

That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income.

The results obtained from the local learning model were comparable or better than results obtained from physically-based, i.e. Kinematic Wave Model (KWM), Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), and Hydrologiska ByrÃ¥ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model. The local learning algorithm also required a shorter training time compared to a global learning NFS model. The local learning model was next tested in real-time mode, where the model was continuously adapted when presented with current information in real time. The real-time implementation of the local learning model gave better results, without the need for retraining, when compared to a batch NFS model, where it was found that the batch model had to be retrained periodically in order to achieve similar results.",smart cities,511,not included

Traditionally, the utility functions defined on such networks are optimized using some variation of Linear Programming, such as Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). Despite enormous progress both in hardware (multiprocessor systems and specialized processors) and software (Gurobi) we are reaching the limits of what these tools can handle in real time. Modern logistic problems, for example, call for expanding the problem both vertically (from one day up to several days) and horizontally (combining separate solution stages into an integrated model). The complexity of such integrated models calls for alternative methods of solution, such as Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), which provide a further increase in the performance necessary for the daily operation. In this paper, we present the theoretical basis and related experiments for solving the multistage decision problems based on the results obtained for shorter periods, as building blocks for the models and the solution, via Critic-Model-Action cycles, where various types of neural networks are combined with traditional MIP models in a unified optimization system. In this system architecture, fast and simple feed-forward networks are trained to reasonably initialize more complicated recurrent networks, which serve as approximators of the value function (Critic). The combination of interrelated neural networks and optimization modules allows for multiple queries for the same system, providing flexibility and optimizing performance for large-scale real-life problems. A MATLAB implementation of our solution procedure for a realistic set of data and constraints shows promising results, compared to the iterative MIP approach.",smart cities,512,not included

In problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. However, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. The present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. The method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. Each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. While the initial control area is radial, its shape is adaptively improved using a Hermite interpolation procedure. The modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. As optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. The modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the Greek island of Santorini. The numerical code SEAWAT was selected for solving the partial differential equations of flow and density dependent transport. The decision variables correspond to pumping rates from 34 wells. The modular subnetwork implementation resulted in significant reduction in CPU time and identified an even better solution than the original numerical model.",smart cities,513,included

                  Neural networks can risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with potential acute coronary syndromes with a high specificity, potentially facilitating ED discharge of patients to home. We hypothesized that the use of âreal-timeâ neural networks would decrease the admission rate for ED chest pain patients.
               
                  Methods
                  We conducted a before-and-after trial. Consecutive ED patients with chest pain were evaluated before and after implementation of a neural network in an urban university ED. Data included 40 variables used in neural networks for acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Data were obtained in real time, and neural network outputs were provided to the treating physician while patients were in the ED. On hospital discharge, attending physicians received feedback, including neural network output, their initial clinical impression, cardiac test results, and final diagnosis. The main outcome was the actual admit/discharge decision made before versus after the implementation of the neural network.
               
                  Results
                  Before implementation, 4,492 patients were enrolled; after implementation, 432 patients were enrolled. Implementation of the neural network did not decrease the hospital admission rate (before: 62.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 61.3% to 64.1%] versus after: 66.6% [95% CI 62.2% to 71.0%]). Additionally, the ICU admission rates were not different (11.4% [95% CI 10.5% to 12.3%] versus 9.3% [95% CI 6.6% to 12.0%]). Physician query found that the neural network changed management in only 2 cases (<1%).
               
                  Conclusion
                  The use of real-time neural network feedback did not influence the admission decision for ED patients with chest pain, most likely because the neural network output was delayed until the return of cardiac markers, and the disposition decision had already been made by that time.",smart cities,515,not included

In 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, many predicted that sealed gates would soon become relics of a bygone era. Today, we find a different reality. Instead of disappearing, borders are transforming. In this article, we build upon the shifting border logic to explore how responses to the global pandemic have accelerated processes of detachment of mobility control from a fixed territorial marker. From global travel bans to mandating prearrival proof of a negative test result taken within 48 or 72 hours prior to departure to requiring digital registration of a passenger's travel history to enforcing strict post-arrival mandatory quarantine orders that arrest mobility, the shifting border paradigm has provided a template for policymakers to respond to a mounting global crisis. In addition to regulating movement across international borders and within countries, we trace the surprising return of subnational and interregional division lines in managing mobility, the erosion of the once taken for granted right to return to oneâs home country, and the spatial and legal techniques used to block refugees from reaching terra firma during the pandemic. Next, we critically evaluate the authorization given under emergency regulations to deploy novel biometric and AI technologies, big data, and predictive algorithms to surveil moving bodies at real time and reprimand those deemed to have breached their quarantine or related governmental emergency measures. While drastic times call for drastic measures, techniques of movement control that ""scan"" and trace our bodies raise serious questions about justice, fairness, and the risk of discrimination, which may well remain with us even long after the pandemic is over",smart cities,516,not included

The evolution of the structure of convolutional neural networks used in the field of computer video flow diagnostics is analyzed. The performance of video flow diagnostics algorithms and car license plate recognition has been evaluated. The technique of recognizing the license plates of cars in the video stream of transport neural networks is described. The study focuses on the creation of a combined system that combines artificial intelligence and computer vision based on fuzzy logic. To solve the problem of license plate image recognition in the video stream of the transport system, a method of image recognition in a continuous video stream with its implementation based on the composition of traditional image processing methods and neural networks with convolutional and periodic layers is proposed. The structure and peculiarities of functioning of the intelligent distributed system of urban transport safety, which feature is the use of mobile devices connected to a single network, are described.
A practical implementation of a software application for recognizing car license plates by mobile devices on the Android operating system platform has been proposed and implemented. Various real-time vehicle license plate recognition scenarios have been developed and stored in a database for further analysis and use. The proposed application uses two different specialized neural networks: one for detecting objects in the video stream, the other for recognizing text from the selected image. Testing and analysis of software applications on the Android operating system platform for license plate recognition in real time confirmed the functionality of the proposed mathematical software and can be used to securely analyze the license plates of cars in the scanned video stream by comparing with license plates in the existing database. The authors have implemented the operation of the method of convolutional neural networks detection and recognition of license plates, personnel and critical situations in the video stream from cameras of mobile devices in real time. The possibility of its application in the field of safe identification of car license plates has been demonstrated.Ð¡ÑÐ°ÑÑÑ Ð¿ÑÐ¸ÑÐ²ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð°Ð½Ð°Ð»ÑÐ·Ñ Ð¼ÐµÑÐ¾Ð´ÑÐ² ÑÐ¾Ð·Ð¿ÑÐ·Ð½Ð°Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð½Ñ Ð·Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ñ ÑÐ° Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÐºÑ ÑÑ Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´ÐµÐ¾Ð¿Ð¾ÑÐ¾ÑÑ.

My doctoral dissertation focuses on the problem of improving coverage and reducing transmission latency and losses in wireless local area networks (WLANs). The solutions in my dissertation improve the performance and quality of a variety of delaysensitive wireless applications that do not run well on todayâs WLANsâthese applications include voice over IP, video conferencing, and online gaming. During my career as a graduate student at MIT, I have also worked on several systems projects related to managing mobility in wireless networks, characterizing the performance of the Cricket location system, implementing a programming library for location-aware applications, developing a personal indoor navigation system, and building a system that extends high bandwidth Internet connectivity to moving vehicles in a city via open 802.11 access points. In the future, I would like to continue to explore problems in wireless networks and mobile systems, and develop new applications for these systems. One of the big challenges in designing effective wireless networks and mobile systems is that their performance is often affected by the limitations of device hardware and by the vulgarities of the physical environment. For example, location sensors and wireless networking interfaces may work perfectly in a large open field. But harmful effects such as attenuation, interference, reflections, and mobility that are commonly found in real operational settings can lead to incorrect position estimates and unsuccessful packet transmissions. Because the complexity of the physical environment are intractable, the simple analytical and simulation models used to design and study these systems can often lead to unexpected and undesirable results in practice. My early experience in working with the Cricket location system led me to realize that running experiments using testbeds and building system prototypes are necessary to develop robust wireless networks and mobile systems that work effectively in the real world, and to conduct system evaluations that are representative and meaningful. For example, by building the Cricket indoor navigation system and studying it in a real environment, we found numerous problems such as inaccuracies, fragile components, and the lack of debugging facility in the original Cricket devices that eventually led to a series of recommendations in the design of the much-improved Cricket v2 system. By analyzing the data collected in our testbed, we gained new insights that led to an improved position estimation algorithm with reduced delay and improved accuracy. Building on my successful experience in Cricket, my doctoral thesis work also follows the approach of hands-on system-building and experimentation. In my dissertation, I explore the problem of increasing loss resilience and reducing transmission delay in wireless local area networks. By conducting a wide range of experiments, I discovered that transmission losses in WLANs, while often bursty, are also independent between different transmission paths, particularly when nodes are moving. These results motivated me to revisit some of the traditional approaches used to combat transmission losses in current WLAN systems and to seek creative yet practical ways to improve them. To obtain good coverage inside a building, WLAN operators typically deploy multiple access points (APs), which are network elements that relay packets for a WLAN client. In todayâs WLAN, each AP operates independently and limits each WLAN client to communicate with a single AP. Thus, when the channel quality of the transmission path deteriorates, the transmitter must either repeat retransmissions until the channel quality improves or reduce the transmission rate to compensate for the poor channel. The consequence is manifested as transmission loss (which occurs when the transmitter exhausts the retransmission limit) or transmission delay, which can drastically reduce the perceived quality of many wireless applications. My thesis attempts to tackle the problem from a systemsâ perspective. I hypothesized that APs with",smart cities,519,not included

Identifying emerging applications based on well-known port numbers is no longer reliable. While deep packet inspection (DPI) solutions can be accurate, they require constant updates of signatures and become infeasible for encrypted payload especially in multimedia applications (e.g. Skype). Statistical approaches based on machine learning have thus been considered more promising and robust to encryption, privacy, protocol obfuscation, etc. However, the computation complexity of traffic classification using those statistical solutions is high, which prevents them being deployed in systems that need to manage Internet traffic in real time. This paper proposes a FPGA-based parallel architecture to accelerate the statistical identification of multimedia applications while maintaining high classification accuracy. Specifically, we base our design on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm which has been shown to be one of the most accurate machine learning algorithms for Internet traffic classification. To enable high-rate data streaming for real-time classification, we adopt the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for approximate k-NN. The LSH scheme is carefully designed to achieve high accuracy while being efficient for implementation on FPGA. Processing components in the architecture are optimized to realize high throughput.

Such an estimate is required by most 3-D to 2-D registration and tracking methods that can efficiently refine an initial value by numerical optimization to precisely recover 3-D pose. However the analytic computation of an initial pose guess requires the solution of an extremely complex correspondence problem that is due to the large number of topologically distinct aspects that arise when a three dimensional opaque object is imaged by a camera. Hence general analytic methods fail to achieve real-time performance and most tracking and registration systems are initialized interactively or by ad hoc heuristics. To overcome these limitations we present a novel method for approximate object pose estimation that is based on a neural net and that can easily be implemented in real-time. A modification of Kohonen's self-organizing feature map is systematically trained with computer generated object views such that it responds to a preprocessed image with one or more sets of object orientation parameters. The key idea proposed here is to choose network topology in accordance with the representation of 3-D orientation. Experimental results from both simulated and real images demonstrate that a pose estimate within the accuracy requirements can be found in more than 81% of all cases.

This is a problem of generic interest to researchers in the computer graphics, computer vision, artificial intelligence and robotics community where it plays an important role in applications such as object recognition, mapping, navigation and conversion from point clouds representations to 3D surface models. Prior work on the subject is either computationally burdensome, precluding real time applications such as robotic navigation and mapping, prone to error for noisy measurements commonly found at long range or requires availability of coregistered color imagery. The approach we describe consists of 3 steps: (1) detect a set of candidate planar surfaces, (2) cluster the planar surfaces merging redundant plane models, and (3) segment the point clouds by imposing a Markov Random Field (MRF) on the data and planar models and computing the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) of the segmentation labels using Bayesian Belief Propagation (BBP). In contrast to prior work which relies on color information for geometric segmentation, our implementation performs detection, clustering and estimation using only geometric data. Novelty is found in the fast clustering technique and new MRF clique potentials that are heretofore unexplored in the literature. The clustering procedure removes redundant detections of planes in the scene prior to segmentation using BBP optimization of the MRF to improve performance. The MRF clique potentials dynamically change to encourage distinct labels across depth discontinuities. These modifications provide improved segmentations for geometry-only depth images while simultaneously controlling the computational cost. Algorithm parameters are tunable to enable researchers to strike a compromise between segmentation detail and computational performance. Experimental results apply the algorithm to depth images from the NYU depth dataset which indicate that the algorithm can accurately extract large planar surfaces from depth sensor data.",multimedia,528,not included

Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities such as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity operations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an effective system for model development that streamlines data curation, training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges. The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a cloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset, to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses (positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code. Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality. Remote development, scalable compute, and automatic organization of data and artifacts have dramatically decreased iteration time while increasing reproducibility and system comprehension.

Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot.

Meanwhile, to clarify our achievements following scientific method, we have to establish our evaluation function FMI to give a score to tell what level of goodness our implementation could achieve. The first task is implementation of different region growing algorithms. We implement a general split and merge algorithm and the Blob Coloring algorithm that can work both in 2D and in 3D with different homogeneity criteria. For the split and merge algorithm, we will use quad-tree algorithm to split and merge our image based on the homogeneity. For the blob algorithm, we will check the L shape, then merge the pixels with similar homogeneity, and ignore those not.

Besides, the frequently requested popular videos are transmitted for multiple times and contribute to most of the bandwidth consumption, which causes massive transmission redundancy. Therefore, we propose a Learning-based Edge with cAching and Prefetching (LEAP) to improve the online user QoE of adaptive video streaming. LEAP introduces caching into the edge to reduce the redundant video transmission and employs prefetching to fight against network jitters. Taking the state information of users into account, LEAP intelligently makes the most beneficial decisions of caching and prefetching by a QoE-oriented deep neural network model. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we deploy the implemented prototype of LEAP in both the simulated scenario and the real Internet.

The initial video segment (IVS) of live streaming plays an important role in the QoE of live viewers, particularly when users require fast join time and smooth view experience.

Rldish is transparent to both the client and the streaming server.

It is found that simple and straightforward algorithms tend to have high potential for real time but produce event distributions that differ considerably from those obtained in AER VLSI chips. On the other hand, sophisticated algorithms that yield better event distributions are not efficient for real time operations.

The reasons for changing the input data can be the actions of geometric transformations, the influence of background or interference. The elements of false objects with similar characteristics are formed. The problem of ensuring high-quality recognition requires the implementation of effective means of image processing. Methods of statistical modeling, granulation of data and fuzzy sets, detection and comparison of keypoints on the image, classification and clustering of data, and simulation modelling are used in this research.

benefit from optimized 1D convolution layers. In this work, we introduce our
efficient implementation of a generic 1D convolution layer covering a wide
range of parameters. It is optimized for x86 CPU architectures, in particular,
for architectures containing Intel AVX-512 and AVX-512 BFloat16 instructions.
We use the LIBXSMM library's batch-reduce General Matrix Multiplication
(BRGEMM) kernel for FP32 and BFloat16 precision. We demonstrate that our
implementation can achieve up to 80% efficiency on Intel Xeon Cascade Lake and
Cooper Lake CPUs. Additionally, we show the generalization capability of our
BRGEMM based approach by achieving high efficiency across a range of
parameters. We consistently achieve higher efficiency than the 1D convolution
layer with Intel oneDNN library backend for varying input tensor widths, filter
widths, number of channels, filters, and dilation parameters. Finally, we
demonstrate the performance of our optimized 1D convolution layer by utilizing
it in the end-to-end neural network training with real genomics datasets and
achieve up to 6.86x speedup over the oneDNN library-based implementation on
Cascade Lake CPUs. We also demonstrate the scaling with 16 sockets of
Cascade/Cooper Lake CPUs and achieve significant speedup over eight V100 GPUs
using a similar power envelop. In the end-to-end training, we get a speedup of
1.41x on Cascade Lake with FP32, 1.57x on Cooper Lake with FP32, and 2.27x on
Cooper Lake with BFloat16 over eight V100 GPUs with FP32.",multimedia,605,not included

The difference between the completed skull and the partial skull is the restored defect; in other words, the implant that can be used in cranioplasty. To fulfill the task of volumetric shape completion, a fully data-driven approach is proposed. Supervised skull shape learning is performed on a database containing 167 high-resolution healthy skulls. In these skulls, synthetic defects are injected to create training and evaluation data pairs. We propose a patch-based training scheme tailored for dealing with high-resolution and spatially sparse data, which overcomes the disadvantages of conventional patch-based training methods in high-resolution volumetric shape completion tasks. In particular, the conventional patch-based training is applied to images of high resolution and proves to be effective in tasks such as segmentation.

It utilizes a weighted finite-state transducer as a decoder, which smooths the output from a language classifier fed by multilingual and augmented bottleneck features. An essential factor from the accuracy point of view is that these features, as well as the classifier itself, are based on deep neural network architectures that allow the modeling of long-term time dependencies.

While this usage of the cameras is important for a post crime action, there exists the need for real time monitoring to act as an early warning to prevent or avoid an incident before it occurs. In this paper, we describe the development and implementation of an early warning system that recognizes people automatically in a surveillance camera environment and then use data from various sources to identify these people and build their profile and network. The current literature is still missing a complete workflow from identifying people/criminals from a video surveillance to building a criminal information extraction framework and identifying those people and their interactions with others We train a feature extraction model for face recognition using convolutional neural networks to get a good recognition rate on the Chokepoint dataset collected using surveillance cameras. The system also provides the function to record people appearance in a location, such that unknown people passing through a scene excessive number of times (above a threshold decided by a security expert) will then be further analyzed to collect information about them. We implemented a queue based system to record people entrance. We try to avoid missing relevant individuals passing through as in some cases it is not possible to add every passing person to the queue which is maintained using some cache handling techniques. We collect and analyze information about unknown people by comparing their images from the cameras to a list of social media profiles collected from Facebook and intelligent services archives. After locating the profile of a person, traditional news and other social media platforms are crawled to collect and analyze more information about the identified person. The analyzed information is then presented to the analyst where a list of keywords and verb phrases are shown. We also construct the personâs network from individuals mentioned with him/her in the text. Further analysis will allow security experts to mark this person as a suspect or safe. This work shows that building a complete early warning system is feasible to tackle and identify criminals so that authorities can take the required actions on the spot.",multimedia,626,not included

In large-scale construction projects, the process of monitoring the implementation of every single part of buildings and reflecting them on the BIM models can become highly labour intensive and error-prone, due to the vast amount of data produced in the form of schedules, reports and photo logs. In order to address the mentioned methodological and technical gap, this paper presents a framework and a proof of concept prototype for on-demand automated simulation of construction projects, integrating some cutting edge IT solutions, namely image processing, machine learning, BIM and Virtual Reality. This study utilised the Unity game engine to integrate data from the original BIM models and the as-built images, which were processed via various computer vision techniques. These methods include object recognition and semantic segmentation for identifying different structural elements through supervised training in order to superimpose the real world images on the as-planned model. The proposed framework leads to an automated update of the 3D virtual environment with states of the construction site. This framework empowers project managers and stockholders with an advanced decision-making tool, highlighting the inconsistencies in an effective manner. This paper contributes to body knowledge by providing a technical exemplar for the integration of ML and image processing approaches with immersive and interactive BIM interfaces, the algorithms and program codes of which can help replicability of these approaches by other scholars.",multimedia,627,not included

The task of the research is the development of simulation models of the semantics of the event localization space based on multi-agent neurocognitive architectures. The paper proves that the multi-agent neurocognitive architecture is an effective formalism for describing the semantics of the spatial localization of events. Main theoretical foundations have been developed for the simulation of spatial relations using the so-called multi-agent facts, consisting of software agents-concepts, reflecting semantic categories corresponding to parts of speech. It is shown that locative software agents that describe the spatial location of objects and events, forming homogeneous connections, compose the so-called field locations. The latter describes a holistic view of the intellectual agent about the environment. The paper defines conceptual foundations of multi-agent modeling of the semantics of subjective reflexive mapping of the interaction between real objects, space and time.",multimedia,628,not included

In this context, we propose a hybrid approach relying on a novel birdâs accent-based many objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (named acMaPSO) to resolve the problem of 3D indoor deployment on the Internet of Things collection networks. The new concept of birdâs accent is presented to assess the search ability of particles in their local areas. To conserve the diversity of the population during searching, particles are separated into different accent groups by their regional habitation and are classified into different categories of birds/particles in each cluster according to their common manner of singing. A particle in an accent-group can select other particles as its neighbors from its group or from other groups (which sing differently) if the selected particles have the same expertise in singing or are less experienced compared to this particle. To allow the search escaping from local optima, the most expert particles (parents) âdieâ and are regularly replaced by a novice (newborn) randomly generated ones. Moreover, the hybridization of the proposed acMaPSO algorithm with multi-agent systems is suggested. The new variant (named acMaMaPSO) takes advantage of the distribution and interactivity of particle agents. Experimental, numerical and statistical found results show the effectiveness of the two proposed variants compared to different other recent state-of-the-art of many-objective evolutionary algorithms.",multimedia,629,not included

While providing this service with a high quality is the most challenging task, researchers are trying to solve the challenge by giving a more efficient network where congestion, broadband limitations and unsatisfied users are limited. In new multimedia based networks, new challenges move from technology-oriented services to user-oriented services which prove the importance of QoE. Service providers' growth depends nowadays not only on QoS parameters but also on clients' feeling and expectation. That is why; service providers must measure received QoE and this becomes a challenge regarding the evaluation of users' feeling. For users, qualitative perception differs from one user to another and service providers affront difficulties to transform the qualitative values into the quantitative one. The QoE evaluation needs more sophisticated methods to describe the real expectation of users. New multimedia applications provide at any user locations media who are sharing video, and communicating together in virtual network. These applications require providing the best possible QoE to consumers. When it comes to us, we present in this paper a machine learning approach combined with adaptive coding in order to provide a better QoE for video streaming services. This solution will be established using SDN architecture. We can justify this choice because we need a centralized architecture, where the totality of the network is known, to predict its status. So, we will implement a machine learning algorithm in the controller: this algorithm, called ML-based SSIM, will calculate approximately the quality needed for a video to be streamed. Finally, the quality found by the ML-based SSIM Algorithm will be combined with the network situation to choose the right coding. First part of the paper deals with an introduction of QoE requirement, metrics and protocols used especially in streaming services, then we give a complete study around Machine learning algorithms and other fields used in literature to enhance QoE. We define in this paper, at first, QoS and QoE, then the serving environment such as mobile cloud computing and software Defined Network (SDN). Then, we give both objective and subjective metrics, expose mathematical approaches used in modeling, predicting and evaluating QoE. Second, we expose the SSIM approach and explain how our proposed one is based on. The last part of the paper deals with experiments: we describe SDN environment deployment, describe scenarios and finally simulate on SDN emulator some topologies to demonstrate the impact of SDN components helping QoE measurement. At the end, we give the results and values. We highlight the future of our proposition.",multimedia,630,not included

To protect Virtual Machines (VMs) in which CPSs are functioning against malware-based attacks, malware detection and mitigation technique is emerging as a highly crucial concern. The traditional VM-based anti-malware software themselves a potential target for malware-based attack since they are easily subverted by sophisticated malware. Thus, a reliable and robust malware monitoring and detection systems are needed to detect and mitigate rapidly the malware based cyber-attacks in real time particularly for virtualized environment. The Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) has emerged as a fine-grained out-of-VM security solution to detect malware by introspecting and reconstructing the volatile memory state of the live guest Operating System (OS) by functioning at the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) or hypervisor. However, the reconstructed semantic details by the VMI are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor. In order to distinguish between these two states, extensive manual analysis is required by the existing out-of-VM security solutions. To address the foremost issue, in this paper, we propose an advanced VMM-based guest-assisted Automated Multilevel Malware Detection System (AMMDS) that leverages both VMI and Memory Forensic Analysis (MFA) techniques to predict early symptoms of malware execution by detecting stealthy hidden processes on a live guest OS. More specifically, the AMMDS system detects and classifies the actual running malicious executables from the semantically reconstructed process view of the guest OS. The two sub-components of the AMMDS are: Online Malware Detector (OMD) and Offline Malware Classifier (OFMC). The OMD recognizes whether the running processes are benign or malicious using its Local Malware Signature Database (LMSD) and online malware scanner and the OFMC classify unknown malware by adopting machine learning techniques at the hypervisor. The AMMDS has been evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables on to the live guest OSs. The evaluation results achieved 100% of accuracy and zero False Positive Rate (FPR) on the 10-fold cross-validation in classifying unknown malware with maximum performance overhead of 5.8%.",multimedia,631,not included

This thesis therefore investigates how to allow deploying AR systems to any device with an attached camera.

One crucial part of an AR system is the detection of arbitrary objects in the camera frame and naturally accompanying the estimation of their 6D-pose.
This increases the degree of scene understanding that AR applications require for placing augmentations in the real world. Currently, this is limited by a coarse segmentation of the scene into planes as provided by the aforementioned frameworks.
Being able to reliably detect individual objects, allows attaching specific augmentations as required by e.g. AR maintenance applications.
For this, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate the 6D-pose of all visible objects from a single RGB image.
Here, the addressed challenge is the automated training of the respective CNN models, given only the CAD geometry of the target object.
First, we look at reconstructing the missing surface data in real-time before we turn to the more general problem of bridging the domain gap between the non-photorealistic representation and the real world appearance.
To this end, we build upon generative adversarial network (GAN) models to formulate the domain gap as an unsupervised learning problem.
Our evaluation shows an improvement in model performance, while providing a simplified handling compared to alternative solutions.

Furthermore, the calibration data of the used camera must be known for precise pose estimation. This data, again, is only available for the restricted set of devices, that the proprietary frameworks support.
To lift this restriction, we propose a web-based camera calibration service that not only aggregates calibration data, but also guides users in the calibration of new cameras.
Here, we first present a novel calibration-pose selection framework that reduces the number of required calibration images by 30% compared to existing solutions, while ensuring a repeatable and reliable calibration outcome.
Then, we present an evaluation of different user-guidance strategies, which allows choosing a setting suitable for most users.
This enables even novice users to perform a precise camera calibration in about 2 minutes.
Finally, we propose an efficient client-server architecture to deploy the aforementioned guidance on the web, making it available to the widest possible range of devices.
This service is not restricted to AR systems, but allows the general deployment of computer vision algorithms on the web that rely on camera calibration data, which was previously not possible.

These elements combined, allow a semi-automatic deployment of AR systems with any camera to detect any object",multimedia,632,included

The active practice of BVD includes intelligent surveillance and activity recognition, among other challenging tasks. To efficiently address these tasks, the computer vision research community has provided monitoring systems, activity recognition methods, and many other computationally complex solutions for the purposeful usage of BVD. Unfortunately, the limited capabilities of these methods, higher computational complexity, and stringent installation requirements hinder their practical implementation in real-world scenarios, which still demand human operators sitting in front of cameras to monitor activities or make actionable decisions based on BVD. The usage of human-like logic, known as fuzzy logic, has been employed emerging for various data science applications such as control systems, image processing, decision making, routing, and advanced safety-critical systems. This is due to its ability to handle various sources of real world domain and data uncertainties, generating easily adaptable and explainable data-based models. Fuzzy logic can be effectively used for surveillance as a complementary for huge-sized artificial intelligence models and tiresome training procedures. In this paper, we draw researchersâ attention towards the usage of fuzzy logic for surveillance in the context of BVD. We carry out a comprehensive literature survey of methods for vision sensory data analytics that resort to fuzzy logic concepts.

EPC visualizations, and produces predictive classification models by
discovering dominance rules in EPC. By using interactive and automatic
processes it discovers zones in EPC with a high dominance of a single class.
The EPC methodology has been successful in discovering non-linear predictive
models with high coverage and precision in the computational experiments. This
can benefit multiple domains by producing visually appealing dominance rules.

Itinerari nell'Italia del Novecento",2019-01-01 00:00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/288644199.pdf,,"La   questione   minorile   Ã¨   stata   ripercorsa   dalla storiografia soprattutto attraverso il prisma della repressione e prevenzione; nellâItalia  del  Novecento  il  bisogno  di  controllo  sociale,  âpensiero dominanteâ, ha complicato la costruzione del diritto peri minori e deiminori.La codificazione civile, âa misura di adultoâ, assegnava infatti i diritti al soggetto razionale ed autonomo, quasi a riproporre lâimpostazione del paternalismo liberale di Stuart Mill, a proposito di minori da proteggere in primo luogo da se stessi. Lâordinamento contemplava i minori soprattutto per imporgli lââantico onora il padreâ;anche se il codice civile del 1942 non prevedeva  una  soggezione  totale  dei  figli  rispetto  alla  potestÃ   genitoriale, prima  del  fascismo  ed  ancoranegli  anni  Cinquanta  la  patria  potestÃ   era intesa come ârimedioâ allâincapacitÃ  di agire del figlio, ostacolo allâÂ«azione dello StatoÂ» nellâordine e disordine della famiglia. Agli inizi del secolo la Â«protezione giuridica dei minorenniÂ» pareva Â«sconosciuta al nostro diritto e fuori della legislazioneÂ», inadeguata soprattutto nellâimpietoso paragone con la legislazione europea e dâoltreoceano; la comparazione con un âaltrove feliceâ âin primo luogo il Children Actdel 1908 âsarebbe stata una costante nelle politiche nazionali per lâinfanzia ed adolescenza, dalla Circolaredel guardasigilli V.E. Orlando al Progetto di Codice per i minorenni.Lontano dallo âspecialismoâ âcifra della scientia iurisnazionale âil diritto minorile aveva vocazione âinterdisciplinareâ, nel poggiare soprattutto sul legame tra diritto e pedagogia; nel 1910 Orlando parlava allâIstituto pedago-gico forense di Milano del dirittoâda sempre e per sempreâ preminente per i minori, quello alla Â«protezione educativaÂ», allâÂ«educazione, siapure  for-zataÂ».  NellâItalia  liberale  era  ampio  il  dibattito  e  significativa  la  pro-gettazione; ne era un âultimo attoâ il ProgettoFerri, inteso a distinguere tra bambini e adolescenti e a costruire una giustizia penale speciale rispetto a quella per gli adulti. Negli anni del fascismo âanche in questa materia tuttâal-tro  che  parentesi âera invece serrata la legislazione, con lâistituzione dellâOpera nazionale maternitÃ  e infanzia âattiva fino al 1975 âlâOpera na-zionale Balilla, il Tribunale per i minorenni (Rd. 1404/1934). Il regime inten-deva  marcare  il  passaggiodella  questione  minorile  dal  campo  penale  a quello Â«socialeÂ»; era centrale la Â«rieducazioneÂ», come ribadito nel 1941 dal guardasigilli Dino Grandi. Il Rd. 140/1934 si ricollegava alla codificazione pe-nale e penal-processuale (1930), ed era âapripistaâ della codificazione civile (1942). Nella dottrina degli anni Cinquanta lâÂ«autonomiaÂ»del diritto minorile na-sceva con il Tribunale per i minori; cenni sporadici erano riservati alla Costi-tuzione  ed  alla  Dichiarazionedi  Ginevra  dei  diritti  universali  dei  bambini (1924). Pur in un orizzonte meramente esortatorio, in seguito le fonti inter-nazionali avrebbero avrebbero âincalzatoâ il legislatore italiano,soprattutto sul piano, problematico, dellâattuazione dei principi. Il  diritto  minorile  si sviluppava inoltre come sorta di judge made lawâcostruito sopratutto dai presidenti del Tribunale dei minori, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone,  Occhiogrosso,  Fadiga âprofilo  problematico  per  la  prevalente cultura giuridica legalista italiana, ostile allâampio potere discrezionale, eser-citato dal giudice specializzato in materia giurisdizionale ed amministrativa. Nel 1951 nasceva inoltre lâUnione italiana giudici per minorenni, poi Associa-zione, motore del processo legislativo; nel 1971 era istituita la pianta orga-nica del Â«giudice specializzatoÂ».Il  diritto  minorile  era  complicato  dai  cambiamenti  di  costume,  che investivano  la  societÃ :  nel  primoNovecento  il  dibattito tra  giuristi,  giudici, politici, scienziati sociali era iscritto nellâorizzonte della autoritÃ ,paterna e/o dello  Stato,  non  in  quello  della  libertÃ   ed  autonomia  del  minore.  Con  un cambio di prospettiva, allâAssemblea Costituente Aldo Moro tematizzava un diritto  Â«problematicoÂ»,  stante  lâincapacitÃ   di  agire  del  soggetto,  ma Â«autenticoÂ». Quasi ad anticipare il best interest of the child, la legge 431/67 âdetta  dellâadozione  speciale âattribuiva   al   Tribunale   il   compito   di Â«promuovere e difendere i diritti del minoreÂ». Elia ârelatore di una densa sentenza  della  Consulta  del  1981 âsostenne che il âcentro di gravitÃ â del sistema passava dallââinteresse dallâadottante a quello dellâadottatoâ. Ma non    mancavano    problemi:    davanti    ai    concretissimi    drammi    sulla destinazione del bambino âmadre sola e problematica o Istituto âJemolo si chiedeva Â«dovâÃ¨ lâinteresse del minoreÂ», interrogativo a suo avviso non sciolto dalla legge, che aveva affidato al giudice Â«un compito che non Ã¨ suoÂ». Anche il mondo del diritto era lambito da nuove sensibilitÃ  e trasformazioni sociali: alla metÃ  degli anni Settanta siponevail tema del Â«metodoÂ», con la trasformazione  del  Â«diritto  minorileÂ»,  da  Â«diritto  dei  minori  a  diritto  dei diritti dei minoriÂ». Con la riforma del diritto di famiglia del 1975 il Â«vecchioÂ» diritto  minorile  pareva  destinato  a  lasciare  il  posto  ad  uno  Â«nuovoÂ»;perAlfredo  Carlo  Moro  tramontava  il  soggetto  Â«unificatoÂ»,ed  entravano  in scena Â«Pierino, MariaÂ»; alla luce della Convenzione internazionale dei diritti del fanciullo del 1989, ratificata in Italia due anni dopo, Moro affermava che il discorso sui Â«dirittiÂ» doveva poggiare sulla Â«attuazioneÂ». Dâaltro canto si osservava  che  il  legislatore  non  poteva  stabilire  per  legge  i  contenuti  dei diritti âprimo di tutti quello allâeducazione âse  non  con  criteri  generali  e astratti,   e   che   il  minore  non  era  considerato  dallâordinamento  come soggetto di diritto, ma come destinatario di decisioni prese da altri, genitori, tutori, giudici. Nel 1970 Cividali metteva in scena un Â«giudice nuovoÂ», impegnato a pro-muovere i diritti del minore, empatico con la Â«personaÂ», piÃ¹ che intento ad applicare âfreddamenteâ la legge. La polaritÃ  tra il rispetto delle norme, a tu-tela di tuttii bambini, e la decisione nel migliore interessedi quelparticolare bambino, anche contravvenendo alla legge, irrompeva con il âcaso celebreâ di Serena Cruz, tolta dal Tribunale per i minorenni di Torino alla famiglia, che lâaveva adottata illegalmente; quel âcaso celebreâ metteva in scena il corto circuito tra legalitÃ  e Â«vera giustiziaÂ». Quanto al rapporto tra minori e istitu-zioni, intese alla rieducazione, la prassi mostra che, dal fascismo alla repub-blica, alla Â«discontinuitÃ   politicaÂ»Ã¨  corrisposta  una Â«continuitÃ   istituzio-naleÂ», anche nella violenza esercitata sui minori; da qui una âprovocazioneâ, la creazione di un Â«Tribunale per la difesa dei minoriÂ». Neppure il codice di procedura penale minorile del 1988, inteso a Â«educare responsabilizzandoÂ», Ã¨ parso assicurare ai minorenni una efficace Â«garanziaÂ».The juvenile question has been traced by historiography above all through the prism of repression and prevention; in twentieth-cen-tury Italy the need for social control, ""dominant thought"", has complicated the construction of the right for minors and minors. In fact, civil codification, ""adult-friendly"", assigned the rights to the rational and autonomous subject, as if to re-propose the liberal paternalism of Stuart Mill, about minors to be protected  in  the  first  place  by  themselves.  The  system  envisaged  minors above all to impose the ancient on it honors the father; even if the civil code of  1942  did  not  foresee  a  total  subjection  of  the  children  with  respect  to parental authority, before fascism and still in the fifties the parental author-ity was understood as 'remedy' to the inability to act of the child, obstacle to the action of the State in the order and disorder of the family. At the be-ginning of the century the ""legal protection of minors"" seemed ""unknown to our law and outside the law"", inadequate especially in the pitiless compari-son with European and overseas legislation; the comparison with a âhappy elsewhereâ -first and foremost the Children Act of 1908 -would have been a constant in national policies for children and adolescents, from the Circular of the Minister of Justice V.E. Orlando to the Code Project for minors.Far from âspecialismâ -a figure of the italian scientia iuris-the juvenile law had an âinterdisciplinaryâ figure, based above all on the link between law and pedagogy; in 1910 Orlando was speaking at the Milan Forensic Pedagogical Institute  of the  ""always  and forever""  pre-eminent  right for  minors, that of ""educational protection"", ""education, albeit forced"". In liberal Italy the plan-ning was significant and the debate was significant; the Ferri Project was a 'final act', intended to distinguish between children and adolescents and to build a special criminal justice system with respect to that for adults. In the years of fascism -even in this matter anything but parenthesis -legislation was tightened, with the institution of the Maternity and Childhood National Opera -active until 1975 -the Balilla National Opera, the Juvenile Court (Rd.1404/1934). The regime intended to mark the passage of the juvenile issue from the criminal to the ""social"" field; ""re-education"" was central, as reiter-ated in 1941 by the Minister of Justice Dino Grandi. Rd. 140/1934 was linked to the penal  and  penal-procedural  codification  (1930)  and  was  a  ""forerun-ner"" of civil codification (1942). In the doctrine of the 1950s the ""autonomy"" of juvenile law was born with the juvenile court; sporadic notes were reserved for the Constitution and the Geneva Declaration of Universal Children's Rights (1924). Despite a merely exhortatory  horizon,  the  international  sources  later  allegedly  ""urged""  the Italian legislator, above all on the problematic level of implementation of the principles.  The  juvenile  law  developed  as  a  sort  of  judge  made  law -built above all by the presidents of the juvenile court, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone, Occhiogrosso, Fadiga -problematic profile for the prevailing  legalistic  Italian  legal  culture,  hostile  to  the  wide  discretion, exercised  by  the  judge  specialized  in  jurisdictional  and  administrative matters. In 1951 the Italian Union of judges for minors was also born, then the  Association,  the  engine  of  the  legislative  process;  in  1971  the  organic plan of the ""specialized judge"" was established.The  juvenile  law  was  complicated  by  the  changes  of  custom,  which invested  the  society:  in  the  early  twentieth  century  the  debate  between jurists, judges, politicians, social scientists was inscribed in the horizon of the paternal and / or state authority, not in that of freedom and autonomy of the minor. With a change of perspective, at the Constituent Assembly Aldo Moro discussed a ""problematic"" right, given the subject's inability to act, but ""authentic"".  Asif  to  anticipate  the  best  interest  of  the  child,  law  431/67 -called  special  adoption -gave  the  Court  the  task  of  ""promoting  and defending  the  rights  of  the  child"".  Elia -who  was  the  speaker  of  a  dense sentence of the Consulta in 1981 -argued that the ""center of gravity"" of the system shifted ""from the interest of the adopter to the one adopted"". But there were problems: in front of the very real dramas about the destination of  the  child -single  and  problematic  mother  or  Institute -Jemolo  asked himself  ""where  is  the  minor's  interest"",  a  question  in  his  opinion  not dissolved by the law, which he had entrusted to the judge a task that is not his. Even  the  world  of  law  was  surrounded  by  new  sensitivities  and  social transformations:  in  the  mid-seventies  the  theme  of  the  ""method""  was posed,  with  the  transformation  of  the  ""juvenile  right"",  from  ""the  right  of minors to the rights of minors' rights"".

This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technologyâs practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholdersâconsumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industriesâand their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumersâ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumersâ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets. The study, being the first to explore real estate technologies, is limited by the number of research publications on the SRE technologies that has been compensated through incorporation of online reports",multimedia,640,not included

The new implementation, which is coded in C++ and takes advantage of the parallelization functionalities both on CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units), was validated using different benchmark cases and compared, in terms of numerical output and computational efficiency, with other well-known hydraulic software packages. Depending on the complexity of the specific test case, the new parallel implementation can achieve speedups up to two orders of magnitude when compared with the standard version. The speedup is especially remarkable for the GPU parallelization that uses Nvidia CUDA (compute unified device architecture). The efficiency is as good as the one provided by some of the most popular hydraulic models. We also present the application of Iber+ to model an extreme flash flood that took place in the Spanish Pyrenees in October 2012. The new implementation was used to simulate 24 h of real time in roughly eight minutes of computing time, while the standard version needed more than 15 h. This huge improvement in computational efficiency opens up the possibility of using the code for real-time forecasting of flood events in early-warning systems, in order to help decision making under hazardous events that need a fast intervention to deploy countermeasures.Water JPIâWaterWorks Programme, project Improving

In fact, civil codification, ""adult-friendly"", assigned the rights to the rational and autonomous subject, as if to re-propose the liberal paternalism of Stuart Mill, about minors to be protected in the first place by themselves. The system envisaged minors above all to impose the ancient on it honors the father; even if the civil code of 1942 did not foresee a total subjection of the children with respect to parental authority, before fascism and still in the fifties the parental authority was understood as 'remedy' to the inability to act of the child, obstacle to the action of the State in the order and disorder of the family. At the beginning of the century the ""legal protection of minors"" seemed ""unknown to our law and outside the law"", inadequate especially in the pitiless comparison with European and overseas legislation; the comparison with a âhappy elsewhereâ - first and foremost the Children Act of 1908 - would have been a constant in national policies for children and adolescents, from the Circular of the Minister of Justice V.E. Orlando to the Code Project for minors.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from âspecialismâ - a figure of the italian scientia iuris - the juvenile law had an âinterdisciplinaryâ figure, based above all on the link between law and pedagogy; in 1910 Orlando was speaking at the Milan Forensic Pedagogical Institute of the ""always and forever"" pre-eminent right for minors, that of ""educational protection"", ""education, albeit forced"". In liberal Italy the planning was significant and the debate was significant; the Ferri Project was a 'final act', intended to distinguish between children and adolescents and to build a special criminal justice system with respect to that for adults. In the years of fascism - even in this matter anything but parenthesis - legislation was tightened, with the institution of the Maternity and Childhood National Opera - active until 1975 - the Balilla National Opera, the Juvenile Court (Rd . 1404/1934). The regime intended to mark the passage of the juvenile issue from the criminal to the ""social"" field; ""re-education"" was central, as reiterated in 1941 by the Minister of Justice Dino Grandi. Rd. 140/1934 was linked to the penal and penal-procedural codification (1930) and was a ""forerunner"" of civil codification (1942).
In the doctrine of the 1950s the ""autonomy"" of juvenile law was born with the juvenile court; sporadic notes were reserved for the Constitution and the Geneva Declaration of Universal Children's Rights (1924). Despite a merely exhortatory horizon, the international sources later allegedly ""urged"" the Italian legislator, above all on the problematic level of implementation of the principles. The juvenile law developed as a sort of judge made law - built above all by the presidents of the juvenile court, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone, Occhiogrosso, Fadiga - problematic profile for the prevailing legalistic Italian legal culture, hostile to the wide discretion, exercised by the judge specialized in jurisdictional and administrative matters. In 1951 the Italian Union of judges for minors was also born, then the Association, the engine of the legislative process; in 1971 the organic plan of the ""specialized judge"" was established.
The juvenile law was complicated by the changes of custom, which invested the society: in the early twentieth century the debate between jurists, judges, politicians, social scientists was inscribed in the horizon of the paternal and / or state authority, not in that of freedom and autonomy of the minor. With a change of perspective, at the Constituent Assembly Aldo Moro discussed a ""problematic"" right, given the subject's inability to act, but ""authentic"". As if to anticipate the best interest of the child, law 431/67 - called special adoption - gave the Court the task of ""promoting and defending the rights of the child"". Elia - who was the speaker of a dense sentence of the Consulta in 1981 - argued that the ""center of gravity"" of the system shifted ""from the interest of the adopter to the one adopted"". But there were problems: in front of the very real dramas about the destination of the child - single and problematic mother or Institute - Jemolo asked himself ""where is the minor's interest"", a question in his opinion not dissolved by the law, which he had entrusted to the judge a task that is not his. Even the world of law was surrounded by new sensitivities and social transformations: in the mid-seventies the theme of the ""method"" was posed, with the transformation of the ""juvenile right"", from ""the right of minors to the rights of minors' rights"". With the family law reform of 1975, the ""old"" child law seemed destined to give way to a ""new"" one; for Alfredo Carlo Moro set the ""unified"" subject, and ""Pierino, Maria"" entered the scene; in the light of the 1989 International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified in Italy two years later, Moro affirmed that the discourse on ""rights"" had to rest on ""implementation"".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1970 Cividali staged a ""new judge"", committed to promoting the rights of the child, empathetic with the ""person"", rather than intent on applying the law ""coldly"". The polarity between the respect of the rules, for the protection of all children, and the decision in the best interest of that particular child, even in contravention of the law, burst with the 'famous case' of Serena Cruz, removed by the Turin Juvenile Court to the family, who had adopted it illegally; that ""celebrated case"" staged the gap between legality and ""true justice"". As for the relationship between minors and institutions, meant for re-education, the practice shows that, from fascism to the republic, political discontinuity is matched by institutional continuity, even in the violence exercised on minors; hence the ""provocation"", the creation of a ""Tribunal for the defense of minors"". Not even the 1988 Code of Juvenile Criminal Procedure, intended to ""educate by empowering"", seemed to ensure an effective ""guarantee"" for minors.La questione minorile Ã¨ stata ripercorsa dalla storiografia soprattutto attraverso il prisma della repressione e prevenzione; nellâItalia del Novecento il bisogno di controllo sociale, âpensiero dominanteâ, ha complicato la costruzione del diritto per i minori e dei minori. La codificazione civile, âa misura di adultoâ, assegnava infatti i diritti al soggetto razionale ed autonomo, quasi a riproporre lâimpostazione del paternalismo liberale di Stuart Mill, a proposito di minori da proteggere in primo luogo da se stessi. Lâordinamento contemplava i minori soprattutto per imporgli lââantico onora il padreâ;&nbsp;anche se il codice civile del 1942 non prevedeva una soggezione totale dei figli rispetto alla potestÃ  genitoriale, prima del fascismo ed ancora negli anni Cinquanta la patria potestÃ  era intesa come ârimedioâ allâincapacitÃ  di agire del figlio, ostacolo allâÂ«azione dello StatoÂ» nellâordine e disordine della famiglia. Agli inizi del secolo la Â«protezione giuridica dei minorenniÂ» pareva Â«sconosciuta al nostro diritto e fuori della legislazioneÂ», inadeguata soprattutto nellâimpietoso paragone con la legislazione europea e dâoltreoceano; la comparazione con un âaltrove feliceâ â in primo luogo il Children Act del 1908 â sarebbe stata una costante nelle politiche nazionali per lâinfanzia ed adolescenza, dalla Circolare del guardasigilli V.E. Orlando al Progetto di Codice per i minorenni.
Lontano dallo âspecialismoâ â cifra della scientia iuris nazionale â il diritto minorile aveva vocazione âinterdisciplinareâ, nel poggiare soprattutto sul legame tra diritto e pedagogia; nel 1910 Orlando parlava allâIstituto pedagogico forense di Milano del diritto&nbsp; âda sempre e per sempreâ preminente per i minori, quello alla Â«protezione educativaÂ», allâÂ«educazione, sia pure forzataÂ». NellâItalia liberale era ampio il dibattito e significativa la progettazione; ne era un âultimo attoâ il Progetto Ferri, inteso a distinguere tra bambini e adolescenti e a costruire una giustizia penale speciale rispetto a quella per gli adulti. Negli anni del fascismo â anche in questa materia tuttâaltro che parentesi â era invece serrata la legislazione, con lâistituzione dellâOpera nazionale maternitÃ  e infanzia â attiva fino al 1975 â lâOpera nazionale Balilla, il Tribunale per i minorenni (Rd. 1404/1934). Il regime intendeva marcare il passaggio della questione minorile dal campo penale a quello Â«socialeÂ»; era centrale la Â«rieducazioneÂ», come ribadito nel 1941 dal guardasigilli Dino Grandi. Il Rd. 140/1934 si ricollegava alla codificazione penale e penal-processuale (1930), ed era âapripistaâ della codificazione civile (1942).
Nella dottrina degli anni Cinquanta lâÂ«autonomiaÂ» del diritto minorile nasceva con il Tribunale per i minori; cenni sporadici erano riservati alla Costituzione ed alla Dichiarazione di Ginevra dei diritti universali dei bambini (1924). Pur in un orizzonte meramente esortatorio, in seguito le fonti internazionali avrebbero avrebbero âincalzatoâ il legislatore italiano, soprattutto sul piano, problematico, dellâattuazione dei principi. Il diritto minorile si sviluppava inoltre come sorta di judge made law â costruito sopratutto dai presidenti del Tribunale dei minori, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone, Occhiogrosso, Fadiga â profilo problematico per la prevalente cultura giuridica legalista italiana, ostile allâampio potere discrezionale, esercitato dal giudice specializzato in materia giurisdizionale ed amministrativa. Nel 1951 nasceva inoltre lâUnione italiana giudici per minorenni, poi Associazione, motore del processo legislativo; nel 1971 era istituita la pianta organica del Â«giudice specializzatoÂ».
Il diritto minorile era complicato dai cambiamenti di costume, che investivano la societÃ : nel primo Novecento il dibattito tra giuristi, giudici, politici, scienziati sociali era iscritto nellâorizzonte della autoritÃ , paterna e/o dello Stato, non in quello della libertÃ  ed autonomia del minore. Con un cambio di prospettiva, allâAssemblea Costituente Aldo Moro tematizzava un diritto Â«problematicoÂ», stante lâincapacitÃ  di agire del soggetto, ma Â«autenticoÂ». Quasi ad anticipare il best interest of the child, la legge 431/67 â detta dellâadozione speciale â attribuiva al Tribunale il compito di Â«promuovere e difendere i diritti del minoreÂ». Elia â relatore di una densa sentenza della Consulta del 1981 â sostenne che il âcentro di gravitÃ â del sistema passava dallââinteresse dallâadottante a quello dellâadottatoâ. Ma non mancavano problemi: davanti ai concretissimi drammi sulla destinazione del bambino â madre sola e problematica o Istituto â Jemolo si chiedeva Â«dovâÃ¨ lâinteresse del minoreÂ», interrogativo a suo avviso non sciolto dalla legge, che aveva affidato al giudice Â«un compito che non Ã¨ suoÂ». Anche il mondo del diritto era lambito da nuove sensibilitÃ  e trasformazioni sociali: alla metÃ  degli anni Settanta si poneva il tema del Â«metodoÂ», con la trasformazione del Â«diritto minorileÂ», da Â«diritto dei minori a diritto dei diritti dei minoriÂ». Con la riforma del diritto di famiglia del 1975 il Â«vecchioÂ» diritto minorile pareva destinato a lasciare il posto ad uno Â«nuovoÂ»;&nbsp; per Alfredo Carlo Moro tramontava il soggetto Â«unificatoÂ»,&nbsp;ed entravano in scena Â«Pierino, MariaÂ»; alla luce della Convenzione internazionale dei diritti del fanciullo del 1989, ratificata in Italia due anni dopo, Moro affermava che il discorso sui Â«dirittiÂ» doveva poggiare sulla Â«attuazioneÂ». Dâaltro canto si osservava che il legislatore non poteva stabilire per legge i contenuti dei diritti â primo di tutti quello allâeducazione â se non con criteri generali e astratti, e che il minore non era considerato dallâordinamento come soggetto di diritto, ma come destinatario di decisioni prese da altri, genitori, tutori, giudici.
Nel 1970 Cividali metteva in scena un Â«giudice nuovoÂ», impegnato a promuovere i diritti del minore, empatico con la Â«personaÂ», piÃ¹ che intento ad applicare âfreddamenteâ la legge. La polaritÃ  tra il rispetto delle norme, a tutela di tutti i bambini, e la decisione nel migliore interesse di quel particolare bambino, anche contravvenendo alla legge, irrompeva con il âcaso celebreâ di Serena Cruz, tolta dal Tribunale per i minorenni di Torino alla famiglia, che lâaveva adottata illegalmente; quel âcaso celebreâ metteva in scena il corto circuito tra legalitÃ  e Â«vera giustiziaÂ». Quanto al rapporto tra minori e istituzioni, intese alla rieducazione, la prassi mostra che, dal fascismo alla repubblica, alla Â«discontinuitÃ  politicaÂ» Ã¨ corrisposta una Â«continuitÃ  istituzionaleÂ», anche nella violenza esercitata sui minori; da qui una âprovocazioneâ, la creazione di un Â«Tribunale per la difesa dei minoriÂ». Neppure il codice di procedura penale minorile del 1988, inteso a Â«educare responsabilizzandoÂ», Ã¨ parso assicurare ai minorenni una efficace Â«garanziaÂ»",multimedia,642,not included

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multi-neuronal spike pattern detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike latency, which enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and heterosynaptic plasticity, which allows the own regulation of synaptic weights. From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multi-dimensional, temporal, feature space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to experimental data obtained from a motor-inhibitory cognitive task. The results show that out method exhibits similar performance compared with other classification methods, indicating the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, its simplicity and low computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface, personal biometrics authentication, or early detection of diseases.GS acknowledges financial support by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (PTA-2015-10395-I).

One such animation technique that has been widely used in the animation and visual effects industry is called \u22rotoscoping\u22 and has allowed uniquely stylized animations to capture the motion of real life action sequences, however it is a very complex and time consuming process. Automating this arduous technique would free animators from performing frame by frame stylization and allow them to concentrate on their own artistic contributions. This thesis introduces a new artificial system based on an existing neural style transfer method which creates artistically stylized animations that simultaneously reproduce both the motion of the original videos that they are derived from and the unique style of a given artistic work. This system utilizes a convolutional neural network framework to extract a hierarchy of image features used for generating images that appear visually similar to a given artistic style while at the same time faithfully preserving temporal content. The use of optical flow allows the combination of style and content to be integrated directly with the apparent motion over frames of a video to produce smooth and visually appealing transitions. The implementation described in this thesis demonstrates how biologically-inspired systems such as convolutional neural networks are rapidly approaching human-level behavior in tasks that were once thought impossible for computers. Such a complex task elucidates the current and future technical and artistic capabilities of such biologically-inspired neural systems as their horizons expand exponentially. Further, this research provides unique insights into the way that humans perceive and utilize temporal information in everyday tasks. A secondary implementation that is explored in this thesis seeks to improve existing convolutional neural networks using a biological approach to the way these models adapt to their inputs. This implementation shows how these pattern recognition systems can be greatly improved by integrating recent neuroscience research into already biologically inspired systems.

Places provide an environment for people to communicate, share perspectives, and in the process form new social connections. Due to the active role of places to the social fabric of city life, it is important to understand how people perceive and experience places. One fundamental construct that relates place and experience is ambiance, i.e., the impressions we ubiquitously form when we go out. Young people are key actors of urban life, specially at night, and as such play an equal role in co-creating and appropriating the urban space. Understanding how places and their youth inhabitants interact at night is a relevant urban issue. Until recently, our ability to assess the visual and perceptual qualities of urban spaces and to study the dynamics surrounding youth experiences in those spaces have been limited partly due to the lack of quantitative data. However, the growth of computational methods and tools including sensor-rich mobile devices, social multimedia platforms, and crowdsourcing tools have opened ways to measure urban perception at scale, and to deepen our understanding of nightlife as experienced by young people. In this thesis, as a first contribution, we present the design, implementation and computational analysis of four mobile crowdsensing studies involving youth populations from various countries to understand and infer phenomena related to urban places and people. We gathered a variety of explicit and implicit crowdsourced data including mobile sensor data and logs, survey responses, and multimedia content (images and videos) from hundreds of crowdworkers and thousands of users of mobile social networks. Second, we showed how crowdsensed images can be used for the computational characterization and analysis of urban perception in indoor and outdoor places. For both place types, urban perception impressions were elicited for several physical and psychological constructs using online crowdsourcing. Using low-level and deep learning features extracted from images, we automatically inferred crowdsourced judgments of indoor ambiance with a maximum R2 of 0.53 and outdoor perception with a maximum R2 of 0.49. Third, we demonstrated the feasibility to collect rich contextual data to study the physical mobility, activities, ambiance context, and social patterns of youth nightlife behavior. Fourth, using supervised machine learning techniques, we automatically classified drinking behavior of young people in an urban, real nightlife setting. Using features extracted from mobile sensor data and application logs, we obtained an overall accuracy of 76.7%. While this thesis contributes towards understanding urban perception and youth nightlife patterns in specific contexts, our research also contributes towards the computational understanding of urban places at scale with high spatial and temporal resolution, using a combination of mobile crowdsensing, social media, machine learning, multimedia analysis, and online crowdsourcing",multimedia,645,not included

data mining (SDM). It uses a multigene variant of the biologically inspired
machine learning method of genetic programming (MGGP) as the engine that drives
the automatic model discovery process. Symbolic data mining is the process of
extracting hidden, meaningful relationships from data in the form of symbolic
equations. In contrast to other data-mining methods, the structural
transparency of the generated predictive equations can give new insights into
the physical systems or processes that generated the data. Furthermore, this
transparency makes the models very easy to deploy outside of MATLAB. The
rationale behind GPTIPS is to reduce the technical barriers to using,
understanding, visualising and deploying GP based symbolic models of data,
whilst at the same time remaining highly customisable and delivering robust
numerical performance for power users. In this chapter, notable new features of
the latest version of the software are discussed with these aims in mind.
Additionally, a simplified variant of the MGGP high level gene crossover
mechanism is proposed. It is demonstrated that the new functionality of GPTIPS

For this purpose, biosensors using printed circuits composed from graphene microelectrodes using stabilized lipid membranes were constructed and developed.A number of particular methodologies were used to embody various receptors such as enzymes (urease and cholesterol oxidase) and an antibody (antibody D-dimer) in the sensors.Various physicochemical and instrumental methods of analysis, eg., differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectrophotometry, etc., were used to locate the position of the receptor (eg. antibody, enzyme, etc.) into the stabilized lipid membrane of the sensor and the mechanism of signal generation.The response of the sensor to various potentially toxic substrates eg. urea (urease immobilization), cholesterol (cholesterol oxidase immobilization) and D-dimer (immobilizing antibody D-dimer) and its stability with time were studied.For example, the response of urea biosensor towards various urea concentrations was found to have high sensitivity (ca. 70 mV/ concentration decade) over a range of urea concentrations between 1 Î§ 10â6 Î - 1 Î§ 10â3 Î. The response of cholesterol biosensor towards various concentrations of the substrate were also found to be highly sensitive (ca. 64 mV/ concentration decade) over a concentration range between 1 Î§ 10â6 Î - 1 Î§ 10â3 Î; this sensitivity is larger than those provided up to date in the literature. Finally the response of the D-dimer immunosensor was found satisfactory over a wide concentration range of analyte (10-6 Î¼g/ mL - 10-3 Î¼g/ mL) with a sensitivity of ca. 59 mV/ concentration decade with a rapid response of 15 s.The selectivity of the sensor construction method and on how to limit interferences were studied so that the sensor could be applied in real samples. The conditions for satisfactory stability and reproducibility of the chemical sensors were thoroughly studied and their construction into nanoscale was investigated.The results of the implementation of the constructed devices in real samples were satisfactory and show the possibility of construction of portable chemical sensors for the detection of toxicants for first time in the literature with many advantages, which can be used in the future as alternative systems instead of the time consuming, costly and complex chromatographic methods of analysis.Î ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ± Î´Î¹Î±ÏÏÎ¹Î²Î® ÎµÎ¼Î²Î¬Î¸ÏÎ½Îµ Î³Î¹Î± ÏÏÏÏÎ· ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¬ ÏÏÎ·Î½ ÎºÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÎºÎµÏÎ® ÏÎ·Î¼Î¹ÎºÏÎ½ Î±Î¹ÏÎ¸Î·ÏÎ®ÏÏÎ½ Î³Î¹Î± ÏÎ·Î½ ÏÎ±ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î±Î½Î¯ÏÎ½ÎµÏÏÎ· ÏÎ¿Î¾Î¹ÎºÏÎ½ Î¿ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎ½.

This is achieved through analysis, modeling, implementation and simulation of artificial markets populated by software agents that represent economic self interested agents. Software agents are the constructs of a complex system, an artificial market that model a real existing market or an outline of a market design. The interest in simulating a market is multiple: exploiting existing market rules, searching for market design flaws and loopholes, and supporting decision making during a market mechanism design process. The main aim of the suggested approach is to analyze the behavior that emerges from the interaction of self interested agents acting in an artificial market. AEMAS (Artificial Economy MultiAgent System), a multiagent system architecture inspired by the Market Oriented Programming (MOP) approach is defined. In different economical sectors, e.g. energy markets, there is no consensus about which structures lead to social welfare maximization outcomes. An approach to find adequate architectures allows different market structure instances to be created and simulated, to ease the design and analysis of alternative structures. These alternatives can then be compared and potential design flaws eventually risen by simulation identified. Taking the electricity market as an example, two instances of the proposed architecture are presented, corresponding to the centralized dispatch arrangement common to non restructured markets, and the auction based pool, common to restructured markets.

In this paper, advanced data analysis, neural networks and knowledge representation technologies are brought together towards an intelligent information system for tourist destination marketing. In previous work, knowledge engineering methods were proposed for the extraction and modeling from market survey data of factors, associations, clusters and hidden patterns that explain a market phenomenon or customer behavior. The feasibility of managing these findings in a Knowledge-Base, as reusable, sharable and machine understandable knowledge was shown using preliminary results from primary surveys on the tourism of Thessaloniki. In the current work, we present the continuation of these developments, including: (a) the final results of the survey on the tourism of Thessaloniki, (b) a refined Knowledge Base filled with real and validated content derived from the analysis of the full-scale survey data, (c) the extension of the methods with an artificial neural network classifier and (d) the deployment of an inference engine and a query mechanism in order to exercise the knowledge content for decision support. Pilot trials showed that the intelligent system was able to assist users who are not experts in analysis to solve typical destination marketing problems",multimedia,649,not included

This paper shows the implementation on a real Khepera II robot of an immuno-genetic network for autonomous navigation that combines an evolutionary algorithm with a continuous immune network model. The proposed immuno-genetic system has the immune network implementing a dynamic process of decision-making, and the evolutionary algorithm defining the network structure. To be able to evaluate the controllers (immune networks) on the evolutionary process, a virtual environment was used for computer simulation, based on the characteristics of the navigation problem. The immune networks obtained by evolution were then analyzed and tested on new situations, presenting coordination capability in simple and more complex tasks. Some preliminary experiments on a real Khepera II robot demonstrate the feasibility of the evolved immune networks.

Ã lâimage des Ãªtres vivants, les diffÃ©rences de perception du milieu environnant devraient permettre de voir naÃ®tre des particularitÃ©s et des comportements diffÃ©rents pour chacun dâentre eux.

Animats are agents minimally equipped on the mechanical plan as well as in terms of computing power. Nevertheless, the theory describing the study of these entities aims at discovering learning methods allowing them to evolve using what they learnt from their experience in the environment. Just like human beings, differences in perception of the surrounding environment should allow peculiarities and several behaviors for each of them. Besides, these animats should be able to communicate between them so as to allow, if needed, to share information and to use common knowledge and learning in order to succeed in what should be their main objective: survive in their environment. 
The research field of animats includes the study of simulated and real animats. While the former allows a facilitated deployment due to the abstraction made possible by high-level languages, the necessity to emulate an environment with all peculiarities can lead to modeling errors that may be avoided when animats are physically built. Consequently, if such a platform was available, it would only be necessary to focus on the learning algorithms rather than on the modelling problems. Besides, very often, powerful algorithms tested on simulation may prove themselves unsuitable for real problems in real environments. For instance, it is hard to predict what would happen if a sensor became defective, if an unexpected situation was met, or if the noise or the precision of the sensors was not properly modeled.In this context, we suggest studying and designing what will be the base of a platform for development and analysis of learning algorithms. Unlike the existing platforms, the main originality of this platform lies in the consideration of energy constraints. Indeed, to enhance its survivability, the animat should be able to estimate and to plan its present and future energy consumption and to consider it in the choices made. Besides, the objective was to design an animat sufficiently equipped to realize simple tasks but relatively primitive to make it necessary to take advantage of algorithmic parades, like for example the pooling of information. Therefore, the computing power embedded in the animat was purposely reduced to force the relocation of processing that proves too complex. On the other hand, a reduced size and a moderate price are necessary features to enable deployment of a colony of animats",multimedia,653,not included

Such dialogue systems must not only understand student speech, but must also endeavor to keep students engaged while scaffolding them through the curriculum. Crafting robust, natural tutoring interactions typically involves writing tightly scripted behaviors for a wide variety of student responses and scenarios.
Combining statistical machine learning with corpus-based methods in natural language processing presents a possible path to reducing this effort. Advances in reinforcement learning have been applied toward dialogue systems to learn optimal behaviors for a given task. However, these learned dialogue policies are tightly coupled to the specific dialogue system implementation. For content-rich applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, there is an immediate need to learn tutoring strategies and dialogue behaviors that can be leveraged across a variety of materials, concepts and lessons. Further generalization will require an intermediate representation of dialogue that can abstract the conversation to its underlying action, function, and content.
This work introduces the Dialogue Schema Unifying Speech and Semantics (DISCUSS), an intermediate linguistic representation that captures the semantics and pragmatics of speech while also allowing for domain-independent modeling of tutorial dialogue. To better understand the benefits of the DISCUSS representation, a corpus of computer-mediated tutorial dialogues was manually tagged with DISCUSS labels. These data were then used for three different tasks: utterance classification, dialogue move selection, and learning gains prediction.
System performance in these tasks demonstrate the utility and viability of the DISCUSS representation for analyzing and automating dialogue interactions. Utterance classifiers achieve DISCUSS labeling performance on par with inter-annotator agreement levels. System performance in ranking and selecting follow-up questions illustrates the usefulness of DISCUSS-based features for modeling and identifying the factors behind human decision making when teaching. Correlating features of the dialogue with measured learning gains in students shows how DISCUSS-derived metrics provide a detailed account of real tutoring strategies and student behaviors. Together these results represent a step toward more domain-independent mechanisms for modeling dialogue",multimedia,654,not included

However, to develop well defined software and hardware based criteria in the application of pattern recognition problems, is possible. The aim of classification can be defined as to assign an unknown object to a class containing similar objects (or to distinguish objects having the same properties from those not possessing). Classification is especially important in the real world applications or in the digital world. Basic classification methods using nearest neighbourhood algorithm have first been seen in early sixties under the subject tile"" pattern recognition.""Â  Classification is used in a huge variety of applications such as automatic target identification, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence, template matching, pattern recognition, analog to digital converters, quantization, medical diagnosis, statistics etc. Therefore nowadays, be it in the real or digital world, data classification is becoming increasingly important. But until recently, major work on classification was on developing algorithms used in software packages whereas, in many applications it is becoming more and more important to classify data much faster and in real time, entailing the need for hardware realization of these algorithms. Software approaches are not practical for real time applications, the processing is computationally very expensive, consuming a lot of Central Processing Unit (CPU) time when implemented as software running on general purpose computers. So in literature hardware implementation of classifier topologies become necessary. Also in literature hardware realized classifiers which are designed to work in low power operation; moreover some of these hardware classifiers do not have custom tunability. So they can only be used for a specific application. The recent developments in electronics technology has created a perfect medium for the hardware realization of classifier structures which, in turn, will render many classifier application prospects feasible in real time. This paper targets the design and application to real world problems of tunable, low power new classifier circuits using CMOS technology. So, a low-power CMOS implementation of a multi-input data classifier with several output levels is presented. The proposed circuit operates in current-mode and can classify several types of analog vector data. An architecture is developed comprising a threshold circuit based on CMOS transistors operating in subthreshold region. To this purpose a one dimensional classifier, called core circuit is proposed. The core circuit also works as a one-dimensional classifier. As this circuit is designed to operate in current-mode the input and the output data is provided to the core circuit with currents. So by interconnecting several core circuits and adding the output currents a multi output classifier can be obtained. Also, com-bining several core circuits in groups in such a way that each group has identical input current (different from the others), a multi-dimensional, multi-level output classifier can be obtained. Also, numerous efforts in balancing the trade off between power consumption, area and speed have resulted in an acceptable performance. On the other hand, the rapid increasing use of battery operated portable equipment in application areas such as telecommunications and medical electronics increases the importance of low-power and small sized VLSI circuits' technologies. One solution to achieve low-power and acceptable performance is to operate the transistors in the subthreshold region. The CMOS transistors working in subthreshold region are suitable only for specific applications which need, not very high performance, but low power consumption.The primary aim of this paper is to develop a low power classifier circuit with n inputs and externally tunable decision regions with different output amplitude for each region. Due to the subthreshold operation of the transistors in the proposed core circuit, very low power consumption becomes possible. The proposed core circuit is constructed with two threshold and a subtractor circuit. The SPICE simulation of the threshold circuit, core circuit, one dimensional and two dimensional classifier circuits are given. Using 0.35 Âµm parameters of AMS CMOS technology, SPICE simulations are performed and aÂ  low-power, custom tunable classifier circuit isÂ  realized. Because of the parallel processing characteristic of the circuit, it is well suited for real-world applications.Â Keywords: Classifier circuits, CMOS, current-mode, low-power",multimedia,656,not included

While it suffices to consider the propositional case for investigating general properties and the overall behavior of a semantics, we feel that for real applications and for computational purposes an implementation should be able to handle first-order programs without grounding them. In this paper we present a theoretical framework by defining a calculus of program transformations that apply directly to rules with variables and function symbols. Our main results are that (a) this calculus is weakly confluent for arbitrary programs (i.e., it has the normal form property), (b) it is weakly terminating for Datalog â¨,Â¬ programs, (c) for finite ground programs it is equivalent to a weakly terminating calculus introduced by Brass and Dix (S.Brass, J.Dix, in: J.Dix, L.Pereira, T.Przymusinski (Eds.), Non-monotonic Extensions of Logic Programming, Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Vol.927, Springer, Berlin, 1995, pp. 127â155), and (d) it approximates a generalization of Disjunctive Well-founded semantics (D-WFS) for arbitrary programs. We achieve this by transforming program rules into rules with equational constraints thereby using heavily methods and techniques from constraint logic programming (CLP). In particular, disconnection-methods play a crucial role. In principle, any constraint theory known from CLP can be exploited in the context of non-monotonic reasoning, not only equational constraints over the Herbrand domain. However, the respective constraint solver must be able to treat negative constraints of the considered constraint domain. In summary, this work yields the basis for a general combination of two paradigms: constraint logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning",multimedia,657,not included

The proposed model is aimed at solving prediction and inference problems. The implementation introduced in this work allows learning from data batches without the need of keeping them in memory afterwards. The learning architecture is built using Incremental Gaussian Mixture Models. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm and general geometric properties of Gaussian distributions are used to train the models.

However, one major challenge for graph processing systems is the irregular data access pattern of graph computation which can significantly degrade the performance. The algorithms, software, and hardware that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are, as a result, generally not effective for massive-scale sparse graphs from the real world due to their complexity and irregularity. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we combine the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) with a modern FPGA in order to achieve exceptional random access performance without any loss of flexibility or efficiency in computation. In particular, we develop collaborative software/hardware techniques to perform a level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on the FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that fully exploits the platform's capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. For each input graph, this algorithm provides an efficient data layout that allows the FPGA to coalesce memory requests into the largest possible HMC payload requests so that the number of memory requests, which is the primary factor in runtime, can be minimized. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by adding a merging unit. The merging unit takes the best advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluated the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications.

To demonstrate this potential, we implement the framework on multicore CPUs with multiple GPUs and compare the performance of two representative algorithms, blocked variants of matrix power and Lanczos methods. Our performance studies with large-scale graphs from real applications demonstrate that, when combined with communication-avoiding and thick-restarting techniques, the Lanczos method can be competitive with the power method, which is one of the most popular methods currently used for these applications. InIn addition, though we only focus on the truncated SVDs, the two computational kernels used in our studies, the sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiply and tall-skinny QR factorization, are fundamental building blocks for computing low-rank approximations with other objectives. Hence, our studies may have a greater impact beyond the truncated SVDs.",science,661,not included

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost.",science,667,not included

Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified into two categories: Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits their detection accuracy, and they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not scalable, and they cannot guarantee convergence. In this work, we propose SybilSCAR, a new structure-based method to perform Sybil detection in OSNs. SybilSCAR maintains the advantages of existing methods while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to label noises. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a (different) local rule to every user, which propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare SybilSCAR with a state-of-the-art RW-based method and a state-of-the-art LBP-based method, using both synthetic Sybils and large-scale social network datasets with real Sybils.

For this reason, a number of research have been done on using machine learning techniques to detect previously unseen phishing URLs. While they show promising results, any such implementation is yet to be seen. This is because 1) little work has been done on developing a complete end-to-end framework for phishing URL detection 2) it is prohibitively slow to detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms.

Our results indicated a 92% accuracy in classifying images originally labeled as chest X-ray or chest CT and a nearly 99% accurate classification of images containing medically relevant text. With larger training dataset and algorithmic tweaks, the accuracy can be further improved. Conclusion Applying DL on rich textual images and other metadata in tweets we can process and classify content for radiological significance in real time.",science,684,not included

This research responds to a question that belongs to the world of the social. How to communicate for a society that urgently needs to implement sustainability strategies in the fashion sector, based on artificial intelligence at the service of rescuing the human? In this sense, based on a projective documentary research and a series of in-depth interviews with fashion experts, it allowed us to initiate what aims to lay the foundations of a prosocial communication model in the fashion sector, based on the sustainability of the human being on the planet and, as a corollary, also based on artificial intelligence. The prosocial field is oriented to collaborate and help other people in a positive, productive and social way. Artificial intelligence in fashion, at the service of sustainability and communication, allows us to think with a humanistic approach to communication, where the focus is to understand the human being in a deep way, with an interrelation with artificial intelligence and the increase of sustainability in fashion in different areas of the value chain.

                  Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks for constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material point level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the networkâs architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to compute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In this way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their relation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the architecture of TANNs. Consequently, our approach does not have to identify the underlying pattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large data-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the predictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain thermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features, TANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling with neural networks.

Strain hardening and softening are also considered for the hyper-plastic scenario. Detailed comparisons show that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs. Finally, we demonstrate that the implementation of the laws of thermodynamics confers to TANNs high robustness in the presence of noise in the training data, compared to standard approaches.

An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture definition, reference implementation, and deployment. This provides the basis for further innovation of smart network services to accelerate scientific discovery in the era of big data, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.",science,703,included

The surface chemistry of the used QDs was amended with suitable capping ligands to obtain appropriate reactivity in terms of selectivity and sensitivity towards the target analytes. The implementation of PL-based sensing schemes combining multiple QDs of different nature, excited at the same wavelength and emitting at different ones, allowed to obtain a specific analyte-response profile. The first-order fluorescence data obtained from the whole emission spectra of the CdTe/AgInS2 combined nanoprobe upon interaction with folic acid and Fe(II) were processed by using chemometric tools, namely partial least-squares (PLS) and artificial neural network (ANN). This enabled to circumvent the selectivity issues commonly associated with the use of QDs prone to indiscriminate interaction with multiple species, which impair reliable and accurate quantification in complex matrices samples.
                  ANN demonstrated to be the most efficient chemometric model for the simultaneous determination of both analytes in binary mixtures and pharmaceutical formulations due to the non-linear relationship between analyte concentration and fluorescence data that it could handle. The R2

Especially in district heating, the stationarity of efficiency models, and thus the relevance of diagnostic classification system, cannot be ensured due to the impact of social, economic or technological changes, which are hard to identify or predict. Therefore, data mining and machine learning have become an attractive strategy for automatically and continuously absorbing such dynamics.
                  This paper presents a new method of evaluation and comparison of diagnostic information systems gathered algorithmically in district heating efficiency supervision based on exploring the evolution of information system and analyzing its dynamic features.
                  The process of data mining and knowledge discovery was applied to the data acquired from district heating substationsâ energy meters to provide the automated discovery of diagnostic knowledge base necessary for the efficiency supervision of district heating-supplied buildings. The implemented algorithm consists of several steps of processing the billing data, including preparation, segmentation, aggregation and knowledge discovery stage, where classes of abstract modelsrepresenting energy efficiency constitute an information system representing diagnostic knowledge about the energy efficiency of buildings favorably operatingunder similar climate conditions and supplied from the same district heating network.

This paradigm has been mostly addressed from a literary perspective, aiming at identifying the stylometric features and writeprints which unequivocally typify the writer patterns and allow their unique identification. On the other hand, the upsurge of social networking platforms and interactive messaging have undoubtedly made the anonymous expression of feelings, the sharing of experiences and social relationships much easier than in other traditional communication media. Unfortunately, the popularity of such communities and the virtual identification of their users deploy a rich substrate for cybercrimes against unsuspecting victims and other forms of illegal uses of social networks that call for the activity tracing of accounts. In the context of one-to-one communications this manuscript postulates the identification of the sender of a message as a useful approach to detect impersonation attacks in interactive communication scenarios. In particular this work proposes to select linguistic features extracted from messages via NLP techniques by means of a novel feature selection algorithm based on the dissociation between essential traits of the sender and receiver influences.

Most detection mechanisms attempt to classify user accounts as real (i.e., benign, honest) or fake (i.e., malicious, Sybil) by analyzing either user-level activities or graph-level structures. These mechanisms, however, are not robust against adversarial attacks in which fake accounts cloak their operation with patterns resembling real user behavior.
                  In this article, we show that victims â real accounts whose users have accepted friend requests sent by fakes â form a distinct classification category that is useful for designing robust detection mechanisms. In particular, we present Ãntegro â a robust and scalable defense system that leverages victim classification to rank most real accounts higher than fakes, so that OSN operators can take actions against low-ranking fake accounts. Ãntegro starts by identifying potential victims from user-level activities using supervised machine learning. After that, it annotates the graph by assigning lower weights to edges incident to potential victims. Finally, Ãntegro ranks user accounts based on the landing probability of a short random walk that starts from a known real account. As this walk is unlikely to traverse low-weight edges in a few steps and land on fakes, Ãntegro achieves the desired ranking.
                  We implemented Ãntegro using widely-used, open-source distributed computing platforms, where it scaled nearly linearly. We evaluated Ãntegro against SybilRank, which is the state-of-the-art in fake account detection, using real-world datasets and a large-scale deployment at Tuenti â the largest OSN in Spain with more than 15 million active users. We show that Ãntegro significantly outperforms SybilRank in user ranking quality, with the only requirement that the employed victim classifier is better than random. Moreover, the deployment of Ãntegro at Tuenti resulted in up to an order of magnitude higher precision in fake account detection, as compared to SybilRank.",science,713,not included

                  In the age of information superhighway, big data play a significant role in information processing, extractions, retrieving and management. In computational biology, the continuous challenge is to manage the biological data. Data mining techniques are sometimes imperfect for new space and time requirements. Thus, it is critical to process massive amounts of data to retrieve knowledge. The existing software and automated tools to handle big data sets are not sufficient. As a result, an expandable mining technique that enfolds the large storage and processing capability of distributed or parallel processing platforms is essential.
               
                  Method
                  In this analysis, a contemporary distributed clustering methodology for imbalance data reduction using k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classification approach has been introduced. The pivotal objective of this work is to illustrate real training data sets with reduced amount of elements or instances. These reduced amounts of data sets will ensure faster data classification and standard storage management with less sensitivity. However, general data reduction methods cannot manage very big data sets. To minimize these difficulties, a MapReduce-oriented framework is designed using various clusters of automated contents, comprising multiple algorithmic approaches.
               
                  Results
                  To test the proposed approach, a real DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) dataset that consists of 90 million pairs has been used. The proposed model reduces the imbalance data sets from large-scale data sets without loss of its accuracy.

As load changes throughout the day and the year, electricity systems must be able to deliver the maximum load at all times, which will be hard trade for a practical power network. Smart grid technologies show strong potential to optimize asset utilization by shifting peak load to off peak times, thereby decoupling the electricity growth from peak load growth. Under Smart grid trade regulation, with continuous varying demand pattern, electricity price will be uneven as well. On this view point, in order to obtain a flatten demand, without affecting the welfare of the market participants, this paper presents an on-going effort to develop Demand Response (DR) governed swarm intelligence based stochastic peak load modeling methodology capable of restoring the market equilibrium during price and demand oscillations of the real-time smart power networks. This proposed DR based methodology allows generators and loads to interact in an automated fashion in real time, coordinating demand to flatten spikes and thereby minimizing erratic variations of price of electricity. For proper utilization of DR connectivity, a Curtailment Limiting Index (CLI) has been formulated, monitoring which in real time, for each of the Load Dispatch Centers (LDCs), the system operator can shape the electricity demand according to the available capacity of generation, transmission and distribution assets. The proposed methodology can also be highlighted for generating the most economical schedule for social welfare with standard operational status in terms of voltage profile, system loss and optimal load curtailment. The case study has been carried out in IEEE 30 bus scenario as well as on a practical 203 bus-265 line power network (Indian Eastern Grid) with both generator characteristics and price responsive demand characteristics or DR as inputs and illustrious Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has assisted the fusion of the proposed model and methodology. Encouraging simulation results suggest that, the effective deployment of this methodology may lead to an operating condition where an overall benefit of all the power market participants with standard operational status can be ensured and the misuse of electricity will be minimized.",science,715,not included

To gain more insights on workflows we introduce a lightweight workflow monitoring infrastructure, WOW-MON (WOrkfloW MONitor), which enables user's access not only to cross-application performance data such as end-to-end latency and execution time of individual workflow components at runtime, but also to customized performance events. To reduce profiling overhead, WOW-MON uses adaptive selection of performance metrics based on machine learning algorithms to guide profilers collecting only metrics that have most impact on performance of workflows. Through the study of real scientific workflows (e.g., LAMMPS) with the help of WOWMON, we found that the performance of the workflows can be significantly affected by both software and hardware factors, such as the policy of process mapping and in-situ buffer size. Moreover, we experimentally show that WOWMON can reduce data movement for profiling by up to 54% without missing the key metrics for performance debugging.",science,716,not included

Its administration in humans seems to increase trust and reduce fear, in part by directly inhibiting the amygdala. However, the cerebral microcircuitry underlying this mechanism is still unknown. We propose the first biologically realistic model for trust, simulating spiking neurons in the cortex in a real-time humanârobot interaction simulation. At the physiological level, oxytocin cells were modeled with triple apical dendrites characteristic of their structure in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. As trust was established in the simulation, this architecture had a direct inhibitory effect on the amygdala tonic firing, which resulted in a willingness to exchange an object from the trustor (virtual neurorobot) to the trustee (human actor).

The main objective of this study is then to develop a general decision support system (DSS) framework to analyze the results of basic DEA models. The paper formally shows how the results of DEA models should be structured so that these solutions can be examined and interpreted by analysts through information visualization and data mining techniques effectively. An innovative and convenient DEA solver, SmartDEA, is designed and developed in accordance with the proposed analysis framework. The developed software provides DEA results which are consistent with the framework and are ready-to-analyze with data mining tools, thanks to their specially designed table-based structures. The developed framework is tested and applied in a real world project for benchmarking the vendors of a leading Turkish automotive company.

It allows a wide design space to be explored in order to discover novel bioprocess solutions. Currently, the high throughput experiments for bioprocess development are implemented in a sequential fashion in which liquid handling system will perform the web lab experiment to prepare the samples; standalone analysis devices detect the data such as protein concentration; and specific software is used to realise the data analysis for process design or further experimentation.
                  The aim of this paper is to show how the efficiency of the high throughput bioprocess development approach can be enhanced by creating an intelligent automation platform that systematically drives liquid handling system, analysis devices and data analysis to perform a closed-loop learning. The first generation prototype has been established which consists of three parts: automated devices, design algorithms and database. In order to prove the concept of prototype, both simulation and real experiments studies have been established. In this case study, the platform is used to investigate the solubility of lysozyme at various ion strengths and pH values. Tecan liquid handling system for experimentation as well as buffer preparation and a plate reader for uv absorption measurement to determine protein concentration were used as the automated devices. The simplex search algorithm and artificial neural network modelling were utilised as design algorithm to iteratively select the experiments to execute and determine the optimal design solution. An entity-relationship database with Tecan system configuration information and experimental data was established. The results demonstrate this integrated approach can implement experiments and data analysis automatically to provide specific bioprocess design solutions in a closed loop strategy at first time. It is a promising approach that may significant increase the level of lab automation to release the engineer from the labour intensive R&D activities and provides the base for sophisticated artificial intelligent learning in the future.",science,723,included

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects.publishersversionpublishe",science,724,not included

The knowledge of what is in front of the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or planning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class label and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to the robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for addressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the integration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often difficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several high-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and training. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this fragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the semantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the training of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and the intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real robotic platform. Thus, we do not propose a new CNN approach in this paper. Instead, we provide a stable and easy-to-use tool to make this technology more approachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at closing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics research. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment.

However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-learning to learn the shortest path on the building modelâs graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actorâcritic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces. Hence, our model achieves near optimal performance on the real world emergency environment.",robotics,747,included

In real-world applications, the need for a robot to interact in real time with multiple humans in a dynamic, 3-D environment presents a significant challenge. The recent availability of commercial color-depth cameras allow for the creation of a system that makes use of the depth dimension, thus enabling a robot to observe its environment and perceive in the 3-D space. Here we present a system for 3-D multiple human perception in real time from a moving robot equipped with a color-depth camera and a consumer-grade computer. Our approach reduces computation time to achieve real-time performance through a unique combination of new ideas and established techniques. We remove the ground and ceiling planes from the 3-D point cloud input to separate candidate point clusters. We introduce the novel information concept, depth of interest, which we use to identify candidates for detection, and that avoids the computationally expensive scanning-window methods of other approaches. We utilize a cascade of detectors to distinguish humans from objects, in which we make intelligent reuse of intermediary features in successive detectors to improve computation. Because of the high computational cost of some methods, we represent our candidate tracking algorithm with a decision directed acyclic graph, which allows us to use the most computationally intense techniques only where necessary. We detail the successful implementation of our novel approach on a mobile robot and examine its performance in scenarios with real-world challenges, including occlusion, robot motion, nonupright humans, humans leaving and reentering the field of view (i.e., the reidentification challenge), human-object and human-human interaction.

Using the vision system to preprocess the environment improves the agent's sample complexity and network update speed leading to significantly faster training with reduced image data loss.

The exploitation of an online learning algorithm empowers the fuzzy inference engine with the ability to modify its incomplete or possibly inconsistent knowledge base resulting in continuous improvement of the embedded knowledge. The fact that learning is an inherent feature of neural networks has inspired several researchers with the idea of using neural networks to implement fuzzy inference engines capable of learning. This paper presents a method for neural network FCM implementation of the fuzzy inference engine using the fuzzy columnar neural network architecture (FCNA).

The extra degrees of freedom can be used for avoiding obstacles or to optimize certain performance indices like manipulability or task compatibility. Maximizing manipulability keeps the manipulator away from singularities and provides more velocity transmission ratios in all directions. Optimizing task compatibility improves the force/velocity transmission ratios in the specified directions. However, the real time implementation of various optimizing algorithms is difficult because of the need of large computing time. In the present work, robot configurations for an optimum performance index are computed throughout the workspace. These configurations are then used to train a layered feed forward neural network (FFNN). During operation of the robot, the trained neural net outputs optimal configurations in real-time.

Object shape, which is our main cue for predicting grasps, is encoded with surface densities, that model the spatial distribution of points that belong to an object's surface. Grasp parameters are modeled with grasp densities, that correspond to the spatial distribution of object-relative gripper poses that lead to a grasp. The size and shape of grasp-predicting parts are identified by sampling the cross-object correlation of local shape and grasp parameters.

Those tasks can be either explicitly programmed by an engineer or learned by means of some automatic learning method, which improves the adaptability of the robot and reduces the effort of setting it up. In this sense, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self-adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(Î») (TOSL) with QBIASSR can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks. All of these are promising results towards the possibility of learning much more complex tasks autonomously by a robotic agent.",robotics,794,included

However, the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a fast low-level control strategy widely used in many control engineering tasks. Classic control theory has contributed with different tuning methods to obtain the gains of PID controllers for specific operation conditions. Nevertheless, when the system is not fully known and the operative conditions are variable and not previously known, classical techniques are not entirely suitable for the PID tuning. To overcome these drawbacks many adaptive approaches have been arisen, mainly from the field of artificial intelligent. In this work, we propose an incremental Q-learning strategy for adaptive PID control. In order to improve the learning efficiency we define a temporal memory into the learning process.

                  The physical distance between predator and prey is a primary determinant of behavior, yet few paradigms exist to study this reliably in rodents.
               
                  New method
                  The utility of a robotically controlled laser for use in a predatorâprey-like (PPL) paradigm was explored for use in rats. This involved the construction of a robotic two-dimensional gimbal to dynamically position a laser beam in a behavioral test chamber. Custom software was used to control the trajectory and final laser position in response to user input on a console. The software also detected the location of the laser beam and the rodent continuously so that the dynamics of the distance between them could be analyzed. When the animal or laser beam came within a fixed distance the animal would either be rewarded with electrical brain stimulation or shocked subcutaneously.
               
                  Results
                  Animals that received rewarding electrical brain stimulation could learn to chase the laser beam, while animals that received aversive subcutaneous shock learned to actively avoid the laser beam in the PPL paradigm. Mathematical computations are presented which describe the dynamic interaction of the laser and rodent.
               
                  Comparison with existing methods
                  The robotic laser offers a neutral stimulus to train rodents in an open field and is the first device to be versatile enough to assess distance between predator and prey in real time.
               
                  Conclusions

To tackle this problem, we propose a general CPG model emphasizing on its stability analysis, smooth transition and implementation architecture. Global exponential stability of the model is derived by using strict mathematical analysis. Transitions between different oscillating forms are also smooth, and the implementation architecture has low computational cost, thus suitable for microcontrollers. Moreover, all control parameters not only have clear relationships with the physical outputs, but also can be modified online.

Specifically, for miniature mobile robots with serious computational limitations, that are typical of embedded systems, one of the main challenges is the adaptation of efficient computational methods in order to find solutions of complex optimization problems, which demand large execution times. This drawback compels the design of high-performance parallel optimization algorithms which must run over embedded system platforms. This paper describes how adequate hardware implementations of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm can be useful for real time adaptation of mobile robot controllers. For achieving this, a new architecture is proposed, which is based on an FPGA implementation of the opposition-based learning (OBL) approach applied to the PSO (for short HPOPSO), and which explores the intrinsic parallelism of this algorithm in order to adjust the weights of a neural robot controller in real time according to desired behaviors. The proposed HPOPSO was applied to the learning-from-demonstration problem in which a teacher performs executions of the desired behavior. Effectiveness of the proposed architecture was demonstrated by numerical simulations and the feasibility of the adaptive behavior of the neural robot controller was confirmed for two obstacle avoidance case studies that were preserved when one or more failures on the distance sensors occur. The HPOPSO, which uses the OBL technique, improves the quality of the solutions in comparison with the standard PSO.

The information processed within different neural subsystems is neurocomputed using distributed and dynamic patterns of neural activity.

Studying how these patterns are elicited in the CNS under specific behavioral tasks has become a groundbreaking research topic in system neuroscience. This methodology of synthetic behavioral experimentation is also motivated by the concept of embodied neuroscience, according to which the primary goal of the CNS is to solve/facilitate the bodyâenvironment interaction.

However, these algorithms tend to require large amounts of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain on robots in the real world. We present an approach for efficiently learning goal-directed navigation policies on a mobile robot, from only a single coverage traversal of recorded data. The navigation agent learns an effective policy over a diverse action space in a large heterogeneous environment consisting of more than 2km of travel, through buildings and outdoor regions that collectively exhibit large variations in visual appearance, self-similarity, and connectivity. We compare pretrained visual encoders that enable precomputation of visual embeddings to achieve a throughput of tens of thousands of transitions per second at training time on a commodity desktop computer, allowing agents to learn from millions of trajectories of experience in a matter of hours. We propose multi- ple forms of computationally efficient stochastic augmentation to enable the learned policy to generalise beyond these precomputed embeddings, and demonstrate successful deployment of the learned policy on the real robot without fine tuning, despite environmental appearance differences at test time. The dataset and code required to reproduce these results and apply the technique to other datasets and robots is made publicly available at rl-navigation.github.io/deployable ",robotics,813,included

While the demand for these apaplications is growing, the performance benefits from general-purpose platforms is diminishing. This challenge has coincided with the explosion of data where the rate of data generation has reached an overwhelming level that is beyond the capabilities of current computing systems. Therefore, applications such as machine learning and robotics can benefit from hardware acceleration. Traditionally, to accelerate a set of workloads, we pro- file the code optimized for CPUs and offload the hot functions on hardware compute units designed specially for that particular function, hence providing higher performance and energy efficiency. Instead in this work, we take a revolutionary approach where we delve into the algorithmic properties of applications to define domain-generic hardware acceleration solutions. We leverage the property that a wide range of machine learning algorithms can be modeled as stochastic optimization problems. Using this insight we devise compute stacks for hardware acceleration that are built independent of the CPU. These stacks expose a high-level mathematical programming interface and automatically generate accelerators for users who have limited knowledge about hardware design, but can benefit from large performance and efficiency gains for their programs. 
Keeping these ambitious goals in mind, our work (1) strikes a balance between generality and specialization by breaking the long-held traditional abstraction of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) in favor of a more algorithm-centric approach; (2) develops hard- ware acceleration frameworks by co-designing a language, compiler, runtime system, and hardware to provide high performance and efficiency, in addition to flexibility and programmability; (3) segregates algorithmic specification from implementation to shield the programmer from continual hardware/software modifications while allowing them to benefit from the emerging heterogeneity of modern compute platforms; and (4) develops real cross-stack prototypes to evaluate these innovative solutions in a real-world setting and make them open-source to maximize community engagement and industry impact.

Among the various pre-processing steps of ML, Automatic Image Annotation (also known as automatic image tagging or linguistic indexing) is the process in which a computer system automatically assigns metadata in the form of captioning or keywords to a digital image. Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) methods (which have appeared during the last several years) make a large use of many ML approaches. Clustering and classification methods are most frequently applied to annotate images. In addition, these proposed solutions require a high computational infrastructure. However, certain real-time applications (small and ad-hoc intelligent applications) for example, autonomous small robots, gadgets, drone etc. have limited computational processing capacity. These small and ad-hoc applications demand a more dynamic and portable way to automatically annotate data and then perform ML tasks (Classification, clustering etc.) in real time using limited computational power and hardware resources. Through a comprehensive literature study we found that most image pre-processing algorithms and ML tasks are computationally intensive, and it can be challenging to run them on an embedded platform with acceptable frame rates. However, Raspberry Pi is sufficient for AIA and ML tasks that are relevant to small and ad-hoc intelligent applications. In addition, few critical intelligent applications (which require high computational resources, for example, Deep Learning using huge dataset) are only feasible to run on more powerful hardware resources. In this study, we present the framework of âAutomatic Image Annotation for Small and Ad-hoc Intelligent Application using Raspberry Piâ and propose the low-cost infrastructures (single node and multi node using Raspberry Pi) and software module (for Raspberry Pi) to perform AIA and ML tasks in real time for small and ad-hoc intelligent applications. The integration of both AIA and ML tasks in a single software module (with in Raspberry Pi) is challenging. This study will helpful towards the improvement in various practical applications areas relevant to small intelligent autonomous systems",robotics,815,included

systems is the tuning of the controller parameters. Typically, a model of the
system is used to obtain an initial controller, but ultimately the controller
parameters must be tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best
performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, methods from machine learning,
such as Bayesian optimization, have been used. However, as these methods
evaluate different controller parameters on the real system, safety-critical
system failures may happen. In this paper, we overcome this problem by
applying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm,
SafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an
initial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the
parameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying
performance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller
parameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high
probability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the
proposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller
parameters without human intervention.Comment: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2016. 6

Moreover,in modern human societies it is of great importance to build up machines thatcan be operated by non specialists or even by technologically illiterate people,such as youngsters or elderly. Therefore, the mobile robots to be released intothe market in the near future should possess, among others, the potential ofproducing meaningful internal perceptual representations of their own environment,capacitating them to cope a range of real-life situations and tasks. Tomake matters even more challenging, when it comes for mapping and navigation,robots should comprehend human concepts about places and objects,to skillfully deploy in human frequented environments. In response to thischallenge, intense research efforts, to build cognitive robots apt to competentlyperceive and understand their surroundings and to cooperate with humans,take place. With this goal in view, semantic mapping with mobile robots can constituteto a holistic solution in response to the aforementioned challenges. Thesemantic mapping is an augmented representation of the robotâs environmentthat -supplementary to the geometrical knowledge- encapsulates characteristicscompatible with human understanding. It provides several algorithmic opportunitiesfor innovative development of applications that will eventually lead tothe human robot interaction. The main objective of the PhD dissertation in handis the construction of accurate and consistent semantic maps facilitating amplerobot deployment in domestic environments.The motivation behind this PhD dissertation has been the observation thatthe plethora of the existing mapping and navigation algorithms are not ableto provide a sufficient representation of the environment in terms of humansâconcepts. This is due to the fact that the mapping methods developed sofar focus on the construction of geometrical maps. Although some of thesesolutions proved to be capable of driving robots into specific target positions,they lack of high level cognition attributes, which would allow them to bring the human-robot interaction one step beyond. Aiming to remove this barrier, thisdissertation is oriented towards the direction of developing semantic mappingalgorithms for high level robot navigation. Therefore, this doctoral researchidentified the basic components of the semantic mapping and developed aninnovative solution for each one of them. Due to the fact that the semanticmapping requires an integrated system that comprises several subordinatemodules, a wide range of a algorithms that serve different tasks had to bedesigned and implemented. Within the context of this thesis several algorithmicmodules have been developed including a competent localization algorithm,novel simultaneously localization and mapping strategies, breakthrough place andobject recognition tactics, as well as the integration of all these methods undera time supervised framework able to produce consistent semantic maps. Dueto the fact that each subordinate module comprises an innovative solutionto the respective field, the resulting semantic mapping system constitutesa state of the art solution in the area of conceptual mapping with mobilerobots. The introduced algorithms exploit solely visual and depth sensors,while by combining basic tools from three different scientific areas such asrobotics, computer vision and machine learning the final objective is accomplished.Overall, the main contribution of this thesis to the advancement the stateof the art is the introduction of a stacked map hierarchy of four differenttype of maps, namely a metric, a topological, a labeled sparse topological andan augmented navigation one. Each of these representations accomplishes aunique purpose: (i) the metric is the physical (lower) layer; (ii) the topologicalone contains abstract geometrical information of the environment, i.e. pointclouds registered in a graph of nodes; (iii) the labeled sparse topological oneestablishes the spatiotemporal coherence by associating the respective nodes inthe topometric maps via place labels and geometrical transformations, enablingbidirectional exchange of information among the conceptual and metric mapsand, last, (iv) the augmented navigation map inheres the significance of thedetected places as well as their connectivity relationships, expressed in termsof their transition probability.The thesis in hand has been developed in a hierarchical fashion and can bedivided into four main chapters. The first one comprises a literature survey ofthe existing semantic mapping methods in which an explicit analysis of the sofar developed methods is sought. The insights of the semantic mapping arereviewed, the distinct components encompassing, to give a categorization of therelated literature, are studied the possible applications in mobile robotics areexamined and, lastly, the methods and databases available for benchmarkingare referred. Furthermore, a quality-based taxonomy of the existing semanticmapping methods highlights the dominant attributes such methods retain.More precisely, according to the scale, to which each method is expanded, the metric map could be either a single scene or a progressively created map.Another important attribute a typical semantic mapping method possessesis the existence of the respective topological map, that is an abstraction ofthe explored environment in terms of a graph. The nodes of such a graph areorganized in a geometrical manner, so as to simultaneously preserve conceptualknowledge about the explored places. Moreover, the modalities (single ormultiple visual cues) utilized to reason about the observed scene constitute anelement apt to distinguish the abundance of different methods. An additionalfeature in many recent semantic mapping techniques is the temporal coherencesuch a map reveals, which renders it useful for high-level activities, viz. taskplanning or human robot interaction.The second chapter refers to the description of the developed technologicalbackground required to build a consistent semantic map. Therefore, a majorcontribution of the first part is the development of an innovative visual odometryalgorithm able to operate in real time. This algorithm receives as input successivestereo pair of images from a stereoscopic camera mounted on a mobilerobot. It involves the detection of the salient landmarks between successiveimages. A depth estimation of these features is then obtained and a novelnon-iterative outlier detection and discarding methodology able to remove boththe mismatches between the features and the inserted errors due to the 3Dreconstruction procedure. A hierarchical motion estimation technique, whichproduces robust estimations for the movement of the robot is then adopted,thus providing refinements to the robotâs global position and orientation. Anadditional 3D reconstruction algorithm that operates on stereo images hasbeen developed providing accurate reconstruction of the area observed bythe robot. Moreover, the localization algorithm comprises the cornerstone forthe development of a simultaneously localization and mapping system suitablefor the 3D geometrical mapping of the explored environment. This 3D metricmapping system is based solely on an RGB-D sensor, where in course of robotâslocomotion 3D point clouds are merged with respect to the visual odometry.The resulted 3D map is refined by exploiting a random sample consensus planedetection algorithm accompanied by an iterative closest point registration step,among the dominant planes of the consecutive time instances, resulting thusin a very consistent geometrical 3D map. All the aforementioned developedalgorithms have been evaluated on a custom made robot platform bearing twostereoscopic cameras with different baselines and a RGB-D sensor.The third chapter encloses all the semantic mapping methods based onvisual cues that have been developed within this PhD dissertation. The firstone examines the overall traversability of the observed scene taking into considerationthe robotâs embodiment. This knowledge constitutes a cornerstone forthe autonomous robot navigation. The developed system utilizes an algorithm to retrieve specific characteristics of the environment using a stereo cameraand to produce a disparity map of the scene. Then, the v-disparity image iscalculated based on the disparity map. The v-disparity is then exploited by afeature extraction procedure to provide the system with respective conceptualvectors, which are used to train support vector machines in order to assess theoverall traversability of the scene. The traversable classified scenes are furtherprocessed and the likelihood distribution of the collision risk assessment, whenthe robot moves towards any direction, is calculated. The second part involvesthe description of a novel object recognition algorithm based on hierarchical temporalmemory networks. This constitutes a supervised learning method usedto recognize objects in different orientations. It introduces specific alternativerules for the design of each building block of a hierarchical temporal memorynetwork. These rules expand both the spatial and the temporal module ofthe network. Various type of input layers have been tested such as logppolarand saliency detection ones in order to find the solution that fits better in applicationsthat concern cluttered environments. The third part of this chaptercomprises the description of an innovative place classification algorithm. Withinthis work, in course of robotâs locomotion, salient visual features are detectedand they shape a bag-of-features problem, quantized by a neural gas to codethe spatial information for each scene. Each input image is transformed intoan appearance based histogram representation that abstracts the place in avery compatible and consistent manner. The learning procedure is performedby support vector machines able to accurately recognize multiple dissimilarplaces. The innovative appearance based algorithm produces semantic inferencessuitable for labeling unexplored environments. In the rest of this chaptera long range semantic mapping framework is described, where geometricalmapping, with place and object recognition is combined in order to construct ahuman oriented semasiological map. This framework features geometrical andsemasiological attributes capable to reveal relationships between objects andplaces in a real-life environment. The geometrical component consists of a 3Dmap, onto which a topological map is deployed, representing the explored areaas a graph of nodes. The semasiological part is realized by putting together aplace recognition algorithm and an object recognition one. The categorizationof the different places relies on the resolution of appearance-based consistencyhistograms, while for the recognition of objects in the scene we make use of thehierarchical temporal memory network boosted by a saliency attentional model.These semantical attributes are then deposited on each node of the topologicalmap, in order to augment it with the belief distributions regarding the visitedplaces, thus resulting in a 3D object map embodying geometrical and semanticalproperties.Finally, in the fourth chapter of this thesis a novel semantic mapping method suitable for robot navigation in a human compatible manner is illustrated. Themain objective of this chapter is to take into account the time proximity of therobot acquired frames within the semantic map. The goal of this method is; (i)to introduce a semasiological mapping method for robot exploration and (ii) tomake use of the constructed semantic map as a means to provide a hierarchicalnavigation solution. The semantic map is formed during the robotâs course,relying on the memorization of abstract place representations. It integrates thespace quantization, the time proximity of the acquired frames and the spatialcoherence in terms of a novel labeled sparse topological map. A time evolvingaugmented navigation graph is shaped determining the semantic topology ofthe explored environment and the physical connectivity among the recognizedplaces expressed by the inter-place transition probability. Concerning therobot navigation part, a human-robot interaction methodology is illustratedcapable of competently addressing go-to commands. As a product of thismodule, an augmented navigation graph is formed, which handles the high levelrobot navigation, forwarding the presumable sequence of places the robotshould traverse to reach its target location. Accordingly, for the low levellocal navigation the topometric data of the semantic map are made use of.Additionally, to assist the human robot interaction a graphical user interfacehas been developed providing an overall supervision of the mapping andnavigation procedure.The last chapter of this dissertation concludes the doctoral research conductedhereby. It discusses the achievements of this work, while it also highlightsthe open issues and the questions revealed during the developmentof the several algorithmic solutions.

Robotics-assisted tilt table technology was introduced for early rehabilitation of neurological patients. It provides cyclical stepping movement and physiological loading of the legs. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility of this type of device for peak cardiopulmonary performance testing using able-bodied subjects.

METHODS:

A robotics-assisted tilt table was augmented with force sensors in the thigh cuffs and a work rate estimation algorithm. A custom visual feedback system was employed to guide the subjects' work rate and to provide real time feedback of actual work rate. Feasibility assessment focused on: (i) implementation (technical feasibility), and (ii) responsiveness (was there a measurable, high-level cardiopulmonary reaction?). For responsiveness testing, each subject carried out an incremental exercise test to the limit of functional capacity with a work rate increment of 5 W/min in female subjects and 8 W/min in males.

RESULTS:

11 able-bodied subjects were included (9 male, 2 female; age 29.6 Â± 7.1 years: mean Â± SD). Resting oxygen uptake (O_{2}) was 4.6 Â± 0.7 mL/min/kg and O_{2}peak was 32.4 Â± 5.1 mL/min/kg; this mean O_{2}peak was 81.1% of the predicted peak value for cycle ergometry. Peak heart rate (HRpeak) was 177.5 Â± 9.7 beats/min; all subjects reached at least 85% of their predicted HRpeak value. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at O_{2}peak was 1.02 Â± 0.07. Peak work rate) was 61.3 Â± 15.1 W. All subjects reported a Borg CR10 value for exertion and leg fatigue of 7 or more.

CONCLUSIONS:

The robotics-assisted tilt table is deemed feasible for peak cardiopulmonary performance testing: the approach was found to be technically implementable and substantial cardiopulmonary responses were observed. Further testing in neurologically-impaired subjects is warranted",robotics,818,included

Robots have the potential to solve many problems in society, because of their ability to work in dangerous places doing necessary jobs that no one wants or is able to do. One barrier to their widespread deployment is that they are mainly limited to tasks where it is possible to hand-program behaviors for every situation that may be encountered. For robots to meet their potential, they need methods that enable them to learn and adapt to novel situations that they were not programmed for. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making processes and could solve the problems of learning and adaptation on robots. This book identifies four key challenges that must be addressed for an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks. These RL for Robotics Challenges are: 1) it must learn in very few samples; 2) it must learn in domains with continuous state features; 3) it must handle sensor and/or actuator delays; and 4) it should continually select actions in real time. This book focuses on addressing all four of these challenges. In particular, this book is focused on time-constrained domains where the first challenge is critically important. In these domains, the agentâs lifetime is not long enough for it to explore the domains thoroughly, and it must learn in very few samples",robotics,819,not included

Key challenges to the widespread deployment of robots include the ability to learn models of environmental features based on sensory inputs, bootstrap off of the learned models to detect and adapt to environmental changes, and autonomously tailor the sensory processing to the task at hand. This paper summarizes a comprehensive effort towards such bootstrap learning, adaptation, and processing management using visual input.

Deep Neural Networks (DNN's) have come up as state of art for various machine intelligence applications such as object detection, image classification, face recognition and performs myriad of activities with exceptional prediction accuracy. AI in this contemporary world is moving towards embedded platforms for inference on the edge. This is essential to avoid latency, enhance data security and realize real-time performance. However, these DNN algorithms are computational and memory intensive. Consequently, exploiting immense energy, compute resources and memory-bandwidth making it difficult to be deployed in embedded devices. To solve this problem and realize an on-device AI acceleration, dedicated energy-efficient hardware accelerators are paramount. This thesis involves the implementation of such a dedicated deep learning accelerator on the FPGA. The NVIDIA's Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA), is encompassed in this research to explore SoC designs for integrated inference acceleration. NVDLA, an open-source architecture, standardizes deep learning inference acceleration on hardware. It optimizes inference acceleration all across the full stack from application through hardware to achieve energy efficiency synergy with the demanding throughput requirements. Therefore, the following thesis probes into the NVDLA framework to perceive the consistent workflow across the whole hardware-software programming hierarchies. Besides, the hardware design parameters, optimization features and system configurations of the NVDLA systems are analyzed for efficient implementations. Also, a comparative study of the diverse NVDLA SoC implementations (nv\_small and nv\_medium) with respect to performance metrics such as power, area, and throughput are discussed. Our approach engages prototyping of Nvidiaâs Deep Learning Accelerator on a Zynq Ultrascale+ ZCU104 FPGA to examine its system functionality. The Hardware design of the system is carried out using Xilinx's Vivado Design Suite 2018.3 in Verilog. While the on-device software runs Linux kernel 4.14 on Zynq MPSoC. Thus, the software ecosystem is built with PetaLinux tools from Xilinx. The entire system architecture is validated using the pre-built regression tests that verify individual CNN layers. Besides these NVDLA hardware design also runs pre-compiled AlexNet as a benchmark for performance evaluation and comparisonToday, Artificial Intelligence is at the edge. This edge or endpoint device is becoming more sophisticated with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. For instance, these devices are employed in different applications such as autonomous cars, drones, and other IoT gadgets. At present, a self-driving car is a data center on wheels, a drone is a data center on wings as well as robots are data centers with arms and legs. All these mechanisms collect vast real-world information that demands to be processed in real-time. Here in these applications, there is no time to send data to the cloud for processing and wait for action. As the decision making needs to be instantaneous. There is a shift in transforming the processing to the edge devices. The edge acceleration brings computation and data storage closer to the device. With the evolution of specialized hardwareâs providing increased computational capabilities, the AI models are processed on the edge. As a result, the overall system latency gets reduced, the bandwidth costs for data transfers are lowered and the data processing is done locally enhances privacy concerns. For example, autonomous cars require a spontaneous reaction (in seconds) to avoid potential hazards on the road. Consider the situation where a self-driving car is collecting real word information like images, videos, in this case, assume itâs sensing for a stop sign. If the system sends the specific image information to the cloud for processing and waits for a decision to stop. By that response time, the autonomous vehicle could have already blown through the stop sign running over several people. Therefore, it is paramount to process the data in real-time which could be accomplished using dedicated hardware for processing locally.

In view of scientific challenges for developing innovative solutions with a broad social impact, it investigates applications in biomedicine and computer-assisted navigation of visually impaired individuals. In this context, it focuses on machine learning, particularly the investigation of methods to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of deep artificial neural network architectures, such as the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) the input data can contain uncertainties, such as noise, color and geometric ubiquities, that is naturally propagated from the input layer to the convolution layers of the network affecting the quality of the extracted features. To cope with this problem, a novel pooling operation based on (type-1) fuzzy sets is proposed, named Fuzzy Pooling, which can be used as a drop-in replacement of the current, crisp, pooling layers of CNN architectures. Several experiments using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach can enhance the classification performance of a CNN.Aiming to improve the effectiveness of CNNs, especially in the context of medical image analysis, a novel architecture named Look Behind Fully Convolutional Neural Network (LB-FCN) is proposed. The architecture is capable of extracting multi-scale image features by using blocks of parallel convolutional layers with different filter sizes. These blocks are connected by look-behind connections, so that the features they produce are combined with features extracted from behind layers, thus preserving the respective information. Furthermore, it has a smaller number of free parameters than conventional CNN architectures, which makes it suitable for training with smaller datasets. This is particularly useful in medical image analysis, since data availability is usually limited, due to ethicolegal constraints. Experiments on publicly available gastrointestinal image datasets show higher classification performance compared to state-of-the-art machine and deep learning methodologies. The architecture is capable of generalizing well even when the training dataset is different than the one on which it is tested. To investigate that, a novel cross-dataset experimental study was performed on various publicly available gastrointestinal tract image datasets, containing images from different modalities, including Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) and flexible endoscopy. The number of training samples in CNN training is directly linked to their generalization performance. When the training samples are limited, such as in the case of medical images, the generalization performance is negatively affected. A typical approach to mediate this problem is to use data augmentation techniques, which image rotation and translation. While effective, this technique still requires a substantial amount of training samples to be available. To battle this problem, in the context of inflammatory conditions detection in WCE images, a novel approach is presented that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artificial images. More specifically the study trained two GANs, one to generate healthy small bowel images and another, images with inflammatory conditions. The images are then used to train a CNN architecture and validate its performance in real images. The results from this study show that the substitution of real with artificially generated endoscopic images for CNN training can be a viable option.While CNNs have a remarkable performance in computer vision problems, usually, they are computationally expensive. This limits their usage in high-end expensive devices with multiple graphical processing units (GPUs). To mediate the problem, a typical approach is to reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for inference, at the expense of generalization performance. In this context, a novel LB-FCN inspired CNN architecture was proposed, named LB-FCN light. The architecture features a relatively low number of free parameters and FLOPs, while managing to maintain high generalization performance. The performance of the network is validated in the problem of staircase detection in indoor and outdoor environments, with application on assisted navigation of visually impaired individuals. The results from the experimental evaluation of LB-FCN light indicate its advantageous performance over the relevant state-of-the-art architectures.The development of easy-to-use machine learning (ML) application frameworks has enabled the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications with only a few lines of self-explanatory code. However, the deployment of ML algorithms as a service for remote high throughput ML task execution, involving complex data-processing pipelines can still be challenging, especially with respect to production ML use cases. To cope with this issue, a novel system architecture is presented, which enables Algorithm-agnostic, Scalable ML (ASML) task execution for high throughput applications. It aims to provide an answer to the research question of how to design and implement an abstraction framework, suitable for the deployment of end-to-end ML pipelines in a generic and standard way. The architecture manages horizontal scaling, task scheduling, reporting, monitoring and execution of multi-client ML tasks using modular, extensible components that abstract the execution details of the underlying algorithms. Applications of ASML are investigated for the analysis of image streams in the context of medical image analysis and assisted navigation of visually impaired individuals. The results of the experiments performed demonstrate its capacity for parallel, mission critical, task execution. Assistive navigation systems require the development, assessment, and optimization of different algorithms for obstacle detection, recognition, and avoidance, as well as path planning. This is a painstaking and costly process that requires repetitive measurements under stable conditions, which is usually difficult to achieve. To this end, a novel digital twin framework for the simulation and evaluation of assistive navigation systems is presented. The framework can replicate relevant real-life situations, enabling the evaluation and optimization of algorithms through adjustable and cost-effective simulations. The utility and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated with an indicative simulation study in the context of a camera-based wearable system for the navigation of visually impaired individuals in an outdoor cultural space.The work presented in this dissertation includes methods with both theoretical and practical impact, that can be used as the basis for further research, and the applications presented can be used as paradigms for applications on different domains, such as telemedicine, robotics, and intelligent transportation systems.Î ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ± Î´Î¹Î´Î±ÎºÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® Î´Î¹Î±ÏÏÎ¹Î²Î® Î´Î¹ÎµÏÎµÏÎ½Î¬ ÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÏÎ± Î­Î¾ÏÏÎ½Î± ÏÏÏÏÎ®Î¼Î±ÏÎ± ÎºÎ±Î¹ ÏÏÎ·ÏÎµÏÎ¯ÎµÏ Î±Î½Î¬Î»ÏÏÎ·Ï ÎµÎ¹ÎºÏÎ½Î±Ï ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î²Î¯Î½ÏÎµÎ¿.

Older adultsâ desire of staying healthy, staying at their own home consists an important motive for the development of assistive technologies that will realize it through remote monitoring technologies. Proliferation of low-cost, off-the-shelf IoT devices has led to the implementation of the so called smart homes projects, which are solutions that are mixing the older adultsâ physical spaces with monitoring and computing capabilities, allowing the collection of high-frequency daily life data. Methods: This stydy consist of two parts. An experimental one that takes place in a lab space and a real life application of sensor monitoring technology. In particular, an ecologically valid space was created within the Thessaloniki Active & Healthy Ageing Living, where fifteen (15) older adults participated in the pilot testing of the technology. Participants visited the ecologically valid space for almost two weeks, covering eight (8) 1 hour-sessions in total. There, they followed a protocol of typical daily life activities, where several unobtrusive scenario of monitoring were interweaved. No restrictions were imposed with respect to the execution of tasks, thus making sure that the data collection follows an ecologically valid paradigm. Subsequently, senor data collected from 10 participants were statistically correlated to clinical assessment tools. Then, a series of focus groups openly discussing about technology and obtrusiveness were carried out with thirteen participants. Moving to the second part of the study, some adjustments with respect to the technology had to be considered according to the Living Lab study findings. Favorable technology was installed to 5 older womensâ homes for more than a year time resulting to hundreds of thousands data points to be collected. Different modeling techniques were employed, such as statistical modeling, and machine learning, in order to explore clinical added value of digital biomarkers. As an application scenario, the study of modelling emotional disturbances and in particular the one of geriatric depression was carried out. In addition, a longitudinal study about sensor monitoring unobtrusiveness was conducted to examine end-user acceptance. A follow-up interview was carried out with each one of the participants. Finally, we explore the possibility of mapping the results of the data-driven modelling approaches with expert-driven models and knowledge representation schemata, such as the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) in a way that is transparent to the clinicians. Results: With respect to the first part of the study quite a few statistical significant correlations between sensor data and clinical tools were found, e.g. mobility and affective characteristics linked to emotional health and quality of life. With respect to the results of the focus groups these were transcribed and analysed with qualitative methods in order to extract the most significant themes and to categorize them to one of the obtrusiveness framework axes. For the second part o fthe study, a generalized linear mixed prediction model of PHQ-9 was developed utilizing information about TV usage patterns. Random Forests achieved mean accuracy score >80% when given to classify between healthy and depressive cases, while another RF classifier achieved an AUC>90% when having to deal with all sorts of depressive synptoms severity (from mild to severe). The initial FCM model also achieved a high classification rate up to 96% given some synthetic cases provided by experts. Finally, older adultsâ longitudinal attitudes revealed a negative stance towards the use of the mirror camera and the smart watch, as well as the Kinect device. The answers to the questionnaire of the lady that left the study at month 12, were compared against the mean value of the rest four particpants to check for any particular reasons of her decision. Significant differences from the mean value of the rest four were found for the Kinect device, the smart watch and the mirror camera.

,to_check,core,,2020-01-01 00:00:00,core,'now publishers',,"Climate econometrics is a new sub-discipline that has grown rapidly over the last few years. As greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are a major cause of climate change, and are generated by human activity, it is not surprising that the tool set designed to empirically investigate economic outcomes should be applicable to studying many empirical aspects of climate change.

Economic and climate time series exhibit many commonalities. Both data are subject to non-stationarities in the form of evolving stochastic trends and sudden distributional shifts. Consequently, the well-developed machinery for modeling economic time series can be fruitfully applied to climate data. In both disciplines, we have imperfect and incomplete knowledge of the processes actually generating the data. As we donât know that data generating process (DGP), we must search for what we hope is a close approximation to it. The data modeling approach adopted at Climate Econometrics (http://www.climateeconometrics.org/) is based on a model selection methodology that has excellent properties for locating an unknown DGP nested within a large set of possible explanations, including dynamics, outliers, shifts, and non-linearities. The software we use is a variant of machine learning which implements multi-path block searches commencing from very general specifications to discover a well-specified and undominated model of the processes under analysis. To do so requires implementing indicator saturation estimators designed to match the problem faced, such as impulse indicators for outliers, step indicators for location shifts, trend indicators for trend breaks, multiplicative indicators for parameter changes, and indicators specifically designed for more complex phenomena that have a common reaction âshapeâ like the impacts of volcanic eruptions on temperature reconstructions. We also use combinations of these, inevitably entailing settings with more candidate variables than observations.

Having described these econometric tools, we take a brief excursion into climate science to provide the background to the later applications. By noting the Earthâs available atmosphere and water resources, we establish that humanity really can alter the climate, and is doing so in myriad ways. Then we relate past climate changes to the âgreat extinctionsâ seen in the geological record. Following the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, building on earlier advances in scientific, technological and medical knowledge, real income levels per capita have risen dramatically globally, many killer diseases have been tamed, and human longevity has approximately doubled. However, such beneficial developments have led to a global explosion in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. These are also subject to many relatively sudden shifts from major wars, crises, resource discoveries, technology and policy interventions. Consequently, stochastic trends, large shifts and numerous outliers must all be handled in practice to develop viable empirical models of climate phenomena. Additional advantages of our econometric methods for doing so are detecting the impacts of important policy interventions as well as improved forecasts. The econometric approach we outline can handle all these jointly, which is essential to accurately characterize non-stationary observational data. Few approaches in either climate or economic modeling consider all such effects jointly, but a failure to do so leads to mis-specified models and hence incorrect theory evaluation and policy analyses. We discuss the hazards of modeling wide-sense non-stationary data (namely data not just with stochastic trends but also distributional shifts), which also serves to describe our notation.

The application of the methods is illustrated by two detailed modeling exercises. The first investigates the causal role of CO2 in Ice Ages, where a simultaneous-equations system is developed to characterize land ice volume, temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels as non-linear functions of measures of the Earthâs orbital path round the Sun. The second turns to analyze the United Kingdomâs highly non-stationary annual CO2 emissions over the last 150 years, walking through all the key modeling stages. As the first country into the Industrial Revolution, the UK is one of the first countries out, with per capita annual CO2 emissions now below 1860âs levels when our data series begin, a reduction achieved with little aggregate cost. However, very large decreases in all greenhouse gas emissions are still required to meet the UKâs 2050 target set by its Climate Change Act in 2008 of an 80% reduction from 1970 levels, since reduced to a net zero target by that date, as required globally to stabilize temperatures. The rapidly decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies offer hope of further rapid emission reductions in that area, illustrated by a dynamic scenario analysis",health,832,not included
,to_check,core,,2020-08-28 00:00:00,core,'victoria university of wellington library',,"Robots are entering our daily lives from self-driving cars to health-care robots. Historically, pre-programmed robots were vulnerable to changing conditions in daily life, primarily because of a lack of ability to generate novel, non-preset flexible solutions. Thus there is a need for robotics to incorporate adaptation, which is a trait of higher order natural species. This adaptation allows higher-order natural species to change their behaviours and internal mechanisms based on experience with often dynamic environment. The ability to adapt emerged through evolutionary processes.
Evolutionary Robotics is an approach to create autonomous robots that are capable of automatically generating artificial behaviors and morphologies to achieve adaptation. Evolutionary robotics has the potential to automatically synthesize controllers for real autonomous robots and generate solutions to complete tasks in the uncertain real-world. Compared to the inflexibility of pre-programmed robots, evolutionary robots are able to learn flexible solutions to given tasks through evolutionary methods.

Cognitive robotics, a branch of artificial cognitive systems research, is such an attempt to create autonomous robots by applying bio-inspired methods. As the robot interacts with environment, an underlying cognitive system can learn its own solutions toward task completion. This learning-solution-from-interaction approach, also termed as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, is widely applied in cognitive robotics to learn the solutions automatically. Ideally, the solutions can emerge in the cognitive system through the trial-and-error process of the RL approach without introducing human bias.

This thesis aims to develop an evolutionary cognitive architecture (system) for a robot that can learn adaptive solutions to complete tasks. Inspired by emotion theories, this work proposes Affective Computing Multilayer Cognitive Architecture (ACMCA), a universal cognitive architecture, which is able to learn diverse solutions. Extending from previous work, ACMCA has a five-layer structure, where each layer aims to achieve different components of the solutions. The position of this thesis is that introducing a novel emotion inspired multilayer architecture that produces task solutions through subsumption operations and underlying appropriate machine learning algorithms will allow a robot to complete admissible tasks.

ACMCAâs five layers are: primary reinforcer layer, secondary reinforcer layer, core affect state layer, strategy layer, and behaviour layer. This five-layer decomposition also meets the traditional decomposition of a mobile control system into functional modules (e.g. perception, modelling, planning, task execution, and motor control). Each layer contains computing nodes as functional modules that process various Stimuli, Actions, and their consequential Outcomes of the cognitive system. In this work, 17 computing nodes and their connections in ACMCA represent the solutions that a mobile robot has learned to complete navigation tasks in complex scenarios.

Inspired by the Constructive Theory 1 and the robotic subsumption system, this work proposes a contingency-based subsumption approach to construct ACMCA. This contingency is termed Stimuli-Action-Outcome Contingency (SAOC), which is extended from the Action-Outcome (AO) contingency of Construction Theory. SAOCs are represented by âif-thenâ rules, termed SAOC rules, which encapsulate Stimuli, Actions, and their consequential Outcomes, providing clear symbolic interpretations. That is, the symbolic meaning of a SAOC rule can be interpreted as: if the input stimulus is perceived, the output action will be advocated as a cognitive response, expecting the outcome of the action with an estimation of relevance. As low-level computing nodes encapsulate Stimulus, Actions, and Outcomes, high-level computing nodes can subsume these low-level ones through the form of SAOC rules. Therefore, the proposed ACMCA can be constructed by subsumption layers of Stimuli-Action-Outcome Contingency (SAOC) rules.

This work applies machine learning techniques to facilitate ACMCAâs real-world robotic implementation. This work selects Accuracy-based Learning Classifier Systems (XCS) algorithms as the underlying machine learning techniques that are deployed at computing nodes for the contingency-based subsumption operations. The mitosis approach of XCS and the XCS with a Combined Reward method (XCSCR) are two novel variants of XCS algorithm. They are proposed to amend two challenges that occur when the standard XCS approaches are applied for robotic applications. The mitosis approach introduces an accuracy pressure into the algorithmâs evolutionary process, improving the algorithmsâ performance in robotic applications where noisy interferences exist. The XCSCR enables the policy to emerge earlier and more frequently than the existing benchmark approaches in multistep problems. Therefore, a robot with the XCSCR can handle a multistep scenario more effectively than those with the benchmarked algorithms.

This work conducts five experiments to test the capability of ACMCA and its underlying algorithms in learning solutions for robotic navigation tasks. The five experiments are conducted as follows: reflex-learning, IR-tuning, deliberation-establishing, emotion model, and combined reward assignment. As the results of the experiments, three different affective patterns have emerged in the first three experiments, an emotion model has emerged in the fourth experiments, and the fifth experiment explores ACMCAâs potential implementation in the life-long learning scenario.

These results demonstrate that ACMCA, a novel emotion inspired multilayer architecture, can produce task solutions through contingency-based subsumption operations and underlying appropriate machine learning algorithms, allowing a robot to complete admissible tasks through evolutionary processes. The contingency-based subsumption operations can establish three contingencies and one emotion model between the subsumed components by multiple RL agents which deploy the proposed mitosis approach of XCS algorithms. These three emotion patterns and emotion model can consistently improve the robotâs navigation performance with interpretable explanations. These two variants of XCS algorithms can amend shortfalls of the standard XCS approach in real-world robotic implementations. It has been demonstrated that the diverse solutions learned by ACMCA improve the navigation performance of the robot in terms of higher flexibility, reduction in continuous collisions and shorter navigation time consumption",health,833,not included

This disease is classified in five progressive stages (1>2>3>4>5), and it is shocking to know that 70% of the patients that start Kidney Replacement Therapy (KRT), only in the last stage, do not know they were previously infected by it. It is clear that those patients in the early stages of CKD are underdiagnosed and deprived of health policies to optimize diagnosis and to warn them of the need for KRT and of the catastrophic cardiovascular outcomes that are the main cause of death in this segment. The barriers identified for kidney care were the factors related to the knowledge and attitude of physicians and patients, besides the geography. In this context, there is a need to develop well-designed strategies to guide decision-making and enhance the care for patients with CKD. In this, work, we aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence tool called ontology, with a view to optimizing the early diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Health Care. For this purpose, after acquiring knowledge about the disease domain, we drew up the global guideline for the assistance of the patient with kidney disease in the form of a Rule-Based System that was subsequently implemented manually following the model 101 for construction of ontologies in the ProtÃ©gÃ© software, an ontology editor, having as its reasoning element the Hermit, for the necessary inferences. Accordingly, the constructed ontology called ONTODRC is characterized as a Clinical Decision Support System that has been validated computationally and in real HULW cases. After validating ONTODRC, we applied it in a sample of 185 primary care physicians in the town of JoÃ£o Pessoa, in two moments. In the first one, we applied a questionnaire to assess the pre and post knowledge on ONTODRC; and, in the second, we measured the perception of ease and usefulness of the tool with the technology acceptance model (TAM). In order to assess the effect of the intervention in the Knowledge assessment, we used the McNemarâs Test; and, to check the reliability of the TAM constructs, we used the Cronbachâs Alpha indicator (C.A.). In the results, we noted that the constructed ontology has an approximate capacity to respond to 90% of the surveyed requirements and also has the capacity to bring knowledge to the users. In turn, these users have considered the tool as useful and easy in their daily lives. We can conclude that the ONTODRC has the capacity to optimize the early diagnosis of CKD, in order to provide human, economic and environmental benefits.NenhumaA DoenÃ§a Renal CrÃ´nica (DRC) Ã© um problema de saÃºde pÃºblica, que acomete cerca de 10% da populaÃ§Ã£o adulta mundial, com mortalidade de 15% ao ano.

Using the state-of-the-art machine learning based classification techniques plays a crucial role in creating the optimal healthcare system on the edge. This thesis first provides a background on the current and emerging edge computing classification techniques for healthcare applications, specifically for electrocardiogram (ECG) beat classification. We then present key findings from an extensive survey of over hundred studies on the topic while taxonomizing the literature with respect to key architectural differences, application areas and requirements.  Leveraging the insights drawn from the extensive analysis of the pertinent literature we select a set of most promising machine learning based classification techniques for ECG beats, based on their suitability for implementation on a small edge device called a Raspberry Pi. After implementing these classification techniques on a Raspberry Pi based platform we perform a comparison of the performance of these classification techniques with respect to three key performance indicators (KPI) of interest for health care applications namely accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency.
ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart and help healthcare professionals to evaluate heart conditions of a patient, sometimes diagnosing life-threatening conditions. The features of ECG signals are pre-processed and fed into the classification algorithms to detect and classify abnormal beat types.  ECG classification requires low complexity but still high level of performance in terms of aforementioned three KPIs. The classification algorithms chosen, namely NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and distilled deep neural network (DNN) are all energy efficient methods hence suitable for implementation for small edge devices. The comparative multi-faceted evaluation presented in this thesis is a new contribution to research that exists on edge based classification as it offers comparison of selected classification algorithms in terms three KPIs instead of one while using real edge device based implementation. The performance of analyzed machine learning classification techniques is ranked according to each KPI. Benefiting from the results of the comparative analysis presented in this thesis a particular classification algorithm can be selected for optimal deployment in given scenario in healthcare system depending on the specific requirements of the given scenario.

Although running such workflows in clouds promises reduces operational costs, there are still numerous scheduling challenges to overcome. Such complex workflows are dynamic, exhibit periodic patterns, and combine diverse task groupings and requirements. In this work, we propose ANANKE, a scheduling system addressing these challenges. Our approach extends the state-of-the-art in portfolio scheduling for datacenters with a reinforcement-learning technique, and proposes various scheduling policies for managing complex workflows. Portfolio scheduling addresses the dynamic aspect of the workload. Reinforcement learning, based in this work on Q-learning, allows our approach to adapt to the periodic patterns of the workload, and to tune the other configuration parameters. The proposed policies are heuristics that guide the provisioning process, and map workflow tasks to the provisioned cloud resources. Through real-world experiments based on real and synthetic industrial workloads, we analyze and compare our prototype implementation of ANANKE with a system without portfolio scheduling (baseline) and with a system equipped with a standard portfolio scheduler. Overall, our experimental results give evidence that a learningbased portfolio scheduler can perform better (5â20%) and cost less (20â35%) than the considered alternatives.Distributed System",health,837,not included

With the development of immunoassy, traditional detection methods in clinical diagnostics have been replaced by many new techniques. One of the new techniques is the gold immunochromato- graphic assay (GICA). With the advantages of high efficiency of detection, easy of operation, pllution free and reagent stable, GICA has gained great attention in clinical diagnostics.       Because of its characteristics of convenient, fast and efficient, POCT (Point of Care Testing) has attracted much research interest and been rapid developed at home and abroad in recent years. With the implementation of China''s medical reform and the improvement of knowledge of disease prevention and health, POCT will play an increasingly important role in health care, disease prevention and monitoring in the future.       However, the performance of POCT instrument for colloidal gold lateral flow (LF) strip quantitative detection is low, and the price of imported POCT instrument is expensive. There are mainly two forms of measurements, i.e. scanning measurement and imaging measurement. For the scanning measurement, the measurement reproducibility would be affected by instrument vibration and other disturbing factors, and the measurement time is relatively long. Additionally, the scanning mechanism also complicates the instrumentâs structure. As for the imaging measurement, the LF strip picture is captured by image sensor. And image processing methods are used for quantitative analysis of the LF strip. So the imaging measurement is quick, stable, and has simple mechanical structure, etc. However, the image quality of the LF strip would directly affect the detection performance of the instrument. For example, illumination uniformity on the LF strip and the control parameters of image sensor has great impact on the image quality, and thus affect the measurement results. But the reported imaging measurement-based instruments are rarely concerned about the design of illumination uniformity and the control parameters.This situiation indicates that the research and development of high performance POCT instrument for colloidal gold LF strip quantitative detection with Chinese independent intellectual property rights is of great significance and value.       Aiming at researching and designing POCT instrument based on image sensor for colloidal gold LF strip quantitative detection with properties of sensitive, reproducible, fast, stable, portable, low power consumption, low cost, simple structure, etc., the main research work in this paper is as follows:       (1) An overview of the development and application of POCT and of the development of DSP technology, as well as of the development of POCT instrument for GICA quantitative detection is introduced.       (2) The GICA test strip quantitative detection theory, the optical properties of gold nanoparticles and the basic principles of immunogold labeling technique are analysed. Then deep researches on the colloidal gold LF strip structure and on the principle of the double-antibody sandwich GICA reaction have been done.       (3) The overall composition of the colloidal gold LF strip reader based on image sensor is researched and designed. The basic design modules of colloidal gold LF strip reader are introduced in three modules, i.e. optical module, control module and image algorithm module. Meanwhile, a new way to improve the performance of colloidal gold LF strip reader by the design of illumination uniformity and the optimization of image sensorâs image control parameters is proposed. Then, the basic design resources are introduced, including OV6630 image sensor, TMS320C6747 DSP chip and the embed real time operation system DSP/BIOS.       (4) The colloidal gold LF strip reader is researched and designed, including illumination uniformity design, image control parameters settings design of OV6630, internal hardwares operating methods and circuit connections, the software operation of C6747 DSP chip internal modules and the image data processing algorithms of quantitative detection. Two evaluation parameters are defined to evaluate the image for the optimization of image control parameters. At last, a prototype of colloidal gold LF strip reader has been developed on the basis of the detailed design, and the working process of this reader is introduced.       (5) Colloidal gold LF strips of Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are tested by the colloidal gold LF strip reader. The coefficients of variation of 20 times repetitive experiments with 0.25 ng/ml and 64 ng/ml are respectively 2.790% and 0.134%. The functional sensitivity is better than 0.25 ng/ml. The test results are fitted by 4-PL curve model, whose R^2 is more than 0.99, and the single measurement time is less than 1 sencond. It proofs that the design of colloidal gold LF strip reader is of properties of high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, good response property and reproducibility",health,839,not included

This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditionsâlikely on a space exploration missionâcan cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Our Integrated Software Health Management (ISWHM) system continuously monitors the hardware sensors and the software in real-time. The ISWHM uses Bayesian networks, compiled to arithmetic circuits, to model software and hardware interactions. Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.  As our initial demonstration platform, we use a primitive Lego rover. A Lego 
Mindstorms microcontroller is used to implement a highly simplified autonomous rover driving system, running on the OSEK real-time operating system. We demonstrate that our ISWHM, running on this small embedded microcontroller, can perform fault detection as well as on-board reasoning for advanced diagnosis and root-cause detection in real time",health,842,included

Recently, there has been growing interest in the neuromorphic emulation of the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) Hebbian learning rule by phenomenological modeling using CMOS, memristor or other analog devices. Here, we propose a CMOS circuit implementation of a biophysically grounded neuromorphic (iono-neuromorphic) model of synaptic plasticity that is capable of capturing both the spike rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP, of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro or BCM type) and STDP rules. The iono-neuromorphic model reproduces bidirectional synaptic changes with NMDA receptor-dependent and intracellular calcium-mediated long-term potentiation or long-term depression assuming retrograde endocannabinoid signaling as a second coincidence detector. Changes in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic weights are registered and stored in a nonvolatile and compact digital format analogous to the discrete insertion and removal of AMPA or GABA receptor channels. The versatile Hebbian synapse device is applicable to a variety of neuroprosthesis, brain-machine interface, neurorobotics, neuromimetic computation, machine learning, and neural-inspired adaptive control problems.National Institutes of Health (U.S.) (Grant Number EB005460)National Institutes of Health (U.S.) (Grant Number RR028241)National Institutes of Health (U.S.) (Grant Number HL067966",health,843,not included

Many diabetes expertians and organization work on this field still do some socializations in the real world or cyber. Diabetes is generally caused by life style and imbalancing of health quality in human life. As technology growing rapidly and different personal activities, digitally diabetes socialization and therapy should be considered. Means that, computer program using will be more effective for assisting diabetes threatment. The diabetes predetecting program implemented on this final project is one of computer program which is used to be the secondary tool on medical field, it detects someoneâs possibility of diabetes risk. Program works by gathering data from user then process it based on the rules base. This program was implemented using Ms. Visual Basic programming language and Ms. Access database, with forward chaining method on Artficial Intelligence scope. As the output, system will give result whether someone suffer from diabetes or not, with its diabetes type, diagnose, and recommendation. Technically, this program is still in its prototype, means that it needs further development. Diagnose result will be synchronized with standard medical threatment. So as the given recommendation. The program was tested to respondences with different input. In respondence testing, found that the program diagnose result has an accuracy value about 96,67 %. This means that forward chaining algorithm implemented on the software could result final decision which almost same as the doctor diagnose.Keyword: diabetes, expert system, diagnose, recommendation, forward chainin",health,845,not included
,to_check,core,,2010-10-16 00:00:00,core,university of verona,,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used in medical settings because of its ability to produce, non-invasively, high quality images of the inside of the human body. Since its introduction in early 70âs, more and more complex acquisition techniques have been proposed, raising MRI to be exploited in a wide spectrum of applications. Innovative MRI modalities, such as diffu- sion and functional imaging, require complex analysis techniques and advanced algorithms in order to extract useful information from the acquired data. The aim of the present work has been to develop and optimize state-of-the- art techniques to be applied in the analysis of MRI data both in experimental and clinical settings. During my doctoral program I have been actively involved in several research projects, each time facing many different issues. In this dissertation, however, I will report the results obtained in three most appealing projects I partecipated to. These projects were devoted (i) to the implementation of an innovative experimental protocol for functional MRI in laboratory animals, (ii) to the development of new methods for the analysis of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI data in experimental tumour models and (iii) to the analysis of diffusion MRI data in stroke patients. Particular emphasis will be given to the technical aspects regarding the algorithms and processing methods used in the analysis of data. Apart from a brief introduction on magnetic resonance imaging principles, the dissertation is organised in three parts, each one of them covering a separate topic dealt with during my doctoral studies. Each chapter is self-contained, in that it gives an introduction about the issue faced in the study, describes the methods and the techniques employed, and concludes with a discussion about the results obtained. Chapter 3 illustrates the methodology proposed by our group for an innovative method of fMRI (Activation-Induced Manganese Enhanced MRI, AIM-MRI) in rats. The method is based on in-vivo, absolute quantification of Mn concentration in different brain regions performed by fast T1 mapping and coregistration to a rat brain atlas. This strategy allows to quantify the accumulation of Mn in different regions of the rat brain, which is strictly related to the ac- tivation status of each area. This mechanism is similar to what happens in classical functional MRI studies but, in addition, it might be used for functional experiments performed in awake animals. In chapter 4 we cover the topic of tissues classification from MRI images in some experimental tumour models and present some advanced image-processing techniques we introduced for the analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCEMRI) data. In particular, we proposed to estimate a set of characteristic features from DCEMRI time profiles which well describe their shape, and then to extract peculiar behaviours which discriminate each tissue inside the tumour by combining cluster analysis and machine learning techniques. We have tested several approaches, each time comparing them with the state-of-the-art techniques of analysis for this kind of data. Finally, the proposed approach has been validated in a real case application in order to assess the efficacy of an anti-cancer therapy. Chapter 5 addresses the study on post-stroke plasticity carried out in collab- oration with the Signal Processing Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Brain structural connectivity was monitored with Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI), i.e. a high angular resolution diffusion MRI technique, during the functional recovery from the stroke, at hyperacute, acute and chronic stages after the lesion onset. The reproducibility of extracted fibre tracts has been extensively studied on healthy subjects, and the parameter set of fiber-tracking algorithm giving the best results was then used in patient analysis. The extracted fibre bundles between each pair of cortical regions were characterized by means of several connectivity measures",health,846,not included

Lâinnovazione tecnologica ha influenzato e condizionato le varie epoche, difatti, nel 1784 , con la prima rivoluzione industriale, si Ã¨ assistito all'invenzione del telaio e del motore a vapore, per poi arrivare al 1890 dove lâinvenzione dellâenergia elettrica Ã¨ stata sicuramente una delle scoperte piÃ¹ importanti, fino al 1970 in cui si Ã¨ assistito al sopravvento dellâautomazione e quindi alla costruzione dei primi computer. Arriviamo poi ai primi anni del 2000, dove in occasione della fiera di Hannover, per descrivere lâavvento della quarta rivoluzione industriale, fu coniato il termine âindustria 4.0â, ad evidenziare il passaggio da un sistema basato unicamente sulle interazioni fisiche tra uomo e macchina ad uno in cui lâinterazione tra dati e macchine costituisce la maggior parte delle operazioni produttive. Nel settore food, sia le ricerche che le innovazioni tecnologiche sono state condotte non solo da enti di ricerca ed universitÃ  ma anche dalle start-up, al fine di ottenere miglioramenti tecnologici e prodotti finora sconosciuti.
Il termine start-up (dall'inglese âinizioâ), indica lâavvio di una nuova impresa con tutto ciÃ² che ne comporta sia dal punto di vista strutturale che organizzativo e questâelaborato infatti, si basa sull'utilizzo del software SCM (Safeaty Content Management), nato dallo Spin-Off della UniversitÃ  di Pisa, ed applicato ad un servizio di catering aereo al fine di integrarsi nella gestione delle fasi che caratterizzano lâazienda stessa evidenziandone i vantaggi e le potenzialitÃ .
La missione principale del software Ã¨ quella di aiutare le aziende alimentari a redigere un piano di autocontrollo basato sul principio dellâ HACCP, senza incappare in errori o dimenticanze, il tutto a portata di un click. Il sistema HACCP sta alla base della piramide della sicurezza alimentare, ma prima ancora incontriamo il regolamento 178/02 e il pacchetto igiene. Il regolamento 178/02, costituisce la fonte primaria del moderno diritto alimentare europeo e racchiude in un unico testo i diritti ed i doveri di tutti gli operatori del settore alimentare, quindi sia quelli attribuiti agli OSA che quelli designati alle AutoritÃ  Competenti che effettuano i controlli in materia. Stabilisce inoltre i principi e i requisiti generali della legislazione alimentare segnando il passaggio da una moltitudine di normative nazionali, in attuazione delle direttive comunitarie ad un insieme razionale di regole comuni testualmente applicate nell'intero Mercato Unico. Con lâavvento di questa normativa poi, si Ã¨ attribuita una responsabilitÃ  primaria del raggiungimento degli obiettivi, agli operatori del settore alimentare; il compito di verifica invece, alle autoritÃ  di controllo. Si arriva poi al pacchetto igiene, un insieme di quattro testi legislativi, pubblicati per la prima volta nel 2004 ma entrati in vigore il 1Â° gennaio del 2006, e nominati: Regolamento 852/04, Regolamento 853/04, Regolamento 854/04 e regolamento 882/04 (gli ultimi due regolamenti sono stati abrogati e sostituiti dal Regolamento 625/2017).
I primi due regolamenti, sono indirizzati alle responsabilitÃ  che gli OSA devono ottemperare per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi di sicurezza; gli ultimi, invece, sono destinati alle autoritÃ  di controllo. Arriviamo cosÃ¬ allâHACCP, acronimo di âHazard Analysis and Critical Control Pointsâ, ovvero âAnalisi del pericolo e punti critici di controlloâ che costituisce un valido sistema, organizzato e razionale oltre che condiviso a livello europeo, per lâapplicazione dellâautocontrollo degli operatori che operano nelle industrie che trattano, manipolano o distribuiscono alimenti.
Lâapplicazione del sistema HACCP nasce proprio dall'esigenza di garantire la salubritÃ  delle produzioni alimentari cambiando approccio, cioÃ¨ passando da un controllo a valle del processo produttivo, che esisteva in passato ed effettuava il controllo sul prodotto finito, ad un controllo del processo produttivo in ogni sua fase, identificando quindi tutti i rischi che possono influire sulla sicurezza degli alimenti e attuando tutte le misure preventive necessarie a tenerli sotto controllo. Per cui, da un controllo di prodotto di tipo tradizionale, si Ã¨ passati ad un controllo di processo, cioÃ¨ il controllo di tipo moderno. In Italia Ã¨ stato introdotto nel 1997, dal D.lgs 155 del â97. Attualmente Ã¨ in vigore poichÃ© contemplato dal Regolamento CE 852 del 2004, il quale ha abrogato il precedente D.lgs 155 del â97. Lo sviluppo del metodo HACCP prevede che debbano essere attuati e rispettati i cosiddetti âprogrammi prerequisitoâ o PRPs, cioÃ¨ delle condizioni di base ed attivitÃ  necessarie a mantenere un ambiente in condizioni consone per la preparazione di prodotti sani e sicuri per il consumo umano.
Lâefficacia di questo metodo perÃ² si completa pienamente solo con lâottemperanza a 5 fasi preliminari (costituzione dellâHACCP team, descrizione del prodotto, descrizione dei possibili usi, realizzazione di un diagramma di flusso, verifica in campo) e 7 principi (analisi dei pericoli, individuazione dei CCP, definizione dei limiti critici, definizione dei monitoraggi, individuazione delle azioni correttive, verifica dellâefficacia del sistema e verifica della documentazione).
Il software utilizzato per questa tesi, permette di redigere un piano di gestione ed autocontrollo aziendale, basato proprio sui dettami dellâHACCP ma il tutto a portata di un click. Nel caso specifico, lo abbiamo utilizzato per unâazienda londinese, la Niche free-from kitchen, che opera nel settore del catering aereo. Dopo una prima analisi, abbiamo riscontrato che il software, semplifica le operazioni di gestione: difatti la visione dâinsieme delle produzioni aiuta lâoperatore a tenere sotto controllo in tempo reale eventuali non conformitÃ  per una risposta immediata; la dematerializzazione dei documenti porta benefici in termini di precisione del lavoro, risparmio economico e riduzione di ingombro volumetrico in ufficio nonchÃ© un impatto ambientale inferiore; per ultimo, ma non meno importante, essendo la gestione totalmente digitalizzata, Ã¨ senz'altro dâaiuto in un momento come quello che stiamo vivendo, in cui lo smart working ha assunto unâimportanza fondamentale.
My thesis its foundations on technological innovation, which is described as the set of activities that businesses and institutions adopt at the end of new products and services, to make them available and usable to consumers. Technological innovation has influenced and conditioned the various eras, in fact, in 1784, with the first industrial revolution, we witnessed the invention of the frame and the steam engine, and then went on to 1890 where the electrical invention was certainly one of the most important discoveries, until 1970 in which he witnessed the upper hand of automation and therefore the construction of the first computers. We come then to the early 2000s, where on the occasion of the Hannover fair, to describe the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, the term ""industry 4.0"" was coined, to highlight the transition from a system based on physical interactions between man and machine to one in which the interaction between the data and the machines carry out most of the production operations. In the food sector, both research and technological innovations have been conducted not only by research entities and universities but also by start-ups, in order to obtain technological improvements and unknown products.
The term start-up (from English ""start""), indicates an intervention by a new company with all that is necessary both from a structural and organizational point of view and this elaborate, in fact, is based on the use of the SCM software (Safeaty Content Management), born from the Spin-Off of the University of Pisa, and applied to an air catering service in order to integrate itself into the management of the phases that carried out the same highlighting its advantages and potential.
The main mission of the software is to help food companies to draw up a self-control plan based on the HACCP principle, without running into errors or forgetfulness, all just a click away. The HACCP system is at the base of the food safety pyramid, but before that we meet regulation 178/02 and the hygiene package. Regulation 178/02, constitutes the primary source of modern European food law and contains in a single text the rights and duties of all operators in the food sector, therefore both those attributed to the FBOs and those designated to the Competent Authorities that carry out the controls in the field. It also establishes the general principles and requirements of food law, marking the transition from a multitude of national regulations, in implementation of the EU directives to a rational set of common rules verbatim applied in the entire Single Market. With the advent of this legislation, then, primary responsibility for achieving the objectives has been attributed to operators in the food sector; the task of verification, however, to the supervisory authorities. Then comes the hygiene package, a set of four legislative texts, published for the first time in 2004 but which entered into force on 1st January 2006, and named: Regulation 852/04, Regulation 853/04, Regulation 854/04 and regulation 882/04 (the last two regulations have been repealed and replaced by regulation 625/2017).
The first two regulations are addressed to the responsibilities that the FBOs must comply with in order to achieve the safety objectives; the latter, however, are intended for supervisory authorities. Thus we come to HACCP, an acronym for ""Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points"", or ""Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points"" which constitutes a valid system, organized and rational as well as shared at European level, for the application of the self-control of operators operating in the industries that treat, manipulate or distribute food.
The application of the HACCP system arises precisely from the need to guarantee the healthiness of food production by changing the approach, that is, passing from a control downstream of the production process, which existed in the past and carried out the control on the finished product, to a control of the production process at each stage, therefore identifying all the risks that can affect the safety of food and implementing all the preventive measures necessary to keep them under control. So, from a traditional product control, we have passed to a process control, that is the modern control. In Italy it was introduced in 1997, by Legislative Decree 155 of 1997. It is currently in force since it is covered by EC Regulation 852 of 2004, which repealed the previous Legislative Decree 155 of 1997. The development of the HACCP method requires that the so-called ""prerequisite programs"" or PRPs, that is the basic conditions and activities necessary to maintain an environment in a suitable condition for the preparation of healthy and safe products for human consumption, must be implemented and respected.
The effectiveness of this method, however, is only fully completed with compliance with 5 preliminary phases (establishment of the HACCP team, description of the product, description of possible uses, creation of a flowchart, field verification) and 7 principles ( hazard analysis, identification of CCPs, definition of critical limits, definition of monitoring, identification of corrective actions, verification of the effectiveness of the system and verification of documentation).
The software used for this thesis allows you to draw up a business management and self-control plan, based precisely on the dictates of HACCP but all within a click. In the specific case, we used it for a London-based company, the Niche free-from kitchen, which operates in the airline catering sector.
After a first analysis, we found that the software simplifies management operations: in fact, the overall view of the productions helps the operator to monitor any non-compliance in real time for an immediate response; the dematerialisation of documents brings benefits in terms of precision of work, economic savings and reduction of volumetric dimensions in the office as well as a lower environmental impact; last, but not least, being fully digitalized management, it is certainly helpful at a time like the one we are experiencing, in which smart working has taken on a fundamental importance",industry,849,not included

This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.Â  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.Â  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.ÐÐµÑÐ¾Ð´Ñ Ð¼Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¸Ð½ÑÐµÐ»Ð»ÐµÐºÑÐ° Ñ Ð¾Ð±ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸ÐµÐ¼ Ð²Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑ ÑÐ²Ð¾Ñ ÑÐ¿ÐµÑÐ¸ÑÐ¸ÐºÑ Ðº ÑÐ¾Ð·Ð´Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ Ð¸Â Ð½Ð°Ð»Ð°Ð´ÐºÐµ Ð¸Ð³ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð¹ ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐµÐ¼Ñ.ÐÐ´Ð½Ð° Ð¸Ð· Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð²Ð½ÑÑ Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð»ÐµÐ¼ â ÑÑÐ¾ Ð½ÐµÐ¾Ð±ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¾ÑÑÑ Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´Ð²Ð¸Ð´ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ Ð²ÑÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð½Ð°Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ° Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð½ÑÑÂ ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¸ Ð²Ð¾Ð·Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ð½ÑÑ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÐ¾Ð² Ð½Ð° Ð¼Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÐ½ÑÐµ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÐµÐºÑÐ¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ Ð¸ Ð½ÐµÐ²Ð¾Ð·Ð¼Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑ ÑÐ°ÑÑÐ¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð¸ÑÂ Ð¸Ñ ÑÐ¿Ð¸ÑÐºÐ° Ð±ÐµÐ· Ð¿ÐµÑÐµÐ¾Ð±ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ.

,to_check,core,,2019-01-01 00:00:00,core,cool dh,Report on improved use of individual metering concept,"In a low temperature district heating (LTDH) system the importance of well performing network and customer installations are essential due to reduced operation margins. The use of low-value waste heat in the production sets limitations on the supply temperature. New piping materials sets limitations on the supply temperature and the pressure level. All in all, this means an increased focus on ensuring that DH installations arewell performing. This report is about âindividual metering conceptsâ. The LTDH-system is monitored by direct connection to the heat meters at all the consumers. The data from the heat meters can be used as a basis for describing, predicting and analysing the system's performance for better control of production and operation, for better conditions for troubleshooting and maintenance of the grid and the customer installations as well as for better customer service. The aim of this report is to:  give an overview over the current regulations for metering and billing of heat in Sweden and Denmark give an overview of desirable functionalities for DH meters and metering systems to provide input to applications that can be developed with the help of meter readings and which can be useful for the district heating industry describe how DH meter readings can be used for condition monitoring of service pipes and develop a method for this Regulations for metering and billing of DH follows EU regulations which says that all DH customers must be charged according to actual consumption. The overview of the current regulations for metering and billing in Denmark and Sweden shows that the two neighbouring countries have somewhat different approach to the individual metering concept. In Denmark there is a long tradition of individual metering in multifamily buildings and the tenants heat consumption is measured. In Sweden there is no such tradition and the individual metering concept generally is not in focus. Instead, the property owner is the customer. Denmark follows the Energy Efficiency Directive from 2012 (supplemented 2018) that requires individual metering and charging. The Swedish regulations on metering and billing are based on the exception in the EU regulation concerning individual metering and charging saying that individual metering must be economically justifiable. The Swedish National Board of Housing has shown that implementation of the EU regulations is not economically justifiable for the Swedish case â neither for existing buildings or in new buildings. There is a general attitude that increased frequency and higher resolution of meter readings automatically results in increased possibilities for new and improved analyses of customer performance. At present there are several researchers and research groups that are using meter readings from DH customers and machine learning with the aim to improve the energy performance of both the DH customer installations as well as the DH network and production operation. From ongoing projects four areas for applications have been identified: Fault detection, Load prediction, Production planning and Operational optimization. For these applications hourly meter readings are sufficient, at least in combination with historical data and weather conditions. For improved fault detection algorithms and moving towards fault diagnosis it would be beneficial to access secondary meter readings such as temperatures in the secondary side heatingâ and domestic hot water system as well as indoor temperatures. When moving on towards fault diagnosis, the frequency may also be in focus. A temporary shift to meter readings with higher frequency may be necessary for diagnosis. All in all, it might not be the frequency of the meter readings that should be increased, it might be more beneficial to include more meter parameters from the customer side of the heat exchanger. By integration of more meter parameters, the focus may shift from a matter of frequency to the broad concept of Internet of things (IoT). One scope within this project was to evaluate the feasibility for usage of meter readings from customer installations to detect increased heat losses in service pipes due to moisture. A theoretical study was carried out, but it did not turn into a success. Results showed that even though the heat losses in the service pipe increases due to moisture content, the impact on the measured parameters, that is temperature and flow, are low and would be hard to detect. A higher resolution or increased frequency of meter readings would not improve the feasibility to use meter readings for monitoring increased heat losses in service pipes since if feasible, it would require stable heat load at the customer installation and stable and known temperature conditions in the DH network. Through studies performed within this work and by other researchers it is clear that DH utilities, both in Denmark and Sweden, has a desire to improve customer performance and to reduce the DH return temperature. A key factor for success within this field is good customer relations and access to the customerâs DH substation. This may be a driving force for DHâutilities to offer service agreement and ICTâplatforms for greater customer engagement. Customers seems to be more willing to take actions to improve their installations if they understand why it is important. Recommendations: The following recommendations are given based on the overall picture provided by the report's different compilations and studies:  The meter should be able to measure the energy for every hour and be able to convert to measure with higher frequencies (minutes). Some types of measurement data analyses may require a higher resolution than hourly measurement, which is why the possibility of higher resolution should be provided, without that being a default setting.  It should be possible to remotely upgrading the meters and to remotely change the meter frequency. This will provide that new functionalities can be introduced in a costâefficient way and that expensive field visits can be avoided.  Access to secondary meter readings. The following measurements were seen as the most important: Indoor temperatures, secondary temperatures measured on branches for the heating system in the building, and measurement on the district heating differential pressure. Measuring these parameters would be beneficial for developing algorithms for fault detection and for improving system performance for the total district heating system, as well as for as being able to guarantee the quality of energy supplies at the customer substations.  There should be a digital interface that the end customers can use to access their energy consumption locally. The communication solution should also support a future standard for communication with devices in the home. In order to be of real use for the customers, this should be delivered with some kind of analysis tools that can help the customers relate their consumption or data to reference data (for example historical data, norms or set point values) and that can provide the customer with extended analysis that make sense to the customer",industry,853,not included

This leads to a significant complication of the cyber threat landscape, an increase in the number of cyberattacks with a significant increase in the negative financial and non-financial consequences that cyberattacks have on the banking system and the economy as a whole. The author, based on the generalization of research on this topic, clarified the content of the concept of ""cyber resilience of a bank"". Its essential characteristics were determined in the context of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The article studies theoretical approaches to ensuring the cyber resilience of banks, which made it possible to develop a conceptual model of the mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience, adequate to the current state and conditions in which the banks of Ukraine operate. The developed mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience allows for: 1) the formalization of the landscape of real and potential cyber threats; 2) ensures the consistency of mechanisms and tools for countering them, adapting and/or recovering from cyber incidents; 3) allows not only to adequately respond to existing cyber threats but also to identify negative factors that can lead to the emergence and implementation of new cyber threats and cyber-attacks. According to the results of the study, it was found that the effective functioning of the mechanism for ensuring the cyber resilience of the bank requires appropriate organizational support. For this, the author substantiated the need to create a Bank Cyber Resilience Center. It should include representatives from the departments responsible for banking business continuity, cybersecurity, cyber risk management and IT quality. This will allow obtaining a synergistic effect by creating a single interconnected process-based model, including metrics of the bank's cyber resilience level and KPIs, as well as tools for monitoring, controlling and resisting external and internal cyber threats, adaptation and/or recovery after them",industry,854,not included

The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks",industry,855,not included

From coding to computational thinking through computational mathematics problem based learning (CM-PBL),"4th Industrial revolution are spreading around the world, embedding the technology into societies. In the digital revolution, high technological tools and resources are regularly being developed. There has been increased attention on learning coding in education field, in order to nurture sufficient number of young generation to fill in 50 percent of jobs opportunity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which are computing-related. It is increasingly clear that our new generation need to think critically to solve the ill-structured problems, uncertain and complex real world problems. Computational thinking is beneficial in providing automated or semi-automated solutions in problems solving in combination with critical thinking. Therefore, computational thinking is becoming an important implication in science and mathematics as well as in almost every other fields. This fact is reflected in the recent implementation of computer coding in the Malaysiaâs school curriculum to nurture 21st century skills among students. Computational thinking is one of the conceptual foundations which required combination of data and ideas to solve problems effectively and efficiently. Computational thinking is essential to computing and information science (i.e., algorithmically, with or without the assistance of computers) to solve problems with solutions that are reusable in different contexts. Promoting different kind of skills and abilities among students is important to solve the complexity problem in real world. Thus, it is a challenging task for many instructors to create a learning environment who lack of feasible resources availability and research-based information to redesign their teaching pedagogies. This conceptual framework is aimed at two goals: (1) development of deep learning, connected computational thinking through the mathematical curriculum instructional model which able to enhance studentsâ problem solving abilities and (2) implementation of the designed model to assist teacher in education who has practicing difficulty in elementary classrooms after adopting teacher enactment of problem-based curriculum resources. To achieve these goals, computational mathematics problem based learning (CM-PBL) instructional strategy is developed to promote an active learning environment for classroom management involving problem solving. Rather than emphasizing student learning passively through listening, watching, practicing exercises and imitating isolated skills, the CM-PBL learning framework allowing students to simulate and build their own computational models to support their self-learning and understanding of mathematic concepts. It is also highlights ways that students can evolve from technical skills in using technology to soft engineering skills by using coding knowledge",industry,856,not included

The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology&rsquo;s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders&mdash;consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries&mdash;and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers&rsquo; needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers&rsquo; needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets.

We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge. As proven by previous hardware emulation tools, there is also a potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine early in the development cycle. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by predictive software running on a desktop computer. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL Safety Critical API. First, we create nonparametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames per second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated. To validate our models, we render an industrial scene with characteristic combinations not used during the training phase and we compare the predictions to those real values. We find a median prediction error of less than 4 FPS",industry,859,not included

Data preprocessing is a fundamental step in the analysis of measurements, and a first step before applying machine learning. To reduce the influence of distortions from signals, selective digital filtering is applied to minimize or remove unwanted components. Standard software and hardware digital filtering algorithms introduce a delay, which has to be compensated for to avoid destroying signal associations. The delay from filtering becomes more crucial when the analysis involves measurements from multiple sensors, therefore in this paper we provide an overview and comparison of existing digital filtering methods with an application based on real-life marine examples. In addition, the design of special-purpose filters is a complex process and for preprocessing data from many sources, the application of digital filtering in the time domain can have a high numerical cost. For this reason we describe discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering as a tool for efficient sensor data preprocessing, which does not introduce a time delay and has low numerical cost. The discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering has a simpler implementation and does not require expert-level filter design knowledge, which is beneficial for practitioners from various disciplines. Finally, we exemplify and show the application of the methods on real signals from marine systems",industry,860,not included

As stated by Suhâs Complexity Theory, the relative complexity of a design concept is caused by couplings between functional requirements (FRs) and design parameters (DPs), and can be reduced by strategically ordering the execution (i.e., implementation) sequence of DPs. However, it is generally very difficult in the current design practice to obtain this âexecution sequenceâ with existing methods due to their inherent limitations and/or many real-world restrictions. Meanwhile, many practical methods, such as the modular design approach, have been widely used in industries to produce real-world design results that donât necessarily conform with the principles required by those ideal design theories. As a result, from the perspectives of design theories, most real-world designs are ânot idealâ (i.e., having some relative complexities due to FR-DP couplings) and therefore can (and should) be improved by better sequencing their DPs. This is the motivation under which the Design Coupling Sequence (DCS) method was developed in this thesis research. The DCS method can assist designers to automatically obtain the âexecution sequences,â in the forms of functional sets, that can yield the minimal relative complexity, hence making a practical design concept most ideal (i.e., as close to the ideal concept with the minimal relative complexity as possible) while taking into practical considerations (such as increasing the modularity to lower the production costs) in real-world conceptual designs. â§ The DCS method defines the âprecedenceâ between âfunctional setsâ to manage coupled design concepts to support the modular approach during conceptual design. It identifies the âprecedenceâ by the level of functional coupling to determine the proper sequencing order to minimize the overall complexity. Two types of functional sets are defined in DCS as 1) the complete independently set U: the collection of all the functionally dependent DPs in the system so that the set is independent to other U sets, and 2) the indivisible coupled set C: the collection of coupled concepts that canât be decoupled by sequencing, so it prescribes the designer to consider the group of DPs together as a set to match existing modules in the database. To handle the real complexity of design concepts which require redesign, the DCS algorithm helps to determine the proper execution sequence. To minimize the imaginary complexity, which occurs when design concepts âappearâ to be functionally coupled due to a lack of understanding of the system structure, the DCS method provides a formula to reveal the number of acceptable execution sequences that can lead to the simplest design implementation. Compared with existing methods, the DCS method is applicable for any design cases with known design matrices, including the square, rectangular, zero-at-diagonal, large, and/or numerical matrices. In short, for all practical design cases, DCS can organize functional-coupled design concepts as âfunctional setsâ with execution sequences of DPs that lead to the minimal complexity of this design concept. â§ The foundation, hypothesis, algorithm and its usability of the DCS method are validated by four case studies in this research. The faucet design case demonstrates how to apply the DCS method and shows the differences between ADT and DCS results. The case of coffee maker design shows how the DCS method manages the functional sets based on the design matrices reengineered from existing design concepts. The vehicle tire design case demonstrates how different DCS strategies within the Innovative Design Thinking (IDT framework during the conceptual design stage can work in a real-world product development situation. The IDT framework prescribes four consecutive steps: (1) following the top-down process to ideate new design concepts that satisfy the principles/axioms suggested by the design theory to reach a certain layer of details, (2) following the bottom-up process to identify some existing design modules from available engineering database (or catalogs) that can satisfy the functional requirements at this detail layer, (3) constructing the design matrix that shows the couplings between FRs and DPs at this detail layer, and (4) apply the DCS algorithm to determine the execution sequence of DPs based on the above design matrix. This will yield a new design concept with an execution sequence that is most creative (because it satisfies the design principles at the top layers) and most practical (because it utilizes the existing modules at the bottom layers). Finally, a case of collision avoidance planning presents one of the possible extensions of the DCS algorithm. â§ The results of this research have significant impacts on both design theory and design practice. Theoretically, the approach in this research 1) guides designers to improve concepts not only organizing design matrix but also extract additional coupling information to increase modularity and 2) is a more generalized approach than the previous methods that can be applied to any design cases with design matrix. Practically, the research 1) demonstrates the usability of the DCS algorithm within an executive program to generate the DCS functional sets automatically for large design system and 2) allows the principle of functional dependency and the practice of modular design to be considered simultaneously as much as possible during the conceptual design stage. It is a fundamental contribution that demonstrates how the ideal principles (or axioms) of design theories can be used together strategically with practical design methods (or considerations) in industry practices to generate real-world design results that are both most practical and creative. For future research, there would be three aspects- DCS algorithm, DCS sets, and DCS strategies. Number one, DCS algorithm would be further revised to extend to software design or machine learning with functional sets in terms of a component diagram. Number two, with DCS sets, the three-dimensional design matrix could be studied further. Number three, DCS strategies would be investigated further for applying on detailed design cases. â§ As a recap, the research prescribes a functional coupling managing algorithm with functional sets for suggesting acceptable execution sequences in conceptual design. It not only helps designers with complexity reduction but also bridges the ideal design theory to practical modules. The designer can create better designs that are most creative and yet practical by using the DCS strategies",industry,861,not included

Data preprocessing is a fundamental step in the analysis of measurements, and a first step before applying machine learning. To reduce the influence of distortions from signals, selective digital filtering is applied to minimize or remove unwanted components. Standard software and hardware digital filtering algorithms introduce a delay, which has to be compensated for to avoid destroying signal associations. The delay from filtering becomes more crucial when the analysis involves measurements from multiple sensors, therefore in this paper we provide an overview and comparison of existing digital filtering methods with an application based on real-life marine examples. In addition, the design of special-purpose filters is a complex process and for preprocessing data from many sources, the application of digital filtering in the time domain can have a high numerical cost. For this reason we describe discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering as a tool for efficient sensor data preprocessing, which does not introduce a time delay and has low numerical cost. The discrete Fourier transformation digital filtering has a simpler implementation and does not require expert-level filter design knowledge, which is beneficial for practitioners from various disciplines. Finally, we exemplify and show the application of the methods on real signals from marine systems.acceptedVersionÂ© 2018. This is the authors' accepted and refereed manuscript to the article.

implementados em software, com objetivo de estimar e prever o comportamento de impurezas na corrente de base de uma coluna de destilaÃ§Ã£o de alta pureza, do processo produtivo do 1,2 Dicloroetano (C2H4Cl2). A aquisiÃ§Ã£o dos dados utilizados na construÃ§Ã£o dos sensores virtuais foi realizada atravÃ©s do modelo matemÃ¡tico do processo, simulado com dados reais de uma planta industrial. O estudo especÃ­fico engloba a modelagem matemÃ¡tica/termodinÃ¢mica e avaliaÃ§Ã£o do comportamento estacionÃ¡rio e dinÃ¢mico dessa torre, simulada aqui no software Aspen Plus e DynamicsTM. Desse modo, o modelo fornece os dados necessÃ¡rios para inferÃªncia das impurezas relacionadas, que sÃ£o os teores dos compostos tetracloreto de carbono (CCl4) e clorofÃ³rmio (CHCl3), ambos devem ser mantidos, respectivamente, em valores â¤3000 e â¤400 ppm (partes por

produzidos nÃ£o utilizavam as concentraÃ§Ãµes dos compostos das correntes de alimentaÃ§Ã£o e sim mediÃ§Ãµes de temperaturas ao longo da torre. Uma importante conclusÃ£o do ponto de vista de construÃ§Ã£o de sensores virtuais, porque na maioria dos trabalhos desenvolvidos essas variÃ¡veis sÃ£o cruciais na produÃ§Ã£o de bons resultados. O treinamento dos sensores virtuais foi efetuado em um ambiente ruidoso, haja vista que foram simulados ruÃ­dos inerentes Ã s mediÃ§Ãµes (ruÃ­dos brancos Gaussianos). Na etapa final, os sensores virtuais sÃ£o construÃ­dos utilizando uma tÃ©cnica de modelagem empÃ­rica, redes neurais artificiais (RNA), onde foram utilizadas RNA do tipo Perceptron Multicamadas (MLP).

Logo, com essas estimativas espera-se a minimizaÃ§Ã£o e a previsÃ£o do comportamento transiente dos compostos no referido processo.This work proposes a methodology for software implementation to make soft sensors.

The goal is to estimate and predict the behavior of impurities in the bottom current of a highpurity distillation column, for 1,2-Dichloroethane or 1,2-DCE (C2H4Cl2) production. The data acquisition used in the construction of soft sensors was performed through a mathematical simulation of the process, with real industrial data taken from an industrial plant. A specific study involves the mathematical modeling, thermodynamics, evaluation of the steady state and the dynamic behavior of this process, simulated here in Aspen Plus and Aspen DynamicsTM software. Thus, the model provides the necessary data to infer the contents of the carbon impurities mentioned above, Tetrachloride (CCl4) and Chloroform (CHCl3), which are to be fixed approximately below 3000 and 400 ppm (parts per million) respectively. The methodology also covers selection algorithms of secondary variables, using multivariate statistical techniques: All Possible Regressions (TRP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data generated was checked in order to know whether to include or not a step for removal of outliers, so it was also included in the methodology one preprocessing data step. The ten best inference models

were selected for each output concentration. With this information, these models do not use concentrations measurements in the feed streams but measurements of the temperature along the column. This is an important conclusion from the point of view of virtual sensors building, because in most of the literature reported these variables are crucial in getting good results. The training of soft sensors was done in a noisy environment, considering that simulated noise was inherent to measurements (Gaussian noise). In the final step, the soft sensors devices are constructed using an empirical modeling technique of artificial neural networks (ANN), which were generated ANN type Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Several variations were also evaluated on the number of neurons and hidden layers of networks, employing as a stopping criterion the

cross-validation technique. The developed soft sensors presented satisfactory errors from the engineering viewpoint, a good regression and a good mean square error. Finally, with these estimations it is expected to minimize and predict the transient behavior of the compounds in the referred process",industry,863,not included

Extruder calibration <a id=""extcal""></a>
To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly.
Calibration set-up <a id=""calset""></a>
In principle, the calibration set-up requires:

CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor)
the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts)
a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable)

The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement.
Calibration procedure <a id=""calpro""></a>

adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values)
command piston movement for an exact distance
measure the real movement distance and compare
repeat steps 1-3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value

For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M5 spindle (0.5mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914.30.
Thermistor calibration <a id=""thermcal""></a>
Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section.
EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass.

pour a small glass of oil (50mL or so)
place the glass on the heat source
fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer
sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil
prepare the system to read analog values 
turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1Â°C increment
plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature)
fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others)
software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega)

Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values.

,to_check,core,,2017-01-01 00:00:00,core,bayesian modeling for optimization and control in robotics,,"Robotics has the potential to be one of the most revolutionary technologies in human history. The impact of cheap and
potentially limitless manpower could have a profound influence on our everyday life and overall onto our society. As
envisioned by Iain M. Banks, Asimov and many other science fictions writers, the effects of robotics on our society might
lead to the disappearance of physical labor and a generalized increase of the quality of life. However, the large-scale
deployment of robots in our society is still far from reality, except perhaps in a few niche markets such as manufacturing.
One reason for this limited deployment of robots is that, despite the tremendous advances in the capabilities of the
robotic hardware, a similar advance on the control software is still lacking. The use of robots in our everyday life is still
hindered by the necessary complexity to manually design and tune the controllers used to execute tasks. As a result,
the deployment of robots often requires lengthy and extensive validations based on human expert knowledge, which
limit their adaptation capabilities and their widespread diffusion. In the future, in order to truly achieve an ubiquitous
robotization of our society, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of deploying new robots in new environments and
tasks.
The goal of this dissertation is to provide automatic tools based on Machine Learning techniques to simplify and
streamline the design of controllers for new tasks. In particular, we here argue that Bayesian modeling is an important tool
for automatically learning models from raw data and properly capture the uncertainty of the such models. Automatically
learning models however requires the definition of appropriate features used as input for the model. Hence, we present
an approach that extend traditional Gaussian process models by jointly learning an appropriate feature representation
and the subsequent model. By doing so, we can strongly guide the features representation to be useful for the subsequent
prediction task.
A first robotics application where the use of Bayesian modeling is beneficial is the accurate learning of complex dynamics models. For highly non-linear robotic systems, such as in presence of contacts, the use of analytical system
identification techniques can be challenging and time-consuming, or even intractable. We introduce a new approach for
learning inverse dynamics models exploiting artificial tactile sensors. This approach allows to recognize and compensate
for the presence of unknown contacts, without requiring a spatial calibration of the tactile sensors. We demonstrate
on the humanoid robot iCub that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art analytical models, and when employed in
control tasks significantly improves the tracking accuracy.
A second robotics application of Bayesian modeling is automatic black-box optimization of the parameters of a controller. When the dynamics of a system cannot be modeled (either out of complexity or due to the lack of a full state
representation), it is still possible to solve a task by adapting an existing controller. The approach used in this thesis is
Bayesian optimization, which allows to automatically optimize the parameters of the controller for a specific task. We
evaluate and compare the performance of Bayesian optimization on a gait optimization task on the dynamic bipedal
walker Fox. Our experiments highlight the benefit of this approach by reducing the parameters tuning time from weeks
to a single day.
In many robotic application, it is however not possible to always define a single straightforward desired objective.
More often, multiple conflicting objectives are desirable at the same time, and thus the designer needs to take a decision
about the desired trade-off between such objectives (e.g., velocity vs. energy consumption). One framework that is
useful to assist in this decision making is the multi-objective optimization framework, and in particular the definition of
Pareto optimality. We propose a novel framework that leverages the use of Bayesian modeling to improve the quality
of traditional multi-objective optimization approaches, even in low-data regimes. By removing the misleading effects
of stochastic noise, the designer is presented with an accurate and continuous Pareto front from which to choose the
desired trade-off. Additionally, our framework allows the seamless introduction of multiple robustness metrics which can
be considered during the design phase. These contributions allow an unprecedented support to the design process of
complex robotic systems in presence of multiple objective, and in particular with regards to robustness.
The overall work in this thesis successfully demonstrates on real robots that the complexity of deploying robots to solve
new tasks can be greatly reduced trough automatic learning techniques. We believe this is a first step towards a future
where robots can be used outside of closely supervised environments, and where a newly deployed robot could quickly
and automatically adapt to accomplish the desired tasks",industry,867,included

No caso da geometria dos cordÃµes de solda no processo GMAW, diferentes pesquisas tÃªm sido encaminhadas ao controle dos parÃ¢metros operacionais que garantam as caracterÃ­sticas geomÃ©tricas requeridas, entre as mais importantes, a largura, o reforÃ§o e a penetraÃ§Ã£o. Atualmente, diferentes modelos baseados em modelamento empÃ­rico ou em inteligÃªncia artificial sÃ£o utilizados para controlar um parÃ¢metro geomÃ©trico Ã  vez.

In the case of weld bead geometry in GMAW processes, different researches have been conducted to control operating parameters and to ensure required geometrical characteristics, among the most important: the width, the height and the penetration. Currently, different models, based on empirical modeling or artificial intelligence methodologies, are used to control individual geometric parameters. This work proposes a strategy that, regardless of predefined models, can simultaneously control the width and the height of the weld beads in GMAW-S process. The proposed control system is based on intelligent agents focus on measurements of the weld bead width and height. The geometric parameters monitoring is performed in real time using a single camera and different methods of digital image processing. The evaluation of process stability is performed in real time and employed to avoid the regions of instability in which may incur this process during the control stage. The monitoring methodology is assessed as satisfactory using the âtâ test for different combinations of input parameters. The time of the image processing does not exceed 3 ms for each image and is considered appropriate to control steps, which use a 100 Hz sampling rate. The experimental results show that the implementation of the proposed control strategy is feasible in systems control without predefined model, achieving different width and height reference bead values",industry,871,not included

Of many common relevant research topics, virtual prototyping is currently one of the most important. In this paper, we describe our first complete version of a generic and modular software framework for intelligent computer-automated product design. We present our framework in the context of design of offshore cranes, with easy extensions to other products, be it maritime or not. Funded by the Research Council of Norway and its Programme for Regional R&D and Innovation (VRI), the work we present has been part of two separate but related research projects (grant nos. 241238 and 249171) in close cooperation with two local maritime industrial partners. We have implemented several software modules that together constitute the framework, of which the most important are a server-side crane prototyping tool (CPT), a client-side web graphical user interface (GUI), and a client-side artificial intelligence for product optimisation (AIPO) module that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) library for optimising design parameters to achieve a crane design with desired performance. Communication between clients and server is achieved by means of the HTTP and WebSocket protocols and JSON as the data format. To demonstrate the feasibility of the fully functioning complete system, we present a case study where our computer-automated design was able to improve the existing design of a real and delivered 50-tonnes, 2.9 million EUR knuckleboom crane with respect to some chosen desired design criteria. Our framework being generic and modular, both clientside and server-side modules can easily be extended or replaced. We demonstrate the feasibility of this concept in an accompanying paper submitted concurrently, in which we create a simple product optimisation client in Matlab that uses readily available toolboxes to connect to the CPT and optimise various crane designs by means of a GA. In addition, our research team is currently developing a winch prototyping tool to which our existing AIPO module can connect and optimise winch designs with only small configuration changes.

Laser milling is a relatively new micro-manufacturing technique in the production of high-value industrial components. The industrial problem is defined by a data set relayed through standard sensors situated on a laser-milling centre, which is a machine tool for manufacturing high-value micro-moulds, micro-dies and micro-tools. The new three-phase industrial system presented in this study is capable of identifying a model for the laser-milling process based on low-order models. The first two steps are based on the use of unsupervized connectionist models. The first step involves the analysis of the data sets that define each case study to identify if they are informative enough or if the experiments have to be performed again. In the second step, a feature selection phase is performed to determine the main variables to be processed in the third step. In this last step, the results of the study provide a model for a laser-milling procedure based on low-order models, such as black-box, in order to approximate the optimal form of the laser-milling process. The three-step model has been tested with real data obtained for three different materials: aluminium, cooper and hardened steel. These three materials are used in the manufacture of micro-moulds, micro-coolers and micro-dies, high-value tools for the medical and automotive industries among others. As the model inputs are standard data provided by the laser-milling centre, the industrial implementation of the model is immediate. Thus, this study demonstrates how a high precision industrial process can be improved using a combination of artificial intelligence and identification techniques",industry,874,not included

Papers were selected on the basis of fundamental ideas and concepts rather than the direct usage of well-established techniques. This special issue is then aimed at practitioners, researchers and post-graduate students, who are engaged in developing and applying advanced Soft Computing Models to solving real-world problems in the Industrial and Environmental fields. The papers are organized as follows. In the first contribution, GraÃ±a and Gonzalez-AcuÃ±a develop a formulation of dendritic classifiers based on lattice kernels and train them using a direct Monte Carlo approach and a Sparse Bayesian Learning. The results of both kinds of training are compared with the Relevance Vector Machines on a collection of benchmark datasets. In the second contribution by Irigoyen and MiÃ±ano, the authors present the results of the identification of the relationship in time, between the required exercise (machine resistance) and the heart rate of the patient in medical effort tests, using a NARX neural network model. In the experimental stage, test data have been obtained by exercising with a cyclo-ergometer in two different tests: Power Step Response and Conconi. Carneiro et al. in the third contribution present a biologically inspired method to deal with the problem in which genetic algorithms are used to create possible solutions for a given dispute. The approach presented is able to generate a broad number of diverse solutions that cover virtually the whole search space for a given problem. The results of this work are being applied in a negotiation tool that is part of the UMCourt conflict resolution platform. In the fourth contribution by Donate et al., they propose a novel Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) approach, where a weighted n-fold validation fitness scheme is used to build an ensemble of neural networks, under four different combination methods: mean, median, softmax and rank-based combinations. Several experiments were held, using six real-world time series with different characteristics and from distinct domains. Overall, the proposed approach achieved competitive results when compared with non weighted n-fold EANN ensembles, the simpler 0-fold EANN and also the popular HoltâWinters statistical method. Dan Burdescu et al. in the fifth contribution, present a system used in the medical domain for three distinct tasks: image annotation, semantic based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. An original image segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure was used to perform the segmentation of medical images. Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The annotation and semantic based retrieval task is evaluated for two annotation models: Cross Media Relevance Model and Continuous-space Relevance Model. Semantic based image retrieval is performed using the methods provided by the annotation models. The ontology used by the annotation process was created in an original manner starting from the information content provided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The experiments were made using a database containing colour images retrieved from medical domain using an endoscope and related to digestive diseases. In sixth paper by Pedraza et al., they develop a face recognition system based on soft computing techniques, which complies with privacy-by-design rules and defines a set of principles that context-aware applications (including biometric sensors) should contain to conform to European and US law. This research deals with the necessity to consider legal issues concerning privacy or human rights in the development of biometric identification in ambient intelligence systems. Clearly, context-based services and ambient intelligence (and the most promising research area in Europe, namely ambient assisted living, ALL) call for a major research effort on new identification procedures. The aim of the research by Redel-MacÃ­as et al. in paper seven is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem. In the eighth paper, Wu et al. analyse the existence criterion of loop strategies, and then present some corollaries and theorems, by which the loop strategies and chain strategies can be found, also superfluous strategies and inconsistent strategies. It presents a ranking model that indicates the weak node in strategy set and it also introduces a probability-based model which is the basis of evaluation of strategy. Additionally, this research proposes a method to generate offensive strategy, and the statistic results of simulation game prove the validity of the method. Pop et al. in the ninth paper present an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a localâglobal approach to the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) and a powerful local search procedure. The computational experiments on several benchmarks instances show that the hybrid algorithm is competitive to all of the known heuristics published to date. In the tenth paper Kramer et al. illustrate how methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting, and monitoring techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable, and smart energy grids. The study is based on the application of kernel methods like support vector regression and kernel density estimation as prediction methods. Furthermore, dimension reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of high-dimensional wind time series are applied. The methods are briefly introduced, related work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The experimental parts are based on real wind energy time series data from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Vera et al. in the eleventh contribution present a novel soft computing procedure based on the application of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and identification systems, which makes it possible to optimise the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving both time and financial costs and/or energy. The novel proposed approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. The final contribution, by Sakalauskas and Kriksciuniene, presents a research about financial market efficiency and to recognize major reversal points of long-term trend of stock market index, which could indicate forthcoming crisis or market raise periods. The study suggests a computational model of financial time series analysis, which combines several approaches of soft computing, including information efficiency evaluation methods (Shannon's entropy, Hurst exponent), neural networks and sensitivity analysis. The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behaviour, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index. The performance of neural network model is explored by applying sensitivity analysis and resulted in selecting smoothing parameters of the input variables. The experimental research investigates behaviour of the long-term trend of the three emerging financial markets within NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchange. Introduction of information efficiency measures improve ability of the model to recognize the approaching reversal of long-term trend from temporary market ânervousnessâ and can be useful for calibrating stock trading strategy.

In early stages of graphics processing, such tasks were delegated to a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Over time as more complex graphics rendering was demanded, CPU solutions became inadequate. To meet this demand, custom hardware solutions that take advantage of pipelining and massive parallelism become more preferable to CPU software based solutions. This fact has lead to the many custom hardware solutions that are available today. Since real time graphics processing requires extreme high performance, hardware solutions using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the standard within the industry. While ASICs are a more than adequate solution for implementing high performance custom hardware, the design, implementation and testing of ASIC based designs are becoming cost prohibitive due to the massive up front verification effort needed as well as the cost of fixing design defects.Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide an alternative to the ASIC design flow. More importantly, in recent years FPGA technology have begun to improve in performance to the point where ASIC and FPGA performance has become comparable. In addition, FPGAs address many of the issues of the ASIC design flow. The ability to reconfigure FPGAs reduces the upfront verification effort and allows design defects to be fixed easily. This thesis demonstrates that a 3-D graphics processor implementation on and FPGA is feasible by implementing both a two dimensional and three dimensional graphics processor prototype. By using a Xilinx Virtex 5 ML506 FPGA development kit a fully functional wireframe graphics rendering engine is implemented using VHDL and Xilinx's development tools. A VHDL testbench was designed to verify that the graphics engine works functionally. This is followed by synthesizing the design and real hardware and developing test applications to verify functionality and performance of the design.

The opportunities of an effective use of these new data sources are enormous, however, the huge size and dimensionality of current large databases call for new ideas to scale up current statistical and computational approaches. This paper presents an application of Artificial Intelligence technology to the problem of automatic detection of candidate anomalous records in a large database. We build our approach with three main goals in mind: 1)An effective detection of the records that are potentially anomalous, 2)A suitable selection of the subset of attributes that explains what makes a record anomalous, and 3)An efficient implementation that allows us to scale the approach to large databases. Our algorithm, called Bayesian Network Anomaly Detector (BNAD), uses 2 the joint probability density function (pdf) provided by a Bayesian Network (BN) to achieve these goals. By using appropriate data structures, advanced caching techniques, the flexibility of Gaussian Mixture models, and the efficiency of BNs to model joint pdfs, BNAD manages to efficiently learn a suitable BN from a large dataset.

Elevados requisitos de qualidade visam garantir maior produtividade, estabilidade operacional e acabamento superficial das bobinas laminadas. O primeiro estÃ¡gio da solidificaÃ§Ã£o do aÃ§o se inicia no molde onde o aÃ§o lÃ­quido, em contato com as faces do molde, forma uma casca externa solidificada. Um dos fenÃ´menos mais prejudiciais Ã  produÃ§Ã£o e manutenÃ§Ã£o da regularidade superficial da placa Ã© o colamento do aÃ§o na face cobreada do molde, que leva a ruptura da pele de aÃ§o em formaÃ§Ã£o.

During the continuous casting process, the steel is solidified under a slab shape, which will be forward to post processes, demanding a smooth and roughness free surface appearance. Higher quality requirements aim to guarantee productivity increase, operational stability and greater superficial finishing of the laminated coils. The very first stage of steel solidification has its start on the mould where the liquid steel, facing the mould copper plates, forms an external solidified shell. One of the most harmful phenomena to the production regularity maintenance and superficial evenness of the slab is the steel sticking to the copper mould plates, which leads to the rupture of the solidifying shell. The shell break-out, as nominated, causes instant and emergency stoppage of the continuous casting machine and inproduction slabs scrapping. In order to avoid break-out occurrences, the mould has two thermocouple lines installed on the plates for real time monitoring of the heat transfer conditions during casting. A software compares the actual thermal profile with the existent data base concerning sticker events on the mould. The program Mold Sticker Detection (MSD) is used to inhibit break-outs. When the MSD understands that in a specific time a sticking is progress, it generates an alarm reducing instantaneously the casting speed to a safety value. This sudden reduction is provided to give enough time to have the steel shell rebuilt, but also marks deeply the slab surface besides those deriving from the sticking itself. This work has the objective to develop a fuzzy based model to be incorporated to the existing break-out detect system â MSD, aiming to reduce the occurrences of sticker alarms by establishing the ideal casting speed concerning the actual heat extraction conditions on the mould. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed model, will be evaluated the production losses, number of sticker alarms and break-outs as well",industry,879,not included

The bacterium has as closest relatives M. chelonae, M. abscessus and collectively these bacteria form the M. chelonae complex. The early detection of M. immunogenum and other bacteria implicated in the causation of HP may be crucial to reducing its prevalence. As detection by conventional techniques such as cultured is severely limited, an M. immunogenum-specific quantitative real-time PCR system was developed (Rhodes et al., 2008).  This technique made use of a 5â nuclease assay (Taqman) to detect fluorescence in real time upon specific amplification of target DNA. When initially validated laboratory strains and on industrial metal working fluids from the UK and USA from which no M. immunogenum CFU were recovered, the assay detected between 3.4 x101 and 1.9 x 104 cell equivalents (CE) per ml, and increased the detection rate over culture to 37.5% (12 of 32 samples; Rhodes et al., 2008). The initial description of the assay gave an indication as to its potential for routine assessment of coolant samples for contamination with this important organism. However, the true value of the technique will become apparent only after more in depth study and application to industrial systems.

The present report describes further testing of the assay and direct comparison against culture, with its implementation on a larger scale on a range of different contaminated coolant samples obtained from the USA and Europe over a 19 month period (from December 2006 to July 2008)",industry,884,not included

To achieve this goal, it must take into account, among other factors, the design and implementation of new tools that accurately, efficiently and inexpensively allow access to information relevant to process. Soft sensors have been increasingly applied in
industry. Since it offers flexibility, it can be adapted to make estimations of any measurement, thus a reducing in operating costs without compromising the measurements, and in some cases even improve the quality of generated information. Since they are completely softwarebased, they are not subjected to physical damage as the real sensors, and are better adaptated to harsh environments with hard access. The success of this king of sensors is due to the use
of computational intelligence techniques, which have been widely used in the modeling of several nonlinear complex processes. This work aims to estimate the quality of alumina
fluoride from a Gas Treatment Center (GTC), which is the result of gaseous adsorption on
alumina virgin, using a soft sensor. The model that emulates the behavior of a alumina quality sensor the plant was created using an artificial intelligence technique known as Artificial Neural Network. The motivations of this work are: perform virtual simulations without compromising the GTC and make accurate decisions based not only on the operator's experience, to diagnose potential problems before they can interfere with the quality of alumina fluoride; maintain the aluminum reduction pot control variables within normal limits,
since the production from low quality alumina strongly affects the reaction of breaking the molecule that contains this metal. The benefits this project brings include: increasing the GTC efficiency, producing high quality fluoridated alumina and emitting fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and increasing the pot lifespan.FAPESPA - FundaÃ§Ã£o AmazÃ´nia de Amparo a Estudos e PesquisasCVRD - Companhia Vale do Rio DoceAs indÃºstrias tÃªm buscado constantemente reduzir gastos operacionais, visando o aumento do lucro e da competitividade. Para alcanÃ§ar essa meta, sÃ£o necessÃ¡rios, dentre outros fatores, o projeto e a implantaÃ§Ã£o de novas ferramentas que permitam o acesso Ã s informaÃ§Ãµes relevantes do processo de forma precisa, eficiente e barata. Os sensores virtuais tÃªm sido aplicados cada vez mais nas indÃºstrias. Por ser flexÃ­vel, ele pode ser adaptado a qualquer tipo de mediÃ§Ã£o, promovendo uma reduÃ§Ã£o de custos operacionais sem comprometer, e em alguns

Its industrial importance was one of the motivations for this thesis. On-line measurement and monitoring of cultivations of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14945 in a agitated and aerated bioreactor allowed the acquisition of variables such as mol fraction of CO2 and O2 in the exhaust
gases, pH, dissolved oxygen. Batch and fed-batch runs, using either enzymatically hydrolyzed casein or a pool of free amino acids provided information concerning the extend of the cultivation, preservation of the microorganism and addition/exclusion of nutrients. Usual carbon
sources as glucose, fructose and glycerol increased the cellular mass, but did not improve the productivity of PGA. The use of amino acids resulted in a 2.5-fold increase of productivity. Adding phenyl acetic acid at the beginning of the experiments did not inhibit cell growth.
Three non-structured models of microbial growth were put forth, assuming one, two and three limiting substrates. However, these models were too simple for our purposes. Another approach was then followed, using neural networks (NN) as
softsensors. Before implementing the inference algorithm, the blank noise of the instrumentation had to be reduced. A non-conventional filter was developed, combining
a recursive NN, a moving average and a second recursive NN. The smoothed variables were the input for a second NN, for pattern recognition, which classified the run in one of the main growth phases: lag, exponential and stationary. The main purpose of this NN was to identify the exponential phase, which would be the domain of the next NN, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for inference of the cellular mass. Several NN, with
different topologies, were tested for this purpose. Finally, the product concentration (PGA activity in the medium) was estimated through a hybrid approach, using the growth rate inferred by the MLP NN, coupled to the cell-product yield, obtained from the fitting of the non-structured models. Another important information for this last algorithm was the knowledge that production of PGA was growth-associated, but with a 2hr-delay. The algorithm for inference was robust and accurate.Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisA grande importÃ¢ncia da enzima penicilina G acilase (E.C.3.5.1.11), usada para a produÃ§Ã£o dos Ã¡cidos 6-aminopenicilÃ¢nico (6-APA) e 7-aminocefalosporÃ¢nico (7-ACA), compostos-chave na produÃ§Ã£o industrial de antibiÃ³ticos &#946;-lactÃ¢micos, foi a principal motivaÃ§Ã£o deste trabalho. AtravÃ©s de realizaÃ§Ã£o de experimentos de produÃ§Ã£o
de PGA por Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14945 em reator convencional, utilizando sistema de aquisiÃ§Ã£o de dados, foi possÃ­vel monitorar em tempo real variÃ¡veis como, por exemplo, fraÃ§Ã£o molar de oxigÃªnio e diÃ³xido de carbono nos gases de saÃ­da, pH, oxigÃªnio dissolvido. Foram realizados cultivos em batelada e batelada alimentada tendo como
substratos limitantes tanto caseÃ­na hidrolisada enzimaticamente como aminoÃ¡cidos livres. Obtiveram-se informaÃ§Ãµes relacionadas ao tempo de cultivo, Ã  estocagem do microrganismo e Ã  adiÃ§Ã£o e exclusÃ£o de nutrientes. Fontes usuais de carbono, como glicose, lactose e glicerol, quando utilizadas, promoviam o crescimento da massa celular sem, no entanto, aumentar a produÃ§Ã£o de PGA. O uso de aminoÃ¡cidos como principal
substrato elevou em 2,5 vezes a produtividade. Observou-se, ainda, que a adiÃ§Ã£o de Ã¡cido fenilacÃ©tico (AFA) desde o inÃ­cio do cultivo nÃ£o inibiu o crescimento do microrganismo.
As informaÃ§Ãµes experimentais permitiram a proposiÃ§Ã£o e validaÃ§Ã£o de trÃªs modelos cinÃ©ticos nÃ£o-estruturados deste processo, com um ou mais substrato(s) limitante(s). Como essas propostas se mostraram demasiadamente simplificadas, optouse
pelo uso de redes neurais como sensores baseados em  software , jÃ¡ que nÃ£o se chegou a um modelo fenomenolÃ³gico satisfatÃ³rio. Para implementaÃ§Ã£o do algoritmo de inferÃªncia baseado em rede neural,
mostrou-se necessÃ¡rio filtrar os ruÃ­dos das medidas provenientes do sistema de aquisiÃ§Ã£o de forma a minimizar erros aleatÃ³rios da instrumentaÃ§Ã£o. PropÃµe-se para isso filtro que utiliza redes recorrentes, combinadas a mÃ©dia mÃ³vel. As variÃ¡veis filtradas foram utilizadas numa segunda rede de identificaÃ§Ã£o de padrÃµes, que dividia o cultivo nas trÃªs principais fases do crescimento microbiano. O principal objetivo desta foi
identificar a fase de crescimento exponencial, que seria a enfocada pelo algoritmo de inferÃªncia. Para essa inferÃªncia, com base nas variÃ¡veis medidas em tempo real, treinaram-se redes com vÃ¡rias topologias e entradas, de modo a escolher as variÃ¡veis que possibilitassem o aprendizado dos aspectos essenciais da dinÃ¢mica do processo.
Por fim, a concentraÃ§Ã£o de produto (atividade de PGA no meio de cultura) foi estimada atravÃ©s de enfoque hÃ­brido, usando a velocidade de crescimento inferida por rede  feedforward , acoplada ao fator de rendimento cÃ©lula-produto estimado no ajuste dos modelos nÃ£o-estruturados. Outra informaÃ§Ã£o importante utilizada neste Ãºltimo
algoritmo foi o fato da produÃ§Ã£o ser associada ao crescimento, mas com atraso de 2h. Novamente, os resultados quantitativos do algoritmo de inferÃªncia do produto foram muito satisfatÃ³rios",industry,886,not included

Nelle tre differenti aggettivazioni Ã¨ racchiuso uno dei mandati della Tecnologia e della relativa Cultura tecnologica progettuale da sviluppare nel prossimo futuro: la richiesta di sostenibilitÃ  del fare umano per le generazioni future (Sustainable), di soliditÃ  e affidabilitÃ  dei comportamenti e delle prestazioni (Nachhaltige), di durabilitÃ  nel tempo dei prodotti delle trasformazioni (Durable).

L'altro grande mandato della Cultura tecnologica nella nostra epoca Ã¨ quello di offrire non solo risposte 'dinamiche' nella dimensione temporale di medio-lungo termine alle crescenti esigenze di sostenibilitÃ /affidabilitÃ /durabilitÃ , ma anche risposte 'dinamiche' nello spazio reale e nel tempo presente e di breve termine supportando l'Architettura nella sua altrettanto assoluta necessitÃ  di essere 'adattiva' e 'resiliente' ai cambiamenti giÃ  in atto sul piano climatico e ambientale.

Cultura tecnologica significa dunque profonda consapevolezza degli obiettivi da perseguire progettualmente, indissolubilmente legata ad un'attitudine alla visione sistemica dei problemi, ad un'impostazione metodologica delle strategie da tracciare e promuovere, ad un'intima sapienza degli aspetti di fattibilitÃ  e realizzabilitÃ  delle azioni da sperimentare, monitorare, consolidare nel tempo.

D'altra parte tutti i maggiori centri di ricerca e sperimentazione dell'area dell'Architettura nei Paesi avanzati pongono quale nodo focale dei processi di concezione, progettazione e realizzazione di qualsiasi tipo di intervento trasformativo delle nostre realtÃ  quello caratterizzato dall'approccio tecnologico, in cui nei diversi contesti la Architectural Technology, la Baukonstruktion, la Technologie de l'Architecture, la ConstrucciÃ³n en Arquitectura non rappresentano solo un ambito disciplinare (pealtro da sempre a vocazione fortemente interdisciplinare) ma, di piÃ¹, la dimensione logica e culturale nella quale si coordinano e ruotano le complesse declinazioni e i differenti caratteri del progetto.

Nel rinvenire gli elementi di innovazione propri della Cultura tecnologica nell'approcciare e sviluppare ricerca e sperimentazione sui temi dell'ambiente e dell'energia vi Ã¨ in primis la capacitÃ  di perseguire al contempo tre categorie di obiettivi ""alti"" prestazionali: efficienza delle azioni nel controllarne rendimenti e risultati; efficacia complessiva delle strategie nel verificarne il rapporto tra efficienza conseguita e quantitÃ  di risorse coinvolte e impiegate nei processi per raggiungere quei risultati; soddisfazione degli utenti nel vivere quelle condizioni di efficienza e nel percepire o addirittura esser coinvolti in quelle dimensioni di efficacia.

La concezione innovativa di scenario che Ã¨ aperta dall'evoluzione del significato di efficacia pone in primo piano la questione della 'scarsitÃ  di risorse' e tiene in massima considerazione -fino al punto di farla sua nei recenti sviluppi a piÃ¹ ancora in quelli a venire nel prossimo futuro - l'accezione di 'Economia circolare' (asse portante della visione della Green Economy) che, secondo il recentissimo Piano di Azione Globale della ComunitÃ  Europea, attiene ad un sistema complesso in cui ""il valore dei prodotti, dei materiali, dell'energia e delle risorse Ã¨ mantenuto quanto piÃ¹ a lungo possibile e la produzione di emissioni, inquinamento, scarti e rifiuti Ã¨ ridotta al massimo"" (European Commission, 2017) e in cui, secondo il report della Agenzia Europea per l'Ambiente, centrale Ã¨ ""contrastare il depauperamento delle risorse naturali, re-immettere nel mercato le risorse in dismissione ed agevolare il recupero delle risorse di valore"" (European Environment Agency, 2016).

In questo senso protagonista assoluto di tale innovazione Ã¨ quell'approccio ecosistemico ai problemi, alle questioni in gioco e alle strategie ed azioni per risolverli, che fa fondamentalmente riferimento alla visione di tipo 'Life Cycle' strutturante il senso stesso di 'sostenibilitÃ ' di uno sviluppo capace di sostanziare la 'circolaritÃ ' del sistema economico, la 'mitigabilitÃ ' della crisi climatica, l''efficientabilitÃ ' della questione energetica, la 'capitalizzabilitÃ ' del patrimonio naturale, la 'inclusivitÃ ' del benessere e la 'rigenerabilitÃ ' delle cittÃ ; e di includere il concetto di 'Costo ambientale' in tutte le strategie e azioni da questi assi sottese.The role of technological culture in planning, seen in light of the three major challenges raised by the environmental and energy-related issues of our time, meaning climate change, limited resources and excessive energy consumption, is a key role, and one that we ignore at our peril when it comes to seeking out, in informed fashion, a renewal in the conditions of inhabiting the contexts of Europe and the rest of the world, a quest that necessarily brings into play concepts which differ with respect to their terminology, but yet prove quite similar when it comes to the board range of concepts covered and the wealth of their underlying objectives: Sustainable Development, Nachhaltige Entwicklung and DÃ©vÃ©loppement Durable.

Ensconced within each of these descriptors is one of the vital tasks that technology and the related cultural of technology must fulfil in the near future: responding to the request for sustainability in human  endeavours in future generations (Sustainable), as well as for integrity and reliability in terms of conduct and performance (Nachhaltige), together with the durability over time of the products of transformations (Durable).

The other major task of cultural technology in our time is to provide responses that prove 'dynamic' not only over the medium-long term, with respect to meeting the growing need for sustainability/reliability /durability, but that are also 'dynamic' within real space and at the present time, in the short term, supporting architectureâs equally absolute need to be 'adaptable' and 'resilient' in response to changes currently affecting the climate and the environment.

Technological culture, therefore, means possessing a thoroughgoing knowledge of the objectives to be pursued through planning, irrevocably linked to a leaning towards a systemic vision of issues, as well as a methodological approach to the strategies to be outline and promoted, plus an intimate familiarity with the considerations of feasibility and practicality tied to the initiatives to be tested, monitored and built up over time.

For that matter, all the major centres of research and experimentation in the architectural sectors of the developed countries posit the technological approach as a vital factor in the processes of conceptualisation, planning and implementation of any type of initiative meant to transform our existing realties, with the result that the various contexts of Architectural Technology, Baukonstruktion, Technologie de l'Architecture and ConstrucciÃ³n en Arquitectura represent not only a disciplinary realm (albeit one with a marked interdisciplinary bent) but, even more to the point, the logical and cultural dimension within which the various manifestations and characteristics of planning are coordinated and brought into focus.

In identifying the innovative features displayed by technological culture as it addresses and develops research and experimentation on environmental and energy-related topics, the first observation to be made is its ability to simultaneously pursue three different categories of ""advanced"" objectives involving performance: the efficiency of initiatives in terms of controlling yields and results; the overall effectiveness of strategies in light of assessments of the ratio between the efficiency achieved and the quantities of resources involved and utilised in the processes enacted to reach those results; the satisfaction of the users of those conditions of efficiency as they perceive, or even become involved in, the new dimensions of effectiveness.

The innovative approach to conceptualisation of scenarios brought about by the evolution in the meaning of effectiveness highlights the issue of 'scarce resources' while placing the utmost importance â to the point of absorbing it in recent developments, a trend that shall become even more pronounced in the near future â on the framework of the 'Circular Economy' outlook (a cornerstone of the vision of a Green Economy), an outlook that, according to the recent Global Action Plan of the European  Community, points to a complex system in which, ""The value of products, materials, energy and resources is maintained for as long as possible, while the production of emissions, pollution, scrap and waste is reduced to the greatest possible extent"" (European Commission, 2017), with key importance placed on, ""Contrasting the impoverishment of natural resources, reintroducing discarded resources onto the market and facilitating the recovery of resources of value "" (European Environment Agency, 2016).

Seen in this light, the key ingredient to a similar innovation is the eco-systemic approach taken to the problems and issues addressed, as well as to the strategies and initiatives enacted to resolve them, an outlook that essentially consists of a 'Life Cycle' vision able to provide the structure for the fundamental 'sustainability' of a mode of development that succeeds in supporting the 'circularity' of the economic system, together with the potential for mitigating the climate crisis, for increasing energy efficiency, for capitalising on natural resources, for making wellbeing more inclusive while regenerating cities, with the concept of 'environmental cost' becoming an integral part of all the strategies and actions underlying such efforts",smart cities,889,not included

The first year was granted and till now very good results has been obtained and published in an international journal (SCIE indexed). In this proposal, we revise according to the reviewersâ comments (cf. Table C012-2). We also include the results descriptions of the first year execution and present how/what we have prepared for the following two years wishing that the research can be continued. Since IEEE 802.16 WiMax wireless networks are developed, it becomes the future infrastructure of many developed and developing countries. New related standards and their amendments are fervidly discussed. The IEEE 802.16e-2005 has defined Mobile WiMax and the latest drafting 802.16j and the âpre-draftingâ 802.16m even try to respectively promote multi-hop relay and mobility beyond the original throughput. In these finalized, drafting, and pre-drafting standards, most are about Media Access Control (MAC) and PHYsical layers (PHY). What insights are with Quality of Service (QoS) and we see that QoS is a problem relating not only upper layers but also MAC and PHY. Especially for WiMax, QoS realization in MAC and PHY are emphasized by many researches. Inheriting the experiences of previous projects since IEEE 802.11e EDCA, HCCA, and currently the general TDMA-based QoS controls, we propose the following researches to strike into IEEE 802.16e/j Wave 2 and so as into general Scalable OFDMA (SOFDMA) based QoS control: 1. Define Hierarchical Cross-Layer Control (HCLC) for 802.16e/j/m mobile and multi-hop relay QoS 2. Study Generalized Fuzzy Automata (GFA) defined with high-type and high-level fuzzy universes over lattices to mathematically realize WiMax behaviors and characteristics 3. Design HCLC scheduler and allocator (together called controller) according to the GFA theory where high-type fuzzy universes are used for multi-parameter and multi-objective control. In this way, we can adjust QoS parameters while the wireless communications are still compatible with the standards.4. Perform HCLC software-hardware co-design, implement the MAC QoS controller Silicon Intellectual Property (SIP), and its Electronic System Level (ESL) verifications. Develop WiMax verification platform with cross-layer features that modern instruments cannot measure. 5. Research generic cross-layer control for the OFDM/Scalable OFDMA-based wireless such that we can extend the WiMax QoS control research into future standards such as IEEE 802.22 Cognitive Radio and IEEE 802.11n MIMO. This project extends the valuable results of previous executed/executing projects. Beside cross-layer, and beside defined power sleep behaviors (Listen/Active) and ranging, we also consider energy consumption about routing control, PDU length, and scheduling computation. These are what the IEEE 802.16 does not define. Unlike those hard computation algorithms using optimization theory, we explain the feasibility using soft computing. Beside the reason explained in the Computational Intelligence Magazine published by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) that one of the emergent applications of soft computing is network control, we additionally and in detail defined problems of WiMax QoS control. In this proposal we explain why wireless networks cannot be modeled by fixed probability model and why their performances cannot be derived using fixed environmental factors. Consequently, optimization using hard computing algorithms can not express objective functions in terms of constraints and control parameters. However, using soft computing we still suffer difficulties. The variables and states of wireless networks forms a large and dynamic space such at that no expertise can define detail fuzzy rules. Therefore, in this project, we try to use simple fuzzy rules distributed in different protocol layers. Expanding the rules in the protocol layers, we found that the number of fuzzy rules exponentially grows along the number of layers. We adopt homomorphism concept to explain and constrain inter-layer states and variables. We called this network control architecture the Hierarchical Cross-Layer Control (HCLC). For WiMax, this project analyses the relationship between delay and QoS parameters when network is highly dynamic. Then, we use generalized fuzzy automata to realize the behavior of the WiMax network and integrate energy consumption model. The realization of automata (output function) inherits previous projectsâ results â the one dimensional HCLC control to extend new SOFDMA-based control with multiple objectives and multiple parameters. The method used is adopting high-type and high-level fuzzy universes in the HCLC. We even find out that such HCLC architecture is a more generic paradigm than defined in so-called Hierarchical Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy control. This project will analyze the stability and efficiency of this fuzzy control architecture. In the first half year, we design the experiment to prove that HCLC efficiently and effectively perform IEEE 802.16e/j QoS control while at the same time keep the fairness that few articles concern. Considering the embedded system design, silicon intellectual property implementation, and verification of the WiMax QoS controller, this project provides a low cost solution. According to known SoC design flow, no SIP verification platform can perform verification of SIP behavior under realistic wireless network environment before accomplishment of SoC integration, tapering, and embedded software porting. Itâs a long journey to accomplish all these tasks. If a bug is found in the SIP, no EDA tool can remove it dedicatedly for network communication. Even using costly SoC verification tool such as ARM-based platform with AMBA SoC bus on the PCB, we still cannot observe the SIP behavior under wireless networks. Using costly SoC verification tool, what only we can do is signal wave measurement, observation and control at the instruction and cycle accuracy. For basic networking experiments, we still even have to replicate platforms to construct the basic network topology. After we success eventually, the market opportunity is gone. This is a tuff work for design houses. The verification platform of this project will be superior over traditional ones and obviously shorten the development of networking SIPs. Thus reduce the cost effectively. In previous project, we had accomplished WLAN MANET ESL verification where HCLC control model successfully cooperates with FPGA hardware. This is the ever first verification platform that verify behaviours of real hardware and cross-layer algorithm under MANET. The platform will be extended for WiMAX MMR since it optimally match hardware architecture and cross-layer algorithms and is the best tool for hardware/software co-design. According to the above descriptions, we project three-year research methods, steps, and objectives. Based on the concept that research should be always continuing and burrowing to the deep, we follow the direction of previous research projects. In the first half year, we already accomplished high-type HCLC control model and its cross-layer scheduler software component for OFDMA-based 802.16e/j Mobile Multi-hop Relay (MMR) WiMax. In the second year, we will extend the HCLC controller to 802.16j/m and integrate energy consumption model to accomplish embedded cross-layer scheduler software component for multi-hop relaying and mobile WiMax. In the third year, we will implement the OFDMA-based WiMax scheduler and its electronic system level (ESL) verification platform. Summarizing the originality and features, we have: first, the system and QoS SIP not only guarantee QoS but also intra- and inter-class fairness; sencond, the QoS and fairness guarantees are energy-aware; third, we accomplish HCLC SIP for general WiMax; fourth, we produce low cost ESL verification platform integrating the network simulator and hierarchical cross-layer control. For future extension, fuzzy automata theory applies in many areas such as machine learning, intelligent network state space learning, and cross-layer physical layer modulation for spectrum optimization. The resulting SIP verification platform is also useful in many cases in addition to SIP and MAC layer control. For example, it should be also useful in any cross-layer algorithms, embedded system algorithms, â¦, etc. This project covers several research fields including artificial intelligence, computing theory, communication networks, and VLSI. With the basis of previous successful projects, we progress toward system integration and the results will also be very plentiful and valuable.[[note]]NSC98-2221-E327-02",smart cities,890,not included

The views and conclusions contained herein are the authorâs and shouldnât be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of other parties.The Collaborative Operations for Personnel Recovery (Co-OPR) project sought to
provide collaborative task support for a Search and Rescue coordination center. The
project aimed to create a prototype âPersonnel Recovery (Experimental) Packâ (PREP) and to demonstrate its use.

A number of requirements capture, knowledge gathering and transition workshops and
meetings were held. This included an initial requirements setting workshop early in 2005,
meetings at the USJFCOM Joint Personnel Recovery Agencyâs (JPRA) Personnel
Recovery Education and Training Center (PRETC) in Fredericksburg, Virginia in June
2005, a review meeting in Edinburgh in August 2005, and attendance at a Command Post
Exercise (CPX) at the PRETC in November 2005. These initially established the potential
areas for use of Co-OPR and I-X tools in training exercises. In the second project year such tools were developed and tested using a training exercise as held at the PRETC, using observers from PRETC and USJFCOM and an evaluation expert from USJFCOM/J9.

The project was provided with a rich set of urban and rural scenarios by JPRA/PRETC
which together are unclassified versions of scenarios used within the PRETC training
courses and Command Post Exercises. At the time, these stretched the capabilities of the
current and envisaged technologies within Co-OPR/I-X. Refinement of the scenarios
alongside PRETC, and knowledge engineering to capture information on standard operating procedures and responses were a key part of making the work relevant to the potential real use of Co-OPR/I-X for Personnel Recovery.

The core I-X technology was packaged into a number of checkpoint releases to make
available the features required to meet the application needs. I-X version 4.3 released in November 2005 to checkpoint the results achieved on the first 12 months of work with
the PRETC. It formed a basis for the work on really using the technology at the PRETC.
New âwhite cellâ aids for training were made available in an initial version. A new I-Sim
simulation capability, and advanced option exploration tools have all been improved
significantly to make them more usable, including the features of the I-Plan AI planner and its capability for plan repair after failures. The features of the Domain Editor (I-DE) and its ability to browse and update or augment standard operating procedure knowledge dynamically during missions were enhanced. The final release of I-X that includes all the new developments achieved in the Co-OPR project is version 4.5.

The results of the work were packaged, along with Personnel Recovery domain specific
models, as a web site and/or CD which could be considered as a prototype âPersonnel
Recovery (Experimental) Packâ of tools to assist a Joint Personnel Recovery Center
(JPRC) and associated operational staff in performing their operations. The versions of
PREP produced were used in one workshop or Command Post Exercise at the PRETC
under guidance from Dr. Jeff Hansberger at training related workshops already organized
by USJFCOM/J9 Expt. and Fred Kleibacker, the (now former) Director of the PRETC in
Fredericksburg, Virginia. Co-OPR team members were engaged with these workshops to
to show the tools in realistic settings, to assist with training where possible, and to gather experimental feedback.

Realistic use of tools for Personnel Recovery requires that the systems can work with
emerging technology for geo-positioning, survival radios, evasion aids, robotic or semiautomated rescue aids or robots, and doctrine or tactics, techniques and procedures for Personnel Recovery. A number of short studies of these âcomplementary technologiesâ were made which explored deployment and inter-working aspects of these with the Co-OPR/I-X technology",smart cities,891,not included

In particular, the technology for simultaneous presentation of virtual objects to multiple users through space sharing is important for applications such as product demonstrations, design meetings, surgical support, or competitive games. However, such space-sharing technology alone can share virtual objects in the same space, but it cannot share remote objects as virtual objects with each other.In this research, as a proposal for the use of technology to mutually share remote objects as virtual objects, I will develop an AR game system that can communicate and compete with each other in the same way as real competitive games even in remote areas, by using a 360-degree omni-directional laser scanner to acquire the position and posture of a real radio-controlled car in each user\u27s space, and using network communication technology to mutually share this information and reproduce it as a virtual object in real time",multimedia,892,not included

We present tasks of increasing complexity leading to a combination of 3-D (re)orientation and landing locomotion behaviors of a quadruped robot traversing simulated low-gravity celestial bodies. We show that our approach easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each case. Using sim-to-real transfer, we deploy trained policies in the real world on the SpaceBok robot placed on an experimental testbed designed for 2-D microgravity experiments.

On the one hand, it considers the study of trust relationships towards the ""non-human agents"" that are the contemporary technological tools (algorithms and data that define artificial intelligence); on the other hand, it undertakes to conceptualize the authority that these tools are acquiring. The starting point is that the contemporary deployment of AI relies on forms of trust in machines shared between their designers and users, who appear to be the ""cement"" of the uses that guarantee the efficiency of the machines. However, this trust is less directed towards tools considered as neutral than towards personalized or even personified entities. Artificial intelligences, analyzed in the context of their uses, are already presented as something other than neutral instruments. Although still poorly qualified ontologically, they are already no longer simple tools, but agents. Through the services they render and the influence they already exert on behaviors, they acquire a real action that needs to be documented and conceptualized. This approach in political philosophy wants to examine the form of authority thus generated, notably by imagining experimental devices to test the hypotheses.Cette contribution se donne deux objectifs. D'une part, elle envisage l'Ã©tude des relations de confiance envers les Â« agents non-humains Â» que sont les outils technologiques contemporains (algorithmes et donnÃ©es qui dÃ©finissent l'intelligence artificielle) ; de l'autre, elle entreprend de conceptualiser l'autoritÃ© que ces outils sont en train d'acquÃ©rir.

Or cette confiance s'adresse moins Ã  des outils considÃ©rÃ©s comme neutres qu'Ã  des entitÃ©s personnalisÃ©es voire personnifiÃ©es.

If we see a single object or hear a particular sound, we are then able to recognize such sample or even different versions of it in other scenarios. As an example, if one sees a iron chair and associates the object to the general concept of ""chairs"", he will be able to detect and recognize also wooden or wicker chairs. Similarly, when we hear the sound of a particular event, such as a scream, we are then able to recognize other kinds of scream that occur in different environments. We continuously learn representations of the real world, which we then use in order to understand new and changing environments.In the field of pattern recognition, traditional methods typically require a careful design of data representations (i.e. features), which involves considerable domain knowledge and effort by experts. Recently, approaches for automated learning of representations from training data were introduced and based on popular deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Representation learning aims at avoiding engineering of hand-crafted features and providing automatically learned features suitable for the recognition tasks. In this work, we proposed novel trainable filters for representation learning in audio and image processing. The structure of these filters is not fixed in the implementation but rather configured directly from single prototype patterns of interest [4].In the context of audio processing, we focused on the problem of audio event detection and classification in noisy environments, also in cases where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is null or negative. We released two data sets, namely the MIVIA audio events and the MIVIA road events data sets, and obtained baseline results (recognition rate of about 85%) with a real-time method for event detection based on the bag of features classification scheme [3, 2].We designed novel trainable feature extractors, which we call COPE (Combination of Peaks of Energy), that are able to detect specific constellations of energy peak points in time-frequency representations of input audio signals [8]. The particular constellation of energy peaks to be detected by a COPE feature extractor is determined in an automatic configuration process performed on a given prototype sound. The design of COPE feature extractors was inspired by some functions of the cochlea membrane and the inner hair cells in the inner auditory system, which convert the sound pressure waves into neural stimuli on the auditory nerve.We proposed a method that uses COPE feature extractors together with a classification system to perform real-time audio event detection and classification, also in cases where sounds have null and negative SNR. The performance results (recognition rate over 90%) that we obtained on several benchmarking data sets for audio events detection in different contexts are higher than state-of-the-art approaches.In the second part of the work, we introduced B-COSFIRE filters for detection of elongated and curvilinear patterns in images and apply them to the delineation of blood vessels in retinal images [1, 6]. The B-COSFIRE filters are trainable, that is their structure is automatically configured from prototype elongated patterns. The design of the B-COSFIRE filters is inspired by the functions of some neurons, called simple cells, in area V1 of the visual system, which fire when presented with line or contour stimuli. A B-COSFIRE filter achieves orientation selectivity by computing the weighted geometric mean of the output of a pool of Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filters, whose supports are aligned in a collinear manner. Rotation invariance is efficiently obtained by appropriate shiftings of the DoG filter responses.After configuring a large bank of B-COSFIRE filters selective for vessels (i.e. lines) and vessel-endings (i.e. line-endings) of various thickness (i.e. scale), we employed different techniques based on information theory and machine learning to select an optimal subset of B-COSFIRE filters for the vessel delineation task [5, 7]. We considered the selected filters as feature extractors to construct a pixel-wise feature vector which we used in combination with a classifier to classify the pixels in the testing image as vessel and non-vessel pixels. We carried out experiments on public benchmarking data sets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE DB1 and HRF data sets) and the results that we achieved are higher than many existing methods.We studied the computational requirements of the proposed algorithms in order to evaluate their applicabilityin real-world applications and the fulfillment of real-time constraints given by the considered problems. The MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithms are publicly released for research purposes.This work contributes to the development of algorithms for representation learning in audio and imageprocessing and promotes their use in higher-level pattern recognition systems",multimedia,896,not included

The internet of industrial objects (IIoT) is part of a larger concept known as the ""Internet of Things (IoT)"". IoT's bring new opportunities to production sites such as lower operating costs and increased productivity for optimal operation. The application of IoT to the manufacturing industry is called IIoT (or Industrial Internet or Industry 4.0). The IoT will revolutionize manufacturing by enabling the acquisition and accessibility of massive amounts of data at much higher speeds and far more efficiently than before. A few innovative companies have started to implement IoT by exploiting smart connected devices in their factories (so-called smart factories or Industry 4.0). From a data acquisition perspective, the Internet of Things has favoured the inclusion of subsystems and their analysis in real time. To achieve this, Industry 4.0 introduces a digitized production concept by allowing flexible and agile integration of new business models while keeping manufacturing costs and efficiency at a reasonable level. In this thesis, we will study the predictive maintenance for industry 4.0. This method of preventing asset failure by analyzing production data to identify patterns and predict issues before they happen. However, considering the costs, it is wise to strike a better balance between routine preventative maintenance and corrective maintenance. Facility monitoring helps to reduce the level of preventative maintenance. In this context, vibration analysis is a tool for detecting and then diagnosing malfunctions of installations. Also, after describing the main vibratory manifestations of failures of the machines, we will examine the detection and surveillance strategies at the time and frequency domain and the diagnosis process based on artificial intelligence by analyzing the vibratory signals. Our main objective is to design a system that will analyze the vibrating signals of a rotating machine in the time/frequency domain. A machine learning system will be used to detect and classify the defects based on artificial intelligence algorithms. The application aims to provide a reliable fault detection system to reduce repair times and promote rapid diagnosis of industrial operations. Therefore, the project goes from the design to the implementation of new algorithms using vibratory signals. An optimization process will be implemented when the decisions of the adequate staff are made to increase the efficiency of the results and reduce the risk situations that will put the machines out of use. Therefore, this research project will introduce an intelligent system into an industry 4.0 production environment. During this research project, firstly, we will implement algorithms that allowed us to extract characteristics of the vibration signals and set up a system to monitor the state of a rotating machine by setting a threshold of operation and trigger an alarm when this threshold is reached. In a second step, we will use signal processing and machine learning toolkits to classify the different levels of machine failure and use this method to detect the presence of error when the machine is running. After extracting the characteristics of our signals at the time and frequency domain, we will be obtained with the ""cross-validation"" a recognition rate of 99.3%. The final implementation with the ""holdout validation"" recommended for large datasets allowed us to have a classification rate of 100% of the different levels of defects considered",multimedia,901,not included

consciousness, free will, and intentionality. As computer-based personality
judgments are more accurate than those made by humans, digital me can judge the

social quality, g) practical immortality. We argue that with the advancement of
AI's sciences and technologies, there exist two digital me thresholds. The
first threshold defines digital me having some (rudimentarily) form of
consciousness, free will, and intentionality. The second threshold assumes that
digital me is equipped with moral learning capabilities, implying that, in

Concerning the reliability of surface texture, we leveraged the contour

Drone perching, being closely linked to applications stated above, has also begun to emerge. This research would allow the drones to realize new tasks but also to mitigate their disadvantages such as their short flight time or their fragility. Current perching and object grasping approaches are carried out by utilizing artificial vision and robotic grippers integrated with the drones. The target objects or their handles are chosen in a way to match the geometry of the gripper. Thus, in case where supports have complex form or dimensions too differents in comparison with gripper dimensions, perching won't be avaiblable. The purpose of this study is to develop a detection system that uses computer vision to return ideal support for drone perching. The ideal support corresponds to the object with the best matching score. The matching score, that we have developed and called ""CSP"" (Concordance Support-PrÃ©henseur) in this study, is determined from the comparison between the gripper opening and the real object dimension. The implementation of this comparison as well as the utilization of matching score to the determination of the best support is a method that we created. The suggested solution in this study is based on a detection algorithm which uses the classification and segmentation of objects. The several stages of the uses method are enumerated as follows : 1. Supervised training of neural network detection algorithm for new objects classes adapted to drone perching. 2. Conception of an algorithm, allowing to realize a comparison between object dimensions and grasping system dimensions in order to determine the ideal support. 3. Evaluation of the global system performances thanks to tests performed on a set of objects. This evaluation has shown the precision and the reliability of our system in the ideal support determination based on artificial vision. We used a set of 36 tests with, for each test, different parameter values and different environmental conditions. Moreover, each test has been performed with a number of 10 repetitions for a given configuration in the purpose to obtain more reliable results. These tests have been made using a camera with a resolution of 640 x 480 and a graphic processor unit GTX 1080Ti (GPU). The global performance of our system obtains a success rate of 84.17 % in the ideal support determination. This success rate even reaches 100 % in the case where the difference between the diameter of each object is at least 20 mm. The execution speed of this model, with only one detected object by image, takes on average 0.42 second for the analysis of one image, which corresponds to 2.38 fps. To maintain fluidity and thus to avoid wrong detections and/or segmentations during camera motion, an efficient execution time is needed in the treatment of each object",multimedia,917,not included

One area of all games which is critical to the success of the game is that of game balance and tuning. These balancing initiatives cut across all areas of code from the player and AI to the mission manager. In computer science, weâve come to call these types of concerns âcross cuttingâ. Aspect oriented programming was developed, in part, to solve the problems of cross cutting: employing âadviceâ which can be incorporated across different pieces of functionality.
Yet, despite the prevalence of a solution, very little work has been done to bring cross cutting to game engine programming. Additionally, the discipline involves a heavy amount of code rewriting and reuse while simultaneously relying on many common design patterns that are copied from one project to another. In the case of game balance, the code may be wildly different across two different games despite the fact that similar tasks are being done. These two problems are exacerbated by the fact that almost every game engine has its own custom DSL (domain specific language) unique to that situation. If a DSL could showcase the areas of cross cutting concerns while highlighting the ability to capture design patterns that can be used across games, significant productivity savings could be achieved while simultaneously creating a common thread for discussion of shared problems within the domain.
This dissertation sought to do exactly that- create a metalanguage called GAMESPECT which supports multiple styles of DSLs while bringing aspect-oriented programming into the DSLâs to make them DSAL (domain specific aspect languages). The example cross cutting concern was game balance and tuning since itâs so pervasive and important to gaming. We have created GAMESPECT as a language and a composition framework which can assist engine developers and game designers in balancing their games, forming one central place for game balancing concerns even while these concerns may cross different languages and locations inside the source code. Generality was measured by showcasing the composition specifications in multiple contexts and languages.
In addition to evaluating generality and performance metrics, effectiveness was be measured. Specifically, comparisons were made between a balancing initiative when performed with GAMESPECT vs a traditional methodology. In doing so, this work shows a clear advantage to using a Metalanguage such as GAMESPECT for this task. In general, a line of code reduction of 9-40% per task was achieved with negligible effects to performance. The use of a metalanguage in Unreal Engine 4 is a starting point to further discussions concerning other game engines. In addition, this work has implications beyond video game programming. The work described highlights benefits which might be achieved in other disciplines where design pattern implementations and cross-cutting concern usage is high; the real time simulation field and the field of Windows GUI programming are two examples of future domains",multimedia,918,not included

and learn representations of the scene that are more robust and adaptive to several nuisance

factors. Over the recent past, for a variety of tasks involving images, learned representations  have been empirically shown to outperform handcrafted ones.

However, their inability to generalize across varying data distributions poses the following

question: Do representations learned using deep networks just fit a given data distribution or do

they sufficiently model the underlying structure of the problem ? This question could be

understood using a simple example: If a learning algorithm is shown a number of images of a simple handwritten digit, then the representation learned should be generic enough to identify the same digit in

a different form. With regards to deep networks, although the learned representation has been shown

to be robust to various forms of synthetic distortions such as random noise, they fail in the presence of

more implicit forms of naturally occurring distortions. In this dissertation, we

propose approaches to mitigate the effect of such distortions and in the process, study some

vulnerabilities of deep networks to small imperceptible changes that occur in the given input.

The research problems that comprise this dissertation lie in the cross section of two open topics: (1)

Studying and developing methods that enable neural networks learn robust representations (2) Improving

generalization of neural nets across domains.  The first part of the dissertation  approaches the problem of robustness from two broad viewpoints:  Robustness to external nuisance factors that occur in the data and robustness

(or a lack thereof) to perturbations of the learned feature space.  In the second part, we focus on learning representations that are invariant to external covariate

shift, which is more commonly termed as domain shift. 

Towards learning representations robust

to external nuisance factors, we propose an approach that couples a deep convolutional neural

network with a low-dimensional discriminative embedding learned using triplet probability

constraints to solve the unconstrained face analysis problem. While previous approaches in this area have proposed scalable yet ad-hoc solutions to this problem, we propose a principled and parameter free formulation which is based on maximum likelihood estimation. In addition, we employ the principle of transfer learning to realize a deep network architecture that can train faster and on lesser data yet significantly outperforms existing approaches on the unconstrained face verification task. We demonstrate the robustness

of the approach to challenges including age, pose, blur and clutter by performing clustering

experiments on challenging benchmarks.

Recent seminal works have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to visually imperceptible perturbations of the input. In this dissertation, we build on their ideas in two unique ways: (a) We show that neural networks that perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation tasks also suffer from this vulnerability, despite being trained with more extra information compares to simple classification tasks.  In addition, we present a novel self correcting mechanism in segmentation networks and provide an efficient way to generate such perturbations (b) We present a novel approach to regularize deep neural networks by perturbing intermediate layer activations in an efficient manner, thereby exploring the trade-off between conventional regularization and adversarial robustness within the context of very deep networks. Both of these works provide interesting directions towards understanding the secure nature of deep learning algorithms. 

While humans find it extremely simple to generalize their knowledge across domains, machine learning algorithms including deep neural networks suffer from the problem of domain shift across what are commonly termed as 'source' (S) 

and 'target' (T) distributions. Let the data that a learning algorithm

is trained on be sampled from  S. If the real data used to evaluate the model is

then sampled from T, then the learnt model under-performs on the target data. This inability to generalize is characterized as domain shift. 

Our attempt to address this problem involves learning a common

feature subspace, where distance between source and target distributions are minimized. Estimating the distance between different domains is highly non-trivial and is an open research

problem in itself. In our approach we parameterize the distance measure by using a Generative

Adversarial Network (GAN). A GAN involves a two player game between two mappings com-

monly termed as generator and discriminator. These mappings are learned simultaneously by

employing an adversarial game, i.e. by letting the generator fool the discriminator and enabling

the discriminator to outperform the generator. This adversarial game can be formulated as a

minimax problem. In our approach, we learn three mappings simultaneously: the generator,

discriminator and a feature mapping that contains information about both the content and the

domain of the input. We deploy a two-level minimax game, where the first level is a competition

between the generator and a discriminator similar to a GAN; the second level game is where the

feature mapping attempts to fool the discriminator thereby introducing domain invariance in

the learned feature representation. We have extensively evaluated this approach for different

tasks such as object classification and semantic segmentation, where we achieve state of the

art results across several real datasets. In addition to the conceptual novelty, our approach

presents a more efficient and scalable solution compared to other approaches that attempt to

solve the same problem.

In the final part of this dissertation, we describe some ongoing efforts and future directions of research. Inspired from the study of perturbations described above, we propose a novel metric on how to effectively choose pixels to label given an image, for a pixel-wise segmentation task. This has the potential to significantly reduce the labeling effort and our preliminary results for the task of semantic segmentation are encouraging.  While the domain adaptation approach proposed above considered static images, we propose an extension to video data aided by the use of recurrent neural networks.

The application of this method results in a representative index of the actual exposure to the occupational noise of workers whose activities present a great variation of the average noise levels when computed on a daily basis. This index shall, named normalized level of noncontinuous exposure, enable the implementation of more effective actions in the prevention of auditory damages associated to noise and a more accurate treatment than the current one in relation to the legal benefits for certain professional categories, such as carpenters, undertaker, masons, etc. The proposed method is based on the principle of equivalent energy. According to this principle, the sound energy is the only responsible for the development of auditory damages induced by noise (PAIRs) in a population exposed to noise, so that the type of noise and its daily duration do not interfere in the auditory damage process. This assumption, already adopted by the international standard ISO 1999 (1990), allowed the establishment of a statistical relation between the continuous exposure and the auditory damages caused by noise. ln this work, using other assumptions, the principle of equal energy for noncontinuous exposures is included, allowing the estimates of auditory damages also caused in environments with great variation of sound levels. The results of the proposed method are related by the effectiveness of causing auditory damages, that is, the damages caused by the noise originated from noncontinuous exposure are expressed herein by a normalized exposure level (NEN) of continuous exposure. In this work the proposed method on two groups of professionals in the Civil Construction is also applied: general assistants and carpenters, for whom the exposure to noise was evaluated and the distribution of  PAIRs was determined. The method results were compared to the actual labor conditions in the work sites observed through examinations of the productive process and quantitative evaluations of the sound exposure of each group studied, with the purpose of studying the consistency between the results of the proposed method ai:1d the field results.

The existing approaches typically need a low-level information from the input video stream but the environment factors (indoor light, outdoor light) affect the results. The use of a predefined model allows to avoid this since the data is naturally filtered. Experiments on different input video streams demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient for solving the tracking of moving objects in input streams in real time because it needs less granular information from the input stream.

Thus, this project is conducted to study the performance of an animal detection system to help solve and reduce AVCs. This project is driven by the fact that as of now, Malaysia does not have a specific system designed to avoid AVCs. Therefore, hopefully the implementation of an animal detection system can help reduce or probably solve the case of AVCs. In this project, a hardware system comprised of a Raspberry Pi 3, used as a microcontroller, and a webcam is used to implement a system to detect animals. The webcam is used to stream live video footages, where the live video feed will then be filtered through an image processing system to detect the presence of any animal. Any image detected in the camera will then be analyzed through a real time deep learning object detection system. This system will utilize a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network classification system to detect our object of interest. The classification model is pretrained and stored in a dataset which will be used for the detection system.

If we see a single object or hear a particular sound, we are then able to recognize such sample or even different versions of it in other scenarios. As an example, if one sees a iron chair and associates the object to the general concept of âchairsâ, he will be able to detect and recognize also wooden or wicker chairs. Similarly, when we hear the sound of a particular event, such as a scream, we are then able to recognize other kinds of scream that occur in different environments. We continuously learn representations of the real world, which we then use in order to understand new and changing environments.In the field of pattern recognition, traditional methods typically require a careful design of data representations (i.e. features), which involves considerable domain knowledge and effort by experts. Recently, approaches for automated learning of representations from training data were introduced and based on popular deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Representation learning aims at avoiding engineering of hand-crafted features and providing automatically learned features suitable for the recognition tasks. In this work, we proposed novel trainable filters for representation learning in audio and image processing. The structure of these filters is not fixed in the implementation but rather configured directly from single prototype patterns of interest [4].In the context of audio processing, we focused on the problem of audio event detection and classification in noisy environments, also in cases where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is null or negative. We released two data sets, namely the MIVIA audio events and the MIVIA road events data sets, and obtained baseline results (recognition rate of about 85%) with a real-time method for event detection based on the bag of features classification scheme [3, 2].We designed novel trainable feature extractors, which we call COPE (Combination of Peaks of Energy), that are able to detect specific constellations of energy peak points in time-frequency representations of input audio signals [8]. The particular constellation of energy peaks to be detected by a COPE feature extractor is determined in an automatic configuration process performed on a given prototype sound. The design of COPE feature extractors was inspired by some functions of the cochlea membrane and the inner hair cells in the inner auditory system, which convert the sound pressure waves into neural stimuli on the auditory nerve.We proposed a method that uses COPE feature extractors together with a classification system to perform real-time audio event detection and classification, also in cases where sounds have null and negative SNR. The performance results (recognition rate over 90%) that we obtained on several benchmarking data sets for audio events detection in different contexts are higher than state-of-the-art approaches.In the second part of the work, we introduced B-COSFIRE filters for detection of elongated and curvilinear patterns in images and apply them to the delineation of blood vessels in retinal images [1, 6]. The B-COSFIRE filters are trainable, that is their structure is automatically configured from prototype elongated patterns. The design of the B-COSFIRE filters is inspired by the functions of some neurons, called simple cells, in area V1 of the visual system, which fire when presented with line or contour stimuli. A B-COSFIRE filter achieves orientation selectivity by computing the weighted geometric mean of the output of a pool of Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filters, whose supports are aligned in a collinear manner. Rotation invariance is efficiently obtained by appropriate shiftings of the DoG filter responses.After configuring a large bank of B-COSFIRE filters selective for vessels (i.e. lines) and vessel-endings (i.e. line-endings) of various thickness (i.e. scale), we employed different techniques based on information theory and machine learning to select an optimal subset of B-COSFIRE filters for the vessel delineation task [5, 7]. We considered the selected filters as feature extractors to construct a pixel-wise feature vector which we used in combination with a classifier to classify the pixels in the testing image as vessel and non-vessel pixels. We carried out experiments on public benchmarking data sets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE DB1 and HRF data sets) and the results that we achieved are higher than many existing methods.We studied the computational requirements of the proposed algorithms in order to evaluate their applicabilityin real-world applications and the fulfillment of real-time constraints given by the considered problems. The MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithms are publicly released for research purposes.This work contributes to the development of algorithms for representation learning in audio and imageprocessing and promotes their use in higher-level pattern recognition systems",multimedia,926,not included

To do so, we describe the fundamentals of the machine learning approaches when applied to DAS systems, and also do a detailed literature review of the main contributions on this topic. Additionally, this paper addresses the most common issues related to real field deployment and evaluation of DAS+PRS for pipeline threat monitoring, and intends to provide useful insights and recommendations in what respect to the design of such systems. The literature review concludes that a real field deployment of a PRS based on DAS technology is still a challenging area of research, far from being fully solved.Some authors were supported by funding from the European Research Council

Ces simulateurs doivent recrÃ©er des scÃ©narios de vol permettant dâexÃ©cuter des itinÃ©raires rÃ©guliers de vol ou de confronter les pilotes Ã  diffÃ©rentes situations dâurgence qui peuvent subvenir lors dâun vrai vol (p. ex., une tempÃªte violente). Puisque les simulateurs de vol ont un impact direct sur la qualitÃ© de formation des pilotes, une batterie exhaustive de tests sâimpose Ã  chaque fois quâune nouvelle version dâun simulateur doit Ãªtre mise en opÃ©ration. Une bonne partie de ces tests requiÃ¨rent lâintervention dâun pilote qui stimule le systÃ¨me en rÃ©alisant une sÃ©rie dâopÃ©rations de contrÃ´le provenant de scÃ©narios de vol prÃ©parÃ©s par des experts en aÃ©ronautique, ce qui est gourmand en temps, en ressources humaines et en ressources financiÃ¨res. La raison de la nÃ©cessitÃ© de rÃ©aliser tous ces tests est que le logiciel en soit est constituÃ© de plusieurs composants de type boÃ®te noire dont le code source nâest pas disponible, ils sont fournis tels quels par les fournisseurs du composant rÃ©el dâorigine devant Ãªtre simulÃ© (p. ex., un composant hydraulique dâun aÃ©ronef que nous voulons simuler). Puisque nous nâavons pas pas accÃ¨s au code source, il nâest pas possible lors de la mise-Ã -jour de lâun de ces composants de savoir quel sera le changement dans le comportement du simulateur. Dans le meilleur des cas, un dÃ©faut dans un composant aura un impact local et, dans le pire des cas, il peut nuire Ã  tous les autres composants du simulateur. Il est dans ce cas nÃ©cessaire dâutiliser une stratÃ©gie de test dâune large granularitÃ© couvrant Ã  la fois le fonctionnement des composants eux-mÃªmes et lâensemble des fonctionnalitÃ©s de vol du simulateur afin dâen assurer sa qualitÃ©. Dans le cadre de ces tests, afin de rÃ©duire le temps requis pour vÃ©rifier le bon comportement dâune nouvelle version dâun simulateur, nous proposons dans ce mÃ©moire dâautomatiser lâanalyse des rÃ©sultats de test en modÃ©lisant le comportement normal du systÃ¨me logiciel en utilisant de lâapprentissage automatique. Un tel modÃ¨le tente de recrÃ©er le comportement stable du systÃ¨me en bÃ¢tissant des rÃ¨gles reliant ses entrÃ©es Ã  chacune de ses sorties. Les entrÃ©es sont constituÃ©es de mÃ©triques provenant des contrÃ´les qui stimulent le systÃ¨me et les sorties sont constituÃ©es de mÃ©triques que nous pouvons observer. Nous produisons donc un modÃ¨le initial dâune version fiable du simulateur et nous validons par la suite le bon comportement des versions subsÃ©quentes en comparant leur comportement avec celui du modÃ¨le initial. Nous cherchons Ã  voir sâil y a un Ã©cart trop important avec le modÃ¨le initial, ce nous considÃ©rons comme Ã©tant une dÃ©viation. Le but final de notre recherche est de pouvoir appliquer notre mÃ©thodologie dâanalyse des rÃ©sultats de test dans lâindustrie de la simulation. Afin dâavoir plus de flexibilitÃ© dans nos expÃ©rimentations, nous commenÃ§ons dâabord par valider lâapproche avec un simulateur plus simple et ouvert. Nous utilisons donc le simulateur de vol Ã  source libre FlightGear comme cas dâÃ©tude pour Ã©valuer notre approche de test. Ce simulateur utilise lâengin de vol trÃ¨s populaire JSBsim et la librairie SimGear pour modÃ©liser les aÃ©ronefs et simuler leur comportement dynamique dans un environnement de vol. JSBsim est notamment utilisÃ© par la Nasa Ã  des fins de recherche. Nous rÃ©alisons dâabord un vol manuel en utilisant des pÃ©riphÃ©riques de contrÃ´le dâun ordinateur tout en enregistrant les donnÃ©es contenues dans le simulateur. Le vol doit Ãªtre composÃ© de toutes les opÃ©rations rÃ©guliÃ¨res de pilotage afin que le modÃ¨le que lâon en extrait reprÃ©sente fidÃ¨lement le comportement normal du simulateur. Nous rÃ©alisons par la suite plusieurs rÃ©pÃ©titions du mÃªme vol afin dâidentifier des niveaux de seuils robustes pour dÃ©terminer au delÃ  de quels Ã©carts un mÃ©trique dâune nouvelle version doit Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ© comme dÃ©viant par rapport au modÃ¨le. Nous Ã©laborons Ã  cet effet cinq scÃ©narios de mutation du comportement de la version initiale de notre simulateur afin de gÃ©nÃ©rer diffÃ©rentes versions ayant des mÃ©triques qui respectent le comportement normal du systÃ¨me ou prÃ©sentant une dÃ©viation du comportement normal reliÃ©e Ã  un problÃ¨me fonctionnel. En sachant dâavance quelles mutations prÃ©sentent des dÃ©viations et avec lâaide dâexperts identifiant prÃ©cisÃ©ment les mÃ©triques qui dÃ©vient de leur comportement normal, nous pouvons construire un oracle avec lequel nous Ã©valuons la prÃ©cision et le rappel de notre approche de dÃ©tection. En particulier, dans le cadre de notre Ã©tude empirique sur FlightGear, nous modifions une version initiale du simulateur en y injectant cinq diffÃ©rentes mutations qui nâont pas dâimpact grave ou qui engendrent des problÃ¨me fonctionnels avec lesquels nous Ã©valuons notre approche. Les rÃ©sultats montrent quâen choisissant des niveaux de seuil initiaux lors dâune premiÃ¨re calibration, notre approche peut dÃ©tecter les mÃ©triques ayant des dÃ©viations avec un rappel majoritairement de 100% (un seul cas de mutation Ã  50%) et une prÃ©cision dâau moins 40%. En ce qui a trait aux mutations ne changeant pas le comportement normal du simulateur, notre approche a un taux de fausses alarmes de 60%. Nous montrons Ã©galement quâavec une base de donnÃ©es plus large, il est possible de calibrer notre approche afin dâamÃ©liorer sa performance. Avec des niveaux de seuil optimaux qui sont calibrÃ©s pour chacune des mutations, nous obtenons un taux de rappel de 100% pour tous les cas, une prÃ©cision dâau moins 50% pour les versions ayant des problÃ¨mes fonctionnels et un taux de fausses alarmes de 0% pour les versions nâayant pas de problÃ¨mes fonctionnels. Afin dâouvrir la voie pour des amÃ©liorations futures, nous utilisons notre mÃ©thodologie pour faire une petite expÃ©rimentation connexe sur JSBsim afin de dÃ©tecter les dÃ©viations dans les transitions entre les Ã©tats stables de chacun des mÃ©triques. Nous utilisons la mÃªme modÃ©lisation du simulateur. Les rÃ©sultats montrent que nous pouvons battre une classification alÃ©atoire des dÃ©viations. Cette nouvelle approche nâen nâest quâÃ  ces dÃ©buts et nous sommes convaincu que nous pouvons obtenir des rÃ©sultats plus significatifs avec de futurs travaux sur le sujet. Nous proposons Ã©galement dans les amÃ©liorations futures de descendre le niveau de granularitÃ© de notre modÃ©lisation du simulateur au niveau de chacun de ses composants. Cela permettrait dâisoler exactement quâelle composant prÃ©sente une dÃ©viation, et ainsi trouver la source du problÃ¨me.----------ABSTRACT Flight simulators are systems composed of software and mechanical actuators used to train crews for real flights. The software is emulating flight dynamics and control systems using components off-the-shelf developed by third parties. For each new version of these components, we do not know what parts of the system is impacted by the change and hence how the change would impact the behaviour of the entire simulator. Hence, given the safety critical nature of flight simulators, an exhaustive set of manual system tests must be performed by a professional pilot. Test experts then rely on the test pilotâs feedback and on the analysis of output metrics to assess the correctness of a simulatorâs behaviour, which consumes time and money, even more these tests must be repeated each time one of the components is updated by its vendor. To automate the analysis of test results from new simulator versions, we propose a machine learning-based approach that first builds a model that mimics the normal behaviour of a simulator by creating rules between its input and output metrics, where input metrics are control data stimulating the system and output metrics are data used to assess the behaviour of the system. We then build a behavioural model of the last-known correctly behaving version of the simulator, to which we compare data from new versions to detect metric deviations. The goal of our research is to first build a model of the simulator, then detect deviations of new simulator versions using that model, and finally develop an automatic approach to flag deviations when there are functional problems. Our case study uses the open-source flight simulator Flight Gear, based on the well-known JSBsim flight dynamic engine currently used by the Nasa. Applying our approach, we first drive a manual basic flight using computer peripherals while recording metrics in the simulator. We then use the recorded metrics to build a model of this basic execution scenario. After repeating several times our flight we have enough data to identify robust metric deviation thresholds to determine when a metric in a new version is deviating too far from the model. We generate five different versions of FlightGear by injecting harmless and harmful modifications into the the simulator, then perform again our initial flight multiple times for each of those versions while recording input and output metrics. We rely on experts identifying which output metric should be deviating in each scenario to build an oracle. Using an initial threshold, our approach can detect most of the deviations in problematic versions with a near perfect recall (only one case at 50%) and a reasonable precision of at least 40%. For the versions without harmfull deviations we get a false alarm rate of 60%. By optimizing the threshold for each version, we get a perfect recall of 100%, a precision of at least 50%, and a false alarm rate of 0% for the good behaving versions. To open the path for future work, we perform a case study on JSBsim using a variant of our basic deviation detection approach to detect transient deviations using the same model. Our results show that we can beat a random classification for one kind of deviation, however for other deviations our models do not perform as well. This new approach is just a first step towards transient deviation detection, and we are convinced that we can get better results in future work. We also propose to use finer-grained models for each component to be able to isolate the exact component causing a functional problem",multimedia,934,not included

The aforementioned programs and initiatives make use of satellite-based rapid mapping services aimed at delivering reliable and accurate crisis information after natural hazards.

Although these services are increasingly operational, they need to be continuously updated and improved through research and development (R&D) activities. The principal objective of ASAPTERRA (Advancing SAR and Optical Methods for Rapid Mapping), the ESA-funded R&D project being described here, is to improve, automate and, hence, speed-up geo-information extraction procedures in the context of natural hazards response. This is performed through the development, implementation, testing and validation of novel image processing methods using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The methods are mainly developed based on data of the German radar satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, the French satellite missions PlÃ©iades-1A/1B as well as the ESA missions Sentinel-1/2 with the aim to better characterize the potential and limitations of these sensors and their synergy. The resulting algorithms and techniques are evaluated in real case applications during rapid mapping activities. 

The project is focussed on three types of natural hazards: floods, landslides and fires. Within this presentation an overview of the main methodological developments in each topic is given and demonstrated in selected test areas. The following developments are presented in the context of flood mapping: a fully automated Sentinel-1 based processing chain for detecting open flood surfaces, a method for the improved detection of flooded vegetation in Sentinel-1data using Entropy/Alpha decomposition, unsupervised Wishart Classification, and object-based post-classification as well as semi-automatic approaches for extracting inundated areas and flood traces in rural and urban areas from VHR and HR optical imagery using machine learning techniques. Methodological developments related to fires are the implementation of fast and robust methods for mapping burnt scars using change detection procedures using SAR (Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X) and HR optical (e.g. SPOT, Sentinel-2) data as well as the extraction of 3D surface and volume change information from PlÃ©iades stereo-pairs. In the context of landslides, fast and transferable change detection procedures based on SAR (TerraSAR-X) and optical (SPOT) data as well methods for extracting the extent of landslides only based on polarimetric VHR SAR (TerraSAR-X) data are presented",multimedia,935,not included

Au cours des derniÃ¨res annÃ©es, le systÃ¨me scolaire quÃ©bÃ©cois impose une pression croissante sur les 
enseignants. En effet, ceux-ci doivent gÃ©rer des classes de plus en plus nombreuses tout en maintenant un soutien adÃ©quat Ã  lâapprentissage des Ã©lÃ¨ves. Dans ce contexte, lâutilisation de systÃ¨mes tutoriels intelligents qui sont en mesure dâassister lâenseignant dans son travail 
pourrait permettre Ã  ce dernier de consacrer plus de temps aux Ã©lÃ¨ves qui en ont vÃ©ritablement besoin. Malheureusement, dans le domaine de lâenseignement des preuves en gÃ©omÃ©trie, lâoffre de systÃ¨mes tutoriels est limitÃ©e. De plus, ceux actuellement proposÃ©s forcent lâÃ©lÃ¨ve Ã  travailler selon un ordre dÃ©terminÃ© et ils ne fournissent pas de soutien dans le cadre dâune exploration libre du problÃ¨me. Ils lâobligent aussi Ã  rÃ©diger des preuves formelles qui ne sont pas adaptÃ©es aux exigences des enseignants du secondaire.
Partant de ce constat, nous avons Ã©tabli lâobjectif principal de notre projet qui consiste Ã  proposer un systÃ¨me tutoriel intelligent qui assiste lâÃ©lÃ¨ve dans une dÃ©marche dâexploration plutÃ´t que de rÃ©daction dans le cadre de lâÃ©laboration dâune preuve en gÃ©omÃ©trie. Dans le but de lâatteindre, nous proposons le systÃ¨me QED-Tutrix qui a Ã©tÃ© conÃ§u Ã  la suite dâune analyse des 
interventions dâenseignants rÃ©els observÃ©s. Il permet Ã  lâenseignant ou au didacticien de construire un ensemble de preuves acceptables pour un problÃ¨me donnÃ© en fonction de lâobjectif dâapprentissage visÃ©. LâÃ©lÃ¨ve peut ensuite tenter de rÃ©soudre le problÃ¨me choisi par lâenseignant 
en utilisant les diffÃ©rents outils offerts Ã  lâinterface de QED-Tutrix. Celui-ci a accÃ¨s Ã  une figure dynamique afin de dÃ©couvrir des conjectures, Ã  un rÃ©pertoire dâÃ©noncÃ©s pour composer sa preuve et Ã  une dÃ©monstration quâil doit complÃ©ter. Tous les Ã©noncÃ©s proposÃ©s sont analysÃ©s par le 
systÃ¨me qui gÃ©nÃ¨re des rÃ©troactions Ã  lâintÃ©rieur dâune fenÃªtre de clavardage afin de guider lâÃ©lÃ¨ve lors de lâexploration et de la rÃ©solution du problÃ¨me.
LâÃ©laboration de QED-Tutrix a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e par une Ã©quipe multidisciplinaire composÃ©e dâexperts en didactique et en informatique. Le systÃ¨me a Ã©tÃ© construit itÃ©rativement par la mise en oeuvre du paradigme de la conception dans lâusage qui est constituÃ© dâune succession de plusieurs cycles de recherche et de dÃ©veloppement. Chaque cycle se clÃ´ture par une expÃ©- rimentation qui vise Ã  valider 
le travail accompli et Ã  recueillir des informations qui sont rÃ©investies dans le cycle suivant. 
Une premiÃ¨re version du systÃ¨me (GeoGebraTUTOR) a donc Ã©tÃ© crÃ©Ã©e afin dâÃ©tudier notamment les interventions dâenseignants rÃ©els qui ont inspirÃ© lâÃ©laboration de la seconde version (QED-Tutrix), qui est dÃ©crite et analysÃ©e dans cette thÃ¨se.
Nous ne prÃ©tendons pas que la version actuelle du systÃ¨me a un effet mesurable sur les rÃ©sultats scolaires, car nous visons, pour lâinstant, Ã  permettre Ã  un Ã©lÃ¨ve de travailler en conformitÃ© avec des thÃ©ories didactiques reconnues. En effet, la conception de QED-Tutrix sâancre 
principalement dans la thÃ©orie des situations didactiques qui permet de reprÃ©senter une situation didactique par une relation Ã©lÃ¨ve-milieu. Nous utilisons cependant une version Ã©tendue de cette thÃ©orie dans laquelle un agent tutoriel, qui joue le rÃ´le dâun enseignant virtuel, peut agir sur la 
relation Ã©lÃ¨ve-milieu. De plus, nous dÃ©sirons offrir un systÃ¨me tutoriel qui est un vÃ©ritable espace de travail gÃ©omÃ©trique, câest-Ã -dire quâil permet Ã  lâÃ©lÃ¨ve de rÃ©soudre des problÃ¨mes en mettant en oeuvre les trois dÃ©marches dÃ©finies dans cet espace.
Ces thÃ©ories didactiques ainsi que les rÃ©sultats de nos observations ont Ã©tÃ© implantÃ©s dans QED-Tutrix. Il en est rÃ©sultÃ© un systÃ¨me comportant quatre couches logicielles principales. La premiÃ¨re permet de modÃ©liser lâensemble des dÃ©monstrations possibles pour rÃ©soudre un problÃ¨me 
donnÃ©. Pour chaque problÃ¨me, lâenseignant inscrit toutes les infÃ©rences, ou pas de dÃ©monstration, qui sont acceptables pour sa rÃ©solution selon lâobjectif dâapprentissage visÃ©. Chaque infÃ©rence contient une justification qui est utilisÃ©e pour produire un consÃ©quent Ã  partir de lâensemble de ses antÃ©cÃ©dents. Il est possible de les combiner afin dâobtenir un graphe contenant toutes les solutions valides, car les consÃ©quents peuvent Ãªtre recyclÃ©s pour former les antÃ©cÃ©dents dâautres infÃ©rences. Le parcours du graphe contenu dans cette premiÃ¨re couche permet donc dâÃ©numÃ©rer les diffÃ©rentes solutions au problÃ¨me reprÃ©sentÃ©.
Afin de proposer une aide qui respecte lâÃ©tat cognitif de lâÃ©lÃ¨ve lors de lâexploration dâun problÃ¨me, il est essentiel de conserver la chronologie de ses actions. Nous lâavons donc modÃ©lisÃ©e Ã  lâintÃ©rieur de la deuxiÃ¨me couche de notre systÃ¨me. Celle-ci contient des donnÃ©es dynamiques qui sont mises Ã  jour au cours de la rÃ©solution dâun problÃ¨me, Ã  lâopposÃ© du graphe qui est statique, et elle se superpose Ã  ce dernier. En effet, nous indiquons, pour chaque noeud du graphe, le temps dâactivation le plus rÃ©cent qui correspond Ã  lâÃ©criture de lâÃ©noncÃ© qui lui est attachÃ©. Cette approche se dÃ©marque de celle des autres systÃ¨mes, car ces derniers nâutilisent pas la chronologie 
des actions, Ã©tant donnÃ© quâils imposent une sÃ©quence de rÃ©solution.
Pour Ãªtre en mesure de suggÃ©rer diffÃ©rentes pistes de solution Ã  un Ã©lÃ¨ve bloquÃ© dans son processus de rÃ©solution, nous avons choisi de traiter les infÃ©rences selon un ordre de prioritÃ©. Ce classement est rÃ©alisÃ© par la troisiÃ¨me couche de QED-Tutrix, qui utilise les donnÃ©es des deux couches prÃ©cÃ©dentes. Pour lâobtenir, nous recherchons dâabord la solution la plus avancÃ©e Ã  lâaide 
dâune heuristique originale, que nous avons Ã©laborÃ©e et qui permet dâÃ©viter dâÃ©numÃ©rer toutes les solutions. Nous affectons ensuite des prioritÃ©s plus Ã©levÃ©es aux infÃ©rences faisant partie de la solution dÃ©terminÃ©e et qui ont Ã©tÃ© travaillÃ©es rÃ©cemment par lâÃ©lÃ¨ve, afin de respecter son Ã©tat cognitif. La proposition dâautres pistes nous dÃ©marque des systÃ¨mes tutoriels traditionnels qui offrent de lâaide uniquement pour complÃ©ter une solution optimale.
La liste ordonnÃ©e dâinfÃ©rences est utilisÃ©e par la derniÃ¨re couche du systÃ¨me, soit celle qui produit les diffÃ©rentes rÃ©troactions. PremiÃ¨rement, QED-Tutrix offre des rÃ©troactions instantanÃ©es, en rÃ©ponse Ã  lâÃ©criture de chaque Ã©noncÃ©, sous forme dâÃ©moticÃ´nes et de messages courts. Il permet aussi dâencoder des erreurs courantes afin de leur associer des messages prÃ©cis. Il offre 
enfin une aide Ã  la prochaine Ã©tape qui est inspirÃ©e des interventions des enseignants rÃ©els observÃ©s. Cette derniÃ¨re forme dâaide a Ã©tÃ© modÃ©lisÃ©e par une machine Ã  Ã©tats finis qui traite sÃ©quentiellement les infÃ©rences ordonnÃ©es dans la liste et produit une sÃ©rie dâindices permettant de les complÃ©ter. Des messages doivent Ãªtre composÃ©s pour cha- cune des infÃ©rences, mais des 
mÃ©canismes ont Ã©tÃ© implantÃ©s afin de rÃ©duire leur nombre. Les rÃ©troactions offertes sont comparables Ã  celles dâautres systÃ¨mes tutoriels.
Environ 450 infÃ©rences ont Ã©tÃ© produites et prÃ¨s de 900 messages composÃ©s afin dâimplanter les cinq problÃ¨mes actuellement offerts dans notre systÃ¨me. Son fonctionnement a dâabord Ã©tÃ© vÃ©rifiÃ© par un expert indÃ©pendant. Celui-ci a confirmÃ© que les messages produits Ã©taient conformes Ã  la structure dÃ©terminÃ©e, mais que lâÃ©valuation de la solution la plus avancÃ©e Ã©tait parfois problÃ©matique. 
QED-Tutrix a ensuite Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ© par des Ã©lÃ¨ves de 4e secondaire. Ceux-ci ont gÃ©nÃ©ralement trouvÃ© le systÃ¨me utile et ont apprÃ©ciÃ© lâexpÃ©rience. Lâanalyse des enregistrements nous a permis de constater que la structure des messages gÃ©nÃ©rÃ©e permet dâai- der certains Ã©lÃ¨ves. De plus, nous avons observÃ© la mise en oeuvre des diffÃ©rentes dÃ©marches, ce qui confirme le statut dâespace de travail gÃ©omÃ©trique de QED-Tutrix. LâefficacitÃ© de ce dernier est, par contre, limitÃ©e dans le cas dâÃ©lÃ¨ves plus faibles, car la structure des messages est calibrÃ©e afin dâaider des Ã©lÃ¨ves moyens. Le problÃ¨me concernant lâÃ©valuation de la solution la plus avancÃ©e a aussi provoquÃ© la production 
de messages incohÃ©rents avec la stratÃ©gie de lâÃ©lÃ¨ve. Dans le but dâaugmenter lâefficacitÃ© du systÃ¨me, nous envisageons, entre autres, de proposer des profils de tuteurs et dâÃ©lÃ¨ves.
MalgrÃ© les lacunes qui ont Ã©tÃ© dÃ©tectÃ©es, il nâen demeure pas moins que QED-Tutrix est un systÃ¨me tutoriel innovateur. En effet, dans le domaine des preuves en gÃ©omÃ©trie, il est le seul Ã  utiliser des Ã©moticÃ´nes et Ã  proposer diffÃ©rentes pistes de solution. De plus, son Ã©laboration itÃ©rative, par une Ã©quipe multidisciplinaire, permet dâobtenir un systÃ¨me respectueux du travail de lâÃ©lÃ¨ve, ce qui se dÃ©marque de lâapproche traditionnelle qui consiste Ã  tenter de reproduire le raisonnement 
dâun expert. Les Ã©tapes suivantes de conception visent Ã  intÃ©grer des rÃ©troactions sous forme de problÃ¨mes connexes et Ã  proposer une aide Ã  la construction de la figure. Notre systÃ¨me pourrait facilement Ãªtre adaptÃ© au traitement des dÃ©monstrations en logique de premier ordre. Une adaptation pour le traitement du raisonnement sous forme dâargumentation non formelle pourrait aussi Ãªtre envisagÃ©e. Enfin, la suggestion de diverses pistes de solution pourrait Ãªtre implantÃ©e dans dâautres systÃ¨mes tutoriels.----------ABSTRACT
In the past years, Quebecâs school system imposes a growing amount of pressure on its teaching staff. They must juggle classes with more and more students while assuring the quality of their teaching to each of them. In this context, the use of intelligent tutoring systems which can assist 
the teacher in his or her work could allow the teacher to dedicate more energy to each student when itâs needed. However, the offer for tutoring systems for the learning of proof is limited. 
Moreover, the available systems force the student to work according to a determined order and they donât provide help in the context of a free exploration of the problem. They also force the student to write formal proofs when high school teachers rarely demand. With this assessment in mind, we established the principal objective for our project which aims at offering an intelligent tutoring system that assists the student in an exploratory approach when solving geometry proofs instead of a formal proof writing approach. The system we offer is QED-Tutrix which was designed taking into account actual teacher interventions observed in a classroom environment. QED-Tutrix allows the teacher or didactician to construct a number of admissible proofs for a given problem according to the learning goals. The student can then try to solve the problem chosen by the teacher by using the different tools QED-Tutrix puts at his disposal. The student has access to a dynamic geometric figure he can work with in order to make conjectures, as well as to a repertoire of statements to create their proof and an interactive 
written proof they can use to complete their proof. All the statements he provides are analyzed by the system which then generates feedback through a chat window in order to guide the student during the exploration and solving of the problem.
QED-Tutrixâs elaboration was carried out by a multidisciplinary team comprised of experts in didactics of mathematics and in computer science. The system is built in an iterative manner by adopting a design in use approach which consists of a series of many cycles of research and 
development. Each cycle is ended with an experimentation which aims at validating the work accomplished and at collecting information to be reinvested in the following cycle. A first version of the system (GeoGebraTUTOR) was created to study, among other things, real teacher interventions which inspired the implementation of the second version (QED-Tutrix). This last version is 
described and analyzed in the following thesis.
We do not claim that the present QED-Tutrix version has measurable effects on academic results, since our aim at the moment is to make sure it allows the student to work in a fashion put forward by known didactic principles. Indeed, QED-Tutrixâs conception is rooted mainly in the didactical situationâs theory which represents a didactical context by a student-milieu interaction. However, we use an extended version of this theory in which a tutorial system playing 
a virtual teaching role may influence this student-milieu interaction. Moreover, we aim at offering a tutoring system that is a true geometrical workspace, meaning that it allows the student to solve problems by engaging in three mathematical processes described in the geometrical workspace model.
The didactic theories and conclusions drawn from our observations were implemented in QED-Tutrix. This resulted in a system made of four main software layers. The first of these layers is for the organization of the different proof solutions for a given problem. For each solution, the teacher or didactician registers all the inferences or proof steps which are admissible according to a specific learning context. Each inference includes a justification that is used to produce a result stemming from a group of premises. It is possible to combine the different inferences in order to generate a graph of all the different admissible solutions, since the results of one inference can be recycled as a premise for another. The different pathways of this graph which is the output of 
the first software layer allow for the account of the different solutions to each implemented problem.
In order to offer help that takes into account the cognitive state of the student exploring the problem, it is essential to keep track of the chronology of his or her actions. This memory was implemented in the second layer of the system. It contains information that is dynamic and evolves as problem solving occurs. It also overlays the solution graph which is static. Therefore, we indicate for each of the graphs nodes, the most recent activation time associated with the writing of the statement attached to it. This approach stands out from the way other systems operate and in which chronology is usually not taken into account since a solving sequence is imposed.
In order to be able to suggest alternative paths to a student who is stuck in his or her solving process, we chose to treat inferences according to an order of priority. This ranking is carried out by QED-Tutrixâs third layer which uses the data from the first two layers. In order to achieve this ordering, we look for the most advanced solution with the help of an original heuristic, 
elaborated for this project, which spares the system from running through all the admissible solutions. We then assign the highest priorities to the inferences which are part of the identified solution and that has been worked on recently by the student keeping his or her cognitive state in mind. The ability to suggest other solution option distances us from traditional tutorial systems which offer help only to complete an optimal solution.
This list of ranked inferences is used by the fourth and last layer of the system, meaning the layer which generates various feedback. Firstly, QED-Tutrix replies to the writing of each statement with instant feedback in the shape of emojis or short messages. It also allows the 
programming of particular messages associated with known common mistakes. Lastly, this layer of the system offers help with the next step which is inspired by actual teacher interventions. This last form of help was modelled by a finite state machine that sequentially treats the ranked inferences from the list and produces a series of hints to help the student complete them. Messages must be 
created for each of the inferences, but mechanisms are implemented in order to reuse messages according to the inferences content, limiting the number of entries. The feedback offered by these messages is similar in form to the feedback offered by other tutorial systems.
Approximately 450 inferences were produced and close to 900 messages were created in order to implement the five problems currently available in QED-Tutrix. Itâs operating has been verified by an independent expert, which confirmed that the output of messages is true to the identified 
structure, but the evaluation of the most advanced solution is sometimes problematic. QED-Tutrix was then put through a second trial in a class of 4th year of high school. The students generally found the system to be useful and appreciated the experience. The analysis of the session 
recordings revealed that the generated messages help some students. Also, we observed different mathematical processes which confirmed QED- Tutrixâs geometrical workspace status. However, the efficiency of QED-Tutrix is limited when helping students with less mathematical abilities since the message structure is built with the average student as a reference. Problems with the 
identification of the most advanced solution also lead to incoherence between messages and student strategies. In order to enhance the systemâs efficiency in helping the student solve problems, we contemplate, among other things, to differentiate tutorial profiles according to students solving profiles.
In spite of witnessing shortcomings, QED-Tutrix is an innovative tutorial system. Indeed, in the field of geometry proofs, it is the only automated tutoring system to use emojis and to suggest alternative solution paths. Moreover, the iterative and multidisciplinary approach adopted for its design and development stands out from a traditional approach which aims at reproducing expert 
reasoning. The next design steps aims at including feedback in the form of related problems and to provide help with building the geometrical figure. Our system could easily be adapted to handle first order logical proofs. An adjustment to process non- formal argumentation could also be 
considered. Finally, the suggestion of alternative solution
paths could be implemented in other tutorial systems",multimedia,938,not included

La questione Ã¨, in realtÃ , molto concreta. In una fase, come quella che molte imprese stanno vivendo, di ripensamento dei modelli organizzativi e di business, rispondere Ã¨ dâimportanza cruciale per il management. Le imprese, in generale, hanno investito molto per rendere efficaci i controlli interni: piÃ¹ addetti, nuovi sistemi informativi, maggiore lavoro per tutta lâorganizzazione. Lâinvestimento Ã¨ stato spesso dettato da recenti obblighi normativi e dalle sollecitazioni di regolatori e autoritÃ  di vigilanza. Altre volte si Ã¨ trattato di una scelta determinata dallâoperare in contesti di mercato impegnativi, per esempio quelli internazionali, che implicano lâadozione di standard adeguati. La voce controlli ha, in ogni caso, acquisito un peso crescente nel conto economico diventando, inevitabilmente, un possibile target quando, pressate dalla bassa congiuntura, molte imprese si sono trovate a dover stringere la cinghia. E allora anche per gli Internal Auditor Ã¨ diventato importante dare una misura del proprio contributo al risultato.
Ã in questâottica che lâInternal Audit costituisce un supporto per la corporate governance, offrendo un prezioso contributo alla valutazione del sistema di governo strategico e operativo dellâimpresa e assumendo un atteggiamento proattivo per il suo miglioramento continuo. Tutto ciÃ² determina lo sviluppo di una cultura del controllo interno, inteso non come un mero proliferare di controllori rispetto agli esecutori, ma come un sistema integrato dâazienda ove le attivitÃ  di controllo si coniugano con quelle di gestione del business.
La professione dellâInternal Auditor Ã¨ stata caratterizzata, nel corso degli anni, da unâimportante evoluzione storica, che ha determinato lo spostamento del suo raggio dâazione da verifiche limitate principalmente ad aspetti di conformitÃ  normativa e procedurale ad attivitÃ  di maggiore ampiezza nellâambito del controllo sistemico, della consulenza organizzativa e della governance aziendale. Questo processo evolutivo ha richiesto un incremento degli skill per lo svolgimento della professione e ha determinato una maggiore visibilitÃ  e credibilitÃ  della stessa Funzione aziendale.
A tal fine lâAssociazione Italiana Internal Auditor ha fornito un notevole contributo poichÃ©, oltre a promuovere lo sviluppo delle tematiche di controllo interno e di gestione dei rischi verso tutti gli stakeholder interessati alla corporate governance, garantisce la diffusione degli Standard Internazionali per la Pratica Professionale dellâinternal auditing (IPPF), sostiene la formazione continua per la professione e il conseguimento di certificazioni specifiche riconosciute a livello internazionale e contribuisce alla realizzazione di programmi di quality assurance.
Le organizzazioni hanno la necessitÃ  di considerare nuovi approcci alternativi alle tradizionali attivitÃ  di Internal Audit, spinti da business in continua trasformazione e dallâevoluzione del panorama normativo e regolatorio che esercitano pressioni sui costi, sulle persone e sui processi. Il Continuous Auditing e il Continuous Monitoring, che si configurano quali nuove opportunitÃ  da affiancare allâattivitÃ  di Internal Audit, utilizzati in modo adeguato, possono aiutare le organizzazioni a gestire in modo efficace le esposizioni ai principali rischi, in quanto consentono di rilevare, monitorare e prevenire anomalie in modo piÃ¹ facile, completo e tempestivo rispetto agli approcci tradizionali.
Il processo di Continuous Auditing contribuisce a garantire la conformitÃ  alle politiche e procedure aziendali. In molti casi, questo sistema puÃ² operare come strumento di Â«allarmeÂ» per individuare preventivamente aspetti critici del Sistema di Controllo Interno.
Significa quindi, eseguire verifiche ad elevata frequenza (fino, addirittura, nel continuo) su base dati integrali (senza dover campionare) e in automatico (utilizzando i CAAT).
Lâuso implicito di strumenti automatizzati permette anche lâapplicazione di nuove tecniche di analisi euristica in grado di evidenziare lâesistenza di problemi nascosti o non anticipati. Il processo di Continuous Monitoring permette, invece, di avere una visibilitÃ  realtime del corretto funzionamento e dei problemi dei processi operativi o di business dal punto di vista del manager. Il collegamento e lâosmosi di approcci tra i due processi arriva in profonditÃ , a tal punto che in determinati casi gli strumenti automatizzati possono essere i medesimi, impiegati con ottiche e scopi diversi, ma sempre con lâobiettivo di minimizzare i tempi di intervento e le conseguenze di errori, di non conformitÃ  e di potenziali frodi.
Appare evidente il vantaggio che le organizzazioni possono trarre dallâintroduzione di approcci di questo tipo, in termini di risparmi diretti e di minori problemi dei sistemi operativi e di quelli di controllo. Non si tratta di abbandonare gli audit tradizionali, si tratta di introdurre nuove tecniche che consentano di aumentare la copertura della funzione e di focalizzare meglio la pianificazione degli audit tradizionali che per loro natura sono molto affidabili ma anche particolarmente dispendiosi in termini di tempo e costi.
In questâottica, lâottimizzazione della qualitÃ  dei controlli si lega alla capacitÃ  di prevedere i comportamenti a maggior rischio nei vari cicli aziendali che possono impattare sul business e quindi sul conto economico. La capacitÃ  di identificare ex ante un insieme di comportamenti anomali (dallâinosservanza delle procedure interne fino alla frode), costituisce la nuova sfida cui sono chiamate a rispondere le funzioni di controllo, congiuntamente alle funzioni di business. Lâintroduzione di strumenti di Continuous Monitoring o Continuous Auditing nelle organizzazioni consente la realizzazione di questi obiettivi.
In una survey pubblicata cinque anni fa si prevedeva che â nei prossimi cinque anni gli internal auditor si focalizzeranno sempre piÃ¹ sui temi del continuous auditing and assessment, nel tentativo di ottimizzare e migliorare i processi di audit. Gli audit diventeranno piÃ¹ dinamici e saranno effettuati secondo necessitÃ  dettate piÃ¹ dai cambiamenti dei profili di rischio di volta identificati che da calendari di audit prestabiliti secondo le logiche tradizionali. In questa ricerca di maggiore efficacia ed efficienza gli auditor faranno leva sulla tecnologia combinata con la loro innata capacitÃ  analitica di identificare key risk indicators che possono monitorare al meglio le condizioni di rischioâ. Quella che cinque anni fa sembrava solo una possibile evoluzione, ottimisticamente azzardata, delle funzioni di controllo, in questi ultimi anni Ã¨ diventata realtÃ : in tutto il mondo le organizzazioni piÃ¹ avanzate hanno compiuto questo fondamentale passo avanti nel percorso evolutivo della funzione di Internal Audit, e sono sempre piÃ¹ aziende che stanno seguendo lâesempio dei leader, affacciandosi con interesse a questa soluzione. La maturitÃ  raggiunta dalle funzioni di controllo e dai suoi protagonisti, unita a una tecnologia finalmente in grado di analizzare e rendere disponibili i risultati in real time, ci consente di vedere con chiarezza le future evoluzioni.
Ecco che le imprese sono sempre piÃ¹ alla ricerca di tecnologie specifiche che garantiscano gli imprescindibili requisiti di trasparenza, sicurezza e disponibilitÃ  dei dati, nonchÃ© lâintegritÃ  di ogni singola transazione.
Il software di data mining maggiormente adottato in relazione al rispettivo fabbisogno, Ã¨ Audit Command Language (ACL), con la finalitÃ  di rielaborare le informazioni secondo alcuni algoritmi associati agli indicatori di rischio, i quali a loro volta hanno il compito di attivare dei segnali di âalertâ in caso di superamento dei livelli di soglia predeterminati.
Specificamente concepite per le attivitÃ  di controllo e gestione dei rischi, le soluzioni ACL di Audit Management si rivelano essere le migliori attualmente sul mercato e sono riconosciute come leader nel campo della Data Analysis. Per questo oltre 14.500 aziende in tutto il mondo, di cui piÃ¹ di 100 tra le maggiori imprese italiane di tutti i settori, hanno giÃ  adottato ACL",multimedia,939,not included

In questo nuovo scenario di rete, la caratterizzazione e il monitoraggio del traffico nonchÃ¨ la configurazione e l'affidibilitÃ  degli apparati di rete, sono di importanza fondamentale al fine di prevenire possibili insidie durante la distribuzione di nuovi servizi e garantire la migliore esperienza utente possibile.
Sulla base di queste osservazioni, questa tesi di dottorato offre un percorso completo di studio che va da un'analisi sperimentale ad un'ottimizzazione operativa.
Il punto di partenza del nostro lavoro Ã¨ stato il monitoraggio del traffico di un eNodeB di campo con tre celle, operativo nella banda 1800 MHz. Tramite campagne di misura successive, Ã¨ stato possibile seguire l'evoluzione della rete 4G dagli albori del suo dispiegamento nel 2012, fino alla sua completa maturazione nel 2015. I dati raccolti durante il primo anno, evidenziavano uno scarso utilizzo della rete LTE, dovuto essenzialmente alla limitata penetrazione dei nuovi smartphone 4G. Nel 2015, invece, abbiamo assistito ad un aumento netto e decisivo del numero di utenti che utilizzano la tecnolgia LTE, con statistiche aggregate (come gli indici di marketshare per i sistemi operativi degli smartphones, o la percentuale di traffico video) che rispecchiano i trend nazionali e internazionali. Questo importante risultato testimonia la maturitÃ  della tecnologia LTE, e ci permette di considerare il nostro eNodeB un punto di osservazione prezioso per l'analisi del traffico.
Di pari passo con l'evoluzione dell'infrastruttura, anche i telefoni cellulari hanno avuto una sorprendente evoluzione nel corso degli ultimi due decenni, a partire da dispositivi semplici con servizi di sola voce, fino agli smartphone di ultima generazione che offrono servizi innovativi, come Internet mobile, geolocalizzazione e mappe, servizi multimediali, e molti altri.
Monitorare il traffico reale ci ha quindi permesso di studiare il comportamento degli utenti e individuare i servizi maggiormente utilizzati. Per questo, sono state sviluppate diverse librerie software per l'analisi del traffico. In particolare, Ã¨ stato sviluppato in C++14 un framework/tool per la classificazione del traffico. Il progetto, disponibile su github, si chiama MOSEC, un acronimo per MOdular SErvice Classifier. MOSEC consente di definire e utilizzare un numero arbitrario di plug-in, che processano il pacchetto secondo le loro logiche e possono o no ritornare un valore di classificazione. Una strategia di decisione finale consente di classificare i vari flussi, basandosi sulle classificazioni di ciascun plug-in. Abbiamo quindi validato la bontÃ  del processi di classificazione di MOSEC utilizzando una traccia labellata come ground-truth di classificazione.
I risultati mostrano una eccellente capacitÃ  di classificazione di traffico TCP-HTTP/HTTPS, mediamente superiore a quella di altri tool di classificazione (nDPI, PACE, Layer-7), ed evidenzia alcune lacune per quanto riguarda la classificazione di traffico UDP.
Le carattistiche dei flussi di traffico utente (User Plane) hanno un impatto diretto sul consumo energetico dei terminali e indiretto sul traffico di controllo (Control Plane) che viene generato. Pertanto, la conoscenza delle proprietÃ  statistiche dei vari flussi consente di affrontare un problema del cross-layer optimization, per ridurre il consumo energetico dei terminali variando dei parametri configurabili sugli eNodeB.
E' noto che la durata della batteria dei nuovi smartphone, rappresenta uno dei maggiori limiti nell'utilizzo degli stessi. In particolare, lo sviluppo di nuovi servizi e applicazioni capaci di lavorare in background, senza la diretta interazione dellâutente, ha introdotto nuovi problemi riguardanti la durata delle batterie degli smartphone e il traffico di segnalazione necessario ad acquisire/rilasciare le risorse radio.
In conformitÃ  a queste osservazioni, Ã¨ stato condotto uno studio approfondito sul meccanismo DRX (Discontinuous Reception), usato in LTE per consentire allâutente di risparmiare energia quando nessun pacchetto Ã¨ inviato o ricevuto. I parametri DRX e RRC Inactivity Timer influenzano notevolmente lâenergia consumata dai vari device. A seconda che le risorse radio siano assegnate o meno, lâUE si trova rispettivamente negli stati di RRC Connected e RRC Idle.
Per valutare il consumo energetico degli smartphone, Ã¨ stato sviluppato un algoritmo che associa un valore di potenza a ciascuno degli stati in cui lâUE puÃ² trovarsi. La transizione da uno stato allâaltro Ã¨ regolata da diversi timeout che sono resettati ogni volta che un pacchetto Ã¨ inviato o ricevuto. Utilizzando le tracce di traffico reale, Ã¨ stata associata una macchina a stati a ogni UE per valutare il consumo energetico sulla base dei pacchetti inviati e ricevuti.
Osservando le caratteristiche statistiche del traffico User Plane Ã¨ stata ripetuta la simulazione utilizzando dei valori dellâInactivity Timer diversi da quello impiegato negli eNodeB di rete reale, alla ricerca di un buon trade-off tra risparmio energetico e aumento del traffico di segnalazione. I risultati hanno permesso di determinare che l'Inactivity Timer, settato originariamente sull'eNodeB era troppo elevato e determinava un consumo energetico eccesivo sui terminali. Diminuendone il valore fino a 10 secondi, si puÃ² ottenere un risparmio energetico fino al 50\% (a secondo del traffico generato) senza aumentare considerevolemente il traffico di controllo.
I risultati dello studio di cui sopra, tuttavia, non tengono in considerazione lo stato di stress cui puÃ² essere sottoposto un eNodeB per effetto dell'aumento del traffico di segnalazione, nÃ¨, tantomeno, dell'aumento della contesa di accesso alla rete durante la procedura di RACH, necessaria per ristabilire il bearer radio (o connessione RRC) tra terminale ed eNodeB.
Valutare le performance di sistemi hardware e software per la rete mobile di quarta generazione, cosi come individuare qualsiasi possibile debolezza allâinterno dellâarchitettura, Ã¨ un lavoro complesso. Un possibile caso di studio, Ã¨ proprio quello di valutare la robustezza delle Base Station quando riceve molte richieste di connessioni RRC, per effetto di una diminuzione dell'Inactivity Timer.
A tal proposito, allâinterno del Testing LAB di Telecom Italia, abbiamo utilizzato IxLoad, un prodotto sviluppato da Ixia, come generatore di carico per testare la robustezza di un eNodeB. I test sono consistiti nel produrre un differente carico di richieste RRC sull'interfaccia radio, similmente a quelle che si avrebbero diminuendo l'Inactivity Timer. Le proprietÃ  statistiche del traffico di controllo sono ricavate a partire dall'analisi dalle tracce di traffico reale. I risultati hanno dimostrato che, anche a fronte di un carico sostenuto di richieste RRC solo una minima parte (percentuale inferiore all'1\% nel caso piÃ¹ sfavorevole) di procedure fallisce. Abbassare l'inactivity timer anche a valori inferiori ai 10 secondi non Ã¨ quindi un problema per la Base Station.
Rimane da valutare, infine, cosa succede a seguito dell'aumento delle richieste di accesso al canale RACH, dal punto di vista degli utenti. Quando due o piÃ¹ utenti tentano, simultaneamente, di accedere al canale RACH, utilizzando lo stesso preambolo, lâeNodeB potrebbe non essere in grado di decifrare il preambolo. Se i due segnali interferiscono costruttivamente, entrambi gli utenti riceveranno le stesse risorse per trasmettere il messaggio di RRC Request e, a questo punto, lâeNodeB puÃ² individuare la collisione e non trasmetterÃ  nessun acknowledgement, forzando entrambi gli utenti a ricominciare la procedura dallâinizio. Abbiamo quindi proposto un modello analitico per calcolare la probabilitÃ  di collisione in funzione del numero di utenti e del carico di traffico offerto, quando i tempi dâinterarrivo tra richieste successive Ã© modellata con tempi iper-esponenziali. In piÃ¹, abbiamo investigato le prestazioni di comunicazioni di tipo Machine-to-Machine (M2M) e Human-to-Human (H2H), valutando, al variare del numero di preamboli utilizzati, la probabilitÃ  di collisione su canale RACH, la probabilitÃ  di corretta trasmissione considerando sia il tempo di backoff che il numero massimo di ritrasmissioni consentite, e il tempo medio necessario per stabilire un canale radio con la rete di accesso. I risultati, valutati nel loro insieme, hanno consentito di esprimere delle linee guida per ripartire opportunamente il numero di preamboli tra comunicazioni M2M e H2H.
The advent of LTE and LTE-Advanced, and their integration with existing cellular technologies, GSM and UMTS, has forced the mobile radio network operators to perform meticulous tests and adopt the right know-how to detect potential new issues, before the activation of new services.
In this new network scenario, traffic characterisation and monitoring as well as configuration and on-air reliability of network equipment, is of paramount relevance in order to prevent possible pitfalls during the deployment of new services and ensure the best possible user experience.
Based on this observation, this research project offers a comprehensive study that goes from experimental analysis to operational optimization.
The starting point of our work has been monitoring the traffic of an already deployed eNodeB with three cells, operative in the 1800 MHz band. Through subsequent measurement campaigns, it was possible to follow the evolution of the 4G network by the beginning of its deployment in 2012, until its full maturity in 2015. The data collected during the first year, showed a poor use of the LTE network, mainly due to the limited penetration of new 4G smartphone. In 2015, however, we appreciate a clear and decisive increase in the number of terminals using LTE, with aggregate statistics (e.g. marketshare for smartphone operating systems, or the percentage of video traffic) that reflect the national trend. This important outcome testifies the maturity of LTE technology, and allows us to consider our monitored eNodeB as a valuable vantage point for traffic analysis.
Hand in hand with the evolution of the infrastructure, even mobile phones have had a surprising evolution over the past two decades, from simple devices with only voice services, towards smartphones offering novel services such as mobile Internet, geolocation and maps, multimedia services, and many more.
Monitoring the real traffic has allowed us to study the users behavior and identify the services most used. To this aim, various software libraries for traffic analysis have been developed. In particular, we developed a C/C++ library that analyses Control Plane and User Plane traffic, which provides corse and fined-grained statistics at flow-level.
Another framework/tool has been exclusively dedicated to the topic of traffic classification. Among the plethora of existing tool for traffic classification we provide our own solution, developed from scratch. The project, which is available on github, is named MOSEC, an acronym for Modular SErvice Classifier.
The modularity is given by the possibility to implement multiple plug-ins, each one will process the packet according to its logic, and may or may not return a packet/flow classification. A final decision strategy allows to classify the various streams, based on the classifications of each plug-in.
Despite previous approaches, the ability of keeping together multiple classifiers allows to mitigate the deficiency of each classifiers (e.g. DPI\nomenclature{DPI}{Deep Packet Inspection} does not work when packets are encrypted or DNS\nomenclature{DNS}{Domain Name Server} queries don't have to be sent if name resolution is cached in device memory) and exploit their full-capabilities when it is feasible.
We validated the goodness of MOSEC using a labelled trace synthetically created by colleagues from UPC BarcelonaTech.
The results show excellent TCP-HTTP/HTTPS traffic classification capabilities, higher, on average, than those of other classification tools (NDPI, PACE, Layer-7). On the other hand, there are some shortcomings with regard to the classification of UDP traffic.
The characteristics of User Plane traffic have a direct impact on the energy consumed by the handset devices, and an indirect impact on the Control Plane traffic that is generated. Therefore, the acquaintances of the statistical properties of the various flows, allows us to deal with the problem of cross-layer optimization, that is reducing the power consumption of the terminals by varying some control plane parameters configurable on the eNodeB.
It is well known that the battery life of the new smartphones is one of the major limitations in the use of the same. In particular, the birth of new services and applications capable of working in the background without direct user interaction, introduced new issues related to the battery lifetime and the signaling traffic necessary to acquire/release the radio resources.
Based on these observations, we conducted a thorough study on the DRX mechanism (Discontinuous Reception), exploited by LTE to save smartphones energy when no packet is sent or received. The DRX configuration set and the RRC Inactivity Timer greatly affect the energy consumed by the various devices. Depending on which radio resources are allocated or not, the user equipment is in the states of RRC Connected and Idle, respectively.
To evaluate the energy consumption of smartphones, an algorithm simulates the transition between all the possible states in which an UE can be and maps a power value to each of these states. The transition from one state to another is governed by different timeouts that are reset every time a packet is sent or received. Using the traces of real traffic, we associate a state machine to each for assessing the energy consumption on the basis of the sent and received packets.
We repeated these simulations using different values of the inactivity timer, that appear to be more suitable than the one currently configured on the monitored eNodeB, looking for a good trade-off between energy savings and increased signaling traffic. The results highlighted that the Inactivity Timer set originally sull'eNodeB was too high and determined an excessive energy consumption on the terminals. Reducing the value up to 10 seconds permits to achieve energy savings of up to 50\% (depending on the underling traffic profile) without up considerably the control traffic.
The results of the study mentioned above, however, do not consider neither the stress level which the eNodeB is subject to, given the raise of signaling traffic that could occur, nor the increase of collision probability during the RACH procedure, needed to re-establish the radio bearer (or RRC connection ) between the terminal and eNodeB .
Evaluate the performance of hardware and software systems for the fourth-generation mobile network, as well as identify any possible weakness in the architecture, it is a complex job. A possible case study, is precisely to assess the robustness of the base station when it receives many requests for RRC connections, as effect of a decrease of the inactivity timer.
In this regard, within the Testing LAB of Telecom Italia, we used IxLoad, a product developed by Ixia, as a load generator to test the robustness of one eNodeB. The tests consisted in producing a different load of RRC request on the radio interface, similar to those that would be produced by decreasing the inactivity timer to certain values. The statistical properties for the signalling traffic are derived from the analysis of real traffic traces. The main outcomes have shown that, even in the face of an high load of RRC requests only a small part (less than 1\% in the most unfavorable of the cases) of the procedure fails. Therefore, even lowering the inactivity timer at values lower than 10 seconds is not an issue for the Base Station.
Finally, remains to be evaluated how such surge of RRC request impacts on users performance. If one of the users under coverage in the RRC Idle is paged for an incoming packet or need to send an uplink packet a state transition from RRC Idle to RRC Connected is needed. At this point, the UE initiates the random access procedure by sending the random access channel preamble (RACH Preamble). When two or more users attempt, simultaneously, to access the RACH channel, using the same preamble, the eNodeB may not be able to decipher the preamble. If the two signals interfere constructively, both users receive the same resources for transmitting the RRC Request message and, at this point, the eNodeB can detect the collision and will not send any acknowledgment, forcing both users to restart the procedure from the beginning. We have proposed an analytical model to calculate the probability of a collision based on the number of users and the offered traffic load, when the interarrival time between requests is modeled with hyper-exponential times.
In addition, we investigated some performance for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Human-to-Human (H2H) type communications, including the probability of correct transmission considering either the backoff time either the maximum number of allowed retransmissions, and the average time required to established a radio bearer with the access network.
The results, considered as a whole, have made possible to express the guidelines to properly distribute the number of preambles in H2H and M2M communications",multimedia,940,not included

Les simulateurs de vol sont des systÃ¨mes composÃ©s d'un systÃ¨me logiciel et d'actuateurs mÃ©caniques qui recrÃ©Ã©s la dynamique d'un vrai vol avec un aÃ©ronef et qui sont notamment utilisÃ©s par les compagnies de transport aÃ©rien pour former leurs futurs pilotes. Ces simulateurs doivent recrÃ©er des scÃ©narios de vol permettant d'exÃ©cuter des itinÃ©raires rÃ©guliers de vol ou de confronter les pilotes Ã  diffÃ©rentes situations d'urgence qui peuvent subvenir lors d'un vrai vol (p. ex., une tempÃªte violente). Puisque les simulateurs de vol ont un impact direct sur la qualitÃ© de formation des pilotes, une batterie exhaustive de tests s'impose Ã  chaque fois qu'une nouvelle version d'un simulateur doit Ãªtre mise en opÃ©ration. Une bonne partie de ces tests requiÃ¨rent l'intervention d'un pilote qui stimule le systÃ¨me en rÃ©alisant une sÃ©rie d'opÃ©rations de contrÃ´le provenant de scÃ©narios de vol prÃ©parÃ©s par des experts en aÃ©ronautique, ce qui est gourmand en temps, en ressources humaines et en ressources financiÃ¨res. 
La raison de la nÃ©cessitÃ© de rÃ©aliser tous ces tests est que le logiciel en soit est constituÃ© de plusieurs composants de type boÃ®te noire dont le code source n'est pas disponible, ils sont fournis tels quels par les fournisseurs du composant rÃ©el d'origine devant Ãªtre simulÃ© (p. ex., un composant hydraulique d'un aÃ©ronef que nous voulons simuler). Puisque nous n'avons pas pas accÃ¨s au code source, il n'est pas possible lors de la mise-Ã -jour de l'un de ces composants de savoir quel sera le changement dans le comportement du simulateur. Dans le meilleur des cas, un dÃ©faut dans un composant aura un impact local et, dans le pire des cas, il peut nuire Ã  tous les autres composants du simulateur. Il est dans ce cas nÃ©cessaire d'utiliser une stratÃ©gie de test d'une large granularitÃ© couvrant Ã  la fois le fonctionnement des composants eux-mÃªmes et  l'ensemble des fonctionnalitÃ©s de vol du simulateur afin d'en assurer sa qualitÃ©. 
Dans le cadre de ces tests, afin de rÃ©duire le temps requis pour vÃ©rifier le bon comportement d'une nouvelle version d'un simulateur, nous proposons dans ce mÃ©moire d'automatiser l'analyse des rÃ©sultats de test en modÃ©lisant le comportement normal du systÃ¨me logiciel en utilisant de l'apprentissage automatique. Un tel modÃ¨le tente de recrÃ©er le comportement stable du systÃ¨me en bÃ¢tissant des rÃ¨gles reliant ses entrÃ©es Ã  chacune de ses sorties. Les entrÃ©es sont constituÃ©es de mÃ©triques provenant des contrÃ´les qui stimulent le systÃ¨me et les sorties sont constituÃ©es de mÃ©triques que nous pouvons observer. Nous produisons donc un modÃ¨le initial d'une version fiable du simulateur et nous validons par la suite le bon comportement des versions subsÃ©quentes en comparant leur comportement avec celui du modÃ¨le initial. Nous cherchons Ã  voir s'il y a un Ã©cart trop important avec le modÃ¨le initial, ce nous considÃ©rons comme Ã©tant une dÃ©viation.
Le but final de notre recherche est de pouvoir appliquer notre mÃ©thodologie d'analyse des rÃ©sultats de test dans l'industrie de la simulation. Afin d'avoir plus de flexibilitÃ© dans nos expÃ©rimentations, nous commenÃ§ons d'abord par valider l'approche avec un simulateur plus simple et ouvert. Nous utilisons donc le simulateur de vol Ã  source libre FlightGear comme cas d'Ã©tude pour Ã©valuer notre approche de test. Ce simulateur utilise l'engin de vol trÃ¨s populaire JSBsim et la librairie SimGear pour modÃ©liser les aÃ©ronefs et simuler leur comportement dynamique dans un environnement de vol. JSBsim est notamment utilisÃ© par la Nasa Ã  des fins de recherche. Nous rÃ©alisons d'abord un vol manuel en utilisant des pÃ©riphÃ©riques de contrÃ´le d'un ordinateur tout en enregistrant les donnÃ©es contenues dans le simulateur. Le vol doit Ãªtre composÃ© de toutes les opÃ©rations rÃ©guliÃ¨res de pilotage afin que le modÃ¨le que l'on en extrait reprÃ©sente fidÃ¨lement le comportement normal du simulateur. Nous rÃ©alisons par la suite plusieurs rÃ©pÃ©titions du mÃªme vol afin d'identifier des niveaux de seuils robustes pour dÃ©terminer au delÃ  de quels Ã©carts un mÃ©trique d'une nouvelle version doit Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ© comme dÃ©viant par rapport au modÃ¨le. Nous Ã©laborons Ã  cet effet cinq scÃ©narios de mutation du comportement de la version initiale de notre simulateur afin de gÃ©nÃ©rer diffÃ©rentes versions ayant des mÃ©triques qui respectent le comportement normal du sytÃ¨me ou prÃ©sentant une dÃ©viation du comportement normal reliÃ©e Ã  un problÃ¨me fonctionnel. En sachant d'avance quelles mutations prÃ©sentent des dÃ©viations et avec l'aide d'experts identifiant prÃ©cisÃ©ment les mÃ©triques qui dÃ©vient de leur comportement normal, nous pouvons construire un oracle avec lequel nous Ã©valuons la prÃ©cision et le rappel de notre approche de dÃ©tection.
En particulier, dans le cadre de notre Ã©tude empirique sur FlightGear, nous modifions une version initiale du simulateur en y injectant cinq diffÃ©rentes mutations qui n'ont pas d'impact grave ou qui engendrent des problÃ¨me fonctionnels avec lesquels nous Ã©valuons notre approche. Les rÃ©sultats montrent qu'en choisissant des niveaux de seuil initiaux lors d'une premiÃ¨re calibration, notre approche peut dÃ©tecter les mÃ©triques ayant des dÃ©viations avec un rappel majoritairement de 100% (un seul cas de mutation Ã  50%) et une prÃ©cision d'au moins 40%. En ce qui a trait aux mutations ne changeant pas le comportement normal du simulateur, notre approche a un taux de fausses alarmes de 60%. Nous montrons Ã©galement qu'avec une base de donnÃ©es plus large, il est possible de calibrer notre approche afin d'amÃ©liorer sa performance. Avec des niveaux de seuil optimaux qui sont calibrÃ©s pour chacune des mutations, nous obtenons un taux de rappel de 100% pour tous les cas, une prÃ©cision d'au moins 50% pour les versions ayant des problÃ¨mes fonctionnels et un taux de fausses alarmes de 0% pour les versions n'ayant pas de problÃ¨mes fonctionnels.
Afin d'ouvrir la voie pour des amÃ©liorations futures, nous utilisons notre mÃ©thodologie pour faire une petite expÃ©rimentation connexe sur JSBsim afin de dÃ©tecter les dÃ©viations dans les transitions entre les Ã©tats stables de chacun des mÃ©triques. Nous utilisons la mÃªme modÃ©lisation du simulateur. Les rÃ©sultats montrent que nous pouvons battre une classification alÃ©atoire des dÃ©viations. Cette nouvelle approche n'en n'est qu'Ã  ces dÃ©buts et nous sommes convaincu que nous pouvons obtenir des rÃ©sultats plus significatifs avec de futurs travaux sur le sujet.
Nous proposons Ã©galement dans les amÃ©liorations futures de descendre le niveau de granularitÃ© de notre modÃ©lisation du simulateur au niveau de chacun de ses composants. Cela permettrait d'isoler exactement qu'elle composant prÃ©sente une dÃ©viation, et ainsi trouver la source du problÃ¨me.----------ABSTRACT
Flight simulators are systems composed of software and mechanical actuators used to train crews for real flights. The software is emulating flight dynamics and control systems using components off-the-shelf developed by third parties. For each new version of these components, we do not know what parts of the system is impacted by the change and hence how the change would impact the behaviour of the entire simulator. Hence, given the safety critical nature of flight simulators, an exhaustive set of manual system tests must be performed by a professional pilot. Test experts then rely on the test pilot's feedback and on the analysis of output metrics to assess the correctness of a simulator's behaviour, which consumes time and money, even more these tests must be repeated each time one of the components is updated by its vendor. 
To automate the analysis of test results from new simulator versions, we propose a machine learning-based approach that first builds a model that mimics the normal behaviour of a simulator by creating rules between its input and output metrics, where input metrics are control data stimulating the system and output metrics are data used to assess the behaviour of the system. We then build a behavioural model of the last-known correctly behaving version of the simulator, to which we compare data from new versions to detect metric deviations. The goal of our research is to first build a model of the simulator, then detect deviations of new simulator versions using that model, and finally develop an automatic approach to flag deviations when there are functional problems
Our case study uses the open-source flight simulator Flight Gear, based on the well-known JSBsim flight dynamic engine currently used by the Nasa. Applying our approach, we first drive a manual basic flight using computer peripherals while recording metrics in the simulator. We then use the recorded metrics to build a model of this basic execution scenario. After repeating several times our flight we have enough data to identify robust metric deviation thresholds to determine when a metric in a new version is deviating too far from the model. 
We generate five different versions of FlightGear by injecting harmless and harmful modifications into the the simulator, then perform again our initial flight multiple times for each of those versions while recording input and output metrics. We rely on experts identifying which output metric should be deviating in each scenario to build an oracle. Using an initial threshold, our approach can detect most of the deviations in problematic versions with a near perfect recall (only one case at 50%) and a reasonable precision of at least 40%. For the versions without harmfull deviations we get a false alarm rate of 60%. By optimizing the threshold for each version, we get a perfect recall of 100%, a precision of at least 50%, and a false alarm rate of 0% for the good behaving versions.
To open the path for future work, we perform a case study on JSBsim using a variant of our basic deviation detection approach to detect transient deviations using the same model. Our results show that we can beat a random classification for one kind of deviation, however for other deviations our models do not perform as well. This new approach is just a first step towards transient deviation detection, and we are convinced that we can get better results in future work. We also propose to use finer-grained models for each component to be able to isolate the exact component causing a functional problem",multimedia,941,not included

Within the strongly regulated avionics engineering field, conventional graphical desktop hardware and software API cannot be used because they do not conform to the DO-254 and DO-178B certifications. We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge.  There is also a high potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine at a low cost. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by a predictive software running on desktop. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL SC API. First, we create non-parametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames-per-second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated. To validate our models, we render an industrial scene with characteristics combinations not used during the training phase and we compare the predictions to real values. We find a median prediction error of less than 4 FPS",multimedia,942,not included

Different approaches have been used for the development of plant disease models, with relevant improvements in recent years. 
Empirical models have been elaborated using data collected under variable field conditions since the second half of the last century. The so called 3 10 rules for predicting first seasonal infection of grape downy mildew is a precursor of this empirical approach for understanding relationships between pathogens, plants and the environment. By using this approach, the model is developed by searching mathematical or statistical relationships between field collected data and these relationships do not necessarily have cause-effect meaning. Lack of knowledge, accuracy and, especially, robustness are the main weaknesses of these models, which impose accurate validation and, usually, proper calibration when these models are used in different environments or under changing climate. Recent methods of data analysis, like for instance neural networks, improve the capability of searching the mathematical structure of the model but they do not overcome the above mentioned weaknesses.
Mechanistic models are a new class of models based on knowledge of biological and epidemiological behaviour of the system under study. These models (also referred to as explanatory, theoretical, or fundamental) explain the pathosystem on the basis of what is known about how the system works in relation to the influencing variables. Mechanistic models are dynamic, because they analyse the changes over time of the components of an epidemic due to the external, influencing variables. Dynamic modelling is based on the assumption that the state of the pathosystem in every moment can be quantitatively characterised and that changes in the system can be described by mathematical equations. These models overcome the weakness of the empirical models. Compared to the 3 10 rule, a mechanistic model for grape downy mildew increased the overall accuracy of the predictions from ~60% to ~90%.
Complexity of mechanistic models has been regarded as a problem for the implementation of models in practical disease control, compared to the simplicity of the empirical models. This is a false problem, because confusing complexity of the mathematical framework of the model with complexity of model output is misleading. Indeed, it is possible to use complex models, able to depict the complexity of the biological systems, to produce simply, easy-to-use output for growers. Implementation of the above mentioned mechanistic model for grape downy mildew in a Decision Support System used by viticulturists clearly demonstrates the inconsistency of the \u201ccomplexity paradigm\u201d",multimedia,944,not included

,to_check,core,,2013-01-01 00:00:00,core,absolute quantification of choline-related biomarkers in breast cancer biopsies by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry,,"Abstract. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that choline metabolism is altered in a wide variety of cancers. In breast tumours, the choline metabolite profile is characterized by an elevation of phosphocholine and total choline-compounds. This pattern is increasingly being exploited as biomarker in cancer diagnosis. The majority of in vitro metabolomics studies, for biomarkers quantification in cell cultures or tissues, entail proton NMR spectroscopy. Although many &quot;targeted&quot; approaches have been proposed to quantify metabolites from standard one-dimensional (1D) NMR experiments, the task is often made difficult by the high degree of overlap characterizing 1 H NMR spectra of biological samples. Here we present an optimized protocol for tissue extraction and absolute quantification of choline, phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine by means of liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). The selected chromatographic separation system with a HILIC (hydrophilic interaction chromatography) amide column effectively separates free choline and its phopshorylated derivatives, contrary to failure observed using standard reversed-phase chromatography. The metabolite absolute quantification is based on external calibration with commercial standards, and is validated by a parallel 1D proton NMR analysis. The LC-MS/NMR analysis is applied to three breast carcinoma specimens obtained by surgical excision, each one accompanied by a control tissue sample taken outside the tumor margin. The metabolite concentrations measured are in good agreement with previous results on metabolic profile changes of breast cancer. Each of the three cancerous biopsies, when compared with the control tissue, exhibit a highly increased levels phosphocholine, total choline and phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine ratio. demonstrated by numerous in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies  In synthesis all of the altered metabolites participate in the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the major membrane phospholipid PtdCho, as shown in the schematic diagram  In vivo detection of choline metabolites by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H MRS) has been proven to be useful in the diagnosis of cancer  The present work builds on the established correlation between choline metabolism modification and malignant tumor proliferation and focuses on three cancer indicators, namely tCho and PCho concentrations and PCho/GPCho ratio. A metabonomic study is conducted on three breast carcinoma specimens obtained by surgical excision, each one accompanied by a control tissue sample taken outside the tumor margin. The study entails tissue extraction of metabolites and a parallel analysis conducted by onedimensional (1D) 1 H NMR spectroscopy, taken as standard technique, and an optimized implementation of a LC/ESI-MS method. The key feature of the method, which was already reported in 2011  Scope of the present study is to prove that the assessment of breast cancer markers by LC/ESI-MS is feasible and diagnostically valuable. This technique shows a resolution advantage for assaying choline derivatives, and potentially many other target molecules, compared to NMR, and could complement the latter. After the necessary large scale standardization of protocols, mass spectrometry (MS) could reduce the traumatic impact of current bioptic procedures based on its sensitivity and, eventually, replace the current diagnostic protocols.  M.C. Mimmi et al. / Absolute quantification of choline-related biomarkers 73 Experimental section Reagents Standard compounds were obtained from SigmaAldrich. Choline, phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine were respectively in the form of choline chloride, phosphorylcholine chloride calcium salt tetrahydrate and sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine 1:1 cadmium chloride adduct. All solvents used were of HPLC grade. Instrumentation The LC/MS system consisted of a QqTOF mass spectrometer (Q-STAR by Applied Biosystems-SCIEX) equipped by an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and an Agilent 1100 series micro LC pump. 1 H NMR experiments were acquired on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Tissue extraction Human breast-tissue specimens were obtained from three patients (referred to as patients A, B, C) by surgical excision  Choline compounds were extracted from tissue by a method derived from Bligh and Dyer  1) The frozen powder was suspended in 0.400 ml methanol/chloroform (2:1 v/v) and, after thorough vortexing, left overnight at -20 â¢ C. 2) The sample was then centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant extract was separated and stored at -20 â¢ C. 3) The residue was submitted to re-extraction with 0.250 ml of methanol/chloroform/water (2:1:0.8 by volume) and left at -20 â¢ C for at least four hours. 4) The supernatants from both extractions were combined and, after addition of first 0.100 ml of chloroform and then 0.100 ml of water, the resulting solution was submitted to 5 minutes centrifugation. The procedure separates two phases: an aqueous phase containing methanol at the top and an organic phase at the bottom; in some case denatured proteins was observed in the middle. 5) The aqueous phase (that contains the hydrosoluble choline compounds) was directly lyophylized and then redissolved in 0.020 ml water and 0.800 ml methanol (2.4% H 2 O by volume). The resulting minute amounts of precipitates (proteins) were removed by filtration with 0.2m filters. The filtrated solution was stored at -80 â¢ C until it was used for either LC/ESI-MS or NMR analysis. LC/ESI-MS Analysis The LC-MS method previously reported  Positive ESI parameters for standard MS scan were tuned for best sensitivity under HPLC conditions. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer gas (GS1) and curtain gas (CUR): GS1 and CUR were set respectively at 20.00 and 15.00 psi. The DP (declustering potential), FP (focusing potential) and DP2 (secondary declustering potential) were set respectively at 40, 230 and 15 V. The ion spray voltage (IS) was 5 kV. The positively charged molecular ions of choline compounds were monitored by extracting the ion chromatogram of selected mass ranges including the target molecules mass. Data treatment The analytes peaks were integrated with the software Analyst QS 1.1 (Applied Biosystems-SCIEX) by evaluating the extracted ion content (XIC) counts. The correspondence between measured XIC counts and absolute concentrations was established by calibration curves with standard compounds. Details can be found in the Supplementary Material Section. NMR spectroscopy Analysis An aliquot of each aqueous extract (corresponding to 75 mg of frozen pulverized tissue) was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 0. Monodimensional 1 H spectra were collected using a sweep width of 8 kHz and a time domain of 8 K complex data points, with 64 acquisitions and 8 silent scans. Flip-angle pulses of 30 â¢ were applied with a relaxation delay of 5 s. Presaturation was used for suppression of the HOD signal during the whole initial delay. The adopted pulse sequence includes the Electronic Reference Signal (ERETIC TM ) [2] synthesized by an electronic device, which was used for the determination of absolute concentrations. The reference signal provides a pseudo-FID that has all the characteristics of a real NMR signal, after proper calibration, and whose parameters (frequency, magnitude, phase, T2) are controlled from the spectrometer console. Spectra acquisition and processing were performed with the Bruker software TOPSPIN. Data treatment After FID apodization with a shifted sine square window function (90 â¢ ) all spectra were phased, Fourier-transformed and chemical-shift referenced. The integral value of significant peaks were measured. In some cases Gaussian window multiplication of the FID was necessary to enhance resolution of signals: the deconvolution of the envelopes of interest was performed by fitting a mixed Lorentzian/Gaussian lineshape to the experimental pattern. The peak modeling,  M.C. Mimmi et al. / Absolute quantification of choline-related biomarkers 75 performed with TOPSPIN, was used only for the estimate of the integral fractions to be assigned to the single components of peak envelopes. The absolute quantification of metabolites of interest (namely Cho, PCho, GPCho) was based on N-trimethyl peaks  Results Extraction protocol The very first step of frozen tissue pulverization was modified with respect to our previously reported protocol  LC/ESI-MS The LC/ESI-MS analysis of the bioptic aqueous extracts focused on three significant metabolites for cancer diagnosis: Cho, PCho, and GPCho. The three molecules are hydrosoluble and positively charged, due to the choline moiety, hence all are detected by ESI-MS under positive mode. The protocol for chromatographic separation and mass spectrum acquisition had been already established  The Total Ion Current (TIC) Chromatogram of a standard mixture solution of Cho, PCho, GPCho is shown in  The concentration of free Cho and Cho derivatives obtained by LC/ESI-MS analysis are reported in  NMR Bioptic aqueous extracts, obtained as described in Experimental Section, were analyzed by 1 H 1D NMR without any buffer addition. Examples of full spectra relative to two representative biologic samples are shown in  The Cho compounds estimation resulting by 1D NMR analysis is reported in  Discussion Sample choice The first qualifying point of the present study is the availability of a double specimen for each of the three enrolled patients: the first derived from the proliferating carcinoma and the second from healthy tissue outside the tumor margin. Though in principle every metabonomic study should consider cancer biopsies and healthy tissue controls from the same individuals, i.e. internal controls, to account for the individual metabolome variability, this is not always possible and many theoretical conclusions on metabolic markers are based on the differential absolute concentrations in cancerous and normal tissues, without taking into account the tissue source. In this study, on the contrary, we could exclude that the concentration changes of choline compounds were related to the intrinsic variability among individuals. Methodology: NMR vs LC-MS NMR and Mass Spectrometry (MS) represent the principal approaches in metabolomics/metabonomics studies. In this type of application, NMR has many advantages such as high information content of the resulting spectra, ease of quantification and little need of optimization for the analysis conditions. MS techniques can cover a wide chemical diversity with high sensitivity and resolution, but require a preliminary optimization of the chromatographic separation. The present study highlights the complementarity of the two analytical approaches. We adopted 1D NMR as conventional reference technique to collect a full set of information on the aqueous extract of biopsies. The use of 1D NMR for the analysis of unfractionated tissue extract, with hundreds of overlapping resonances can not afford complete assignment and accurate peak integration. For the quantitative determination of our target biomarkers with well established assignment, however, we could adopt the approach of fitting overlapped 1D spectra with modeled peaks. The modeling Only the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) are shown for Cho (blue traces), PCho (red traces), GPCho (green traces). The Cho and PCho components occurring at the retention time of GPCho (at 15-16 min) are due to in-source fragmentation of the latter metabolite. The splitting of the Cho peak into two peaks is likely to be ascribed to the different possible mechanisms of interactions of the molecule with the HILIC solid phase at the operating conditions. A remarkable difference in the relative intensity of Cho, PCho and GPCho signals is found and is consistent with cancer-related metabolism alteration. approach allowed the concentration estimate of Cho, PCho and GPCho in the whole set of sample, though for 2 out of 6 samples it was not possible to resolve PCho and GPCho, and only the total amount of the two compounds was reported. Differently, the combination of on-line HILIC separation and ESI-MS allowed to resolve the target peaks without the necessity of chemical derivatization. The LC-MS quantification of Cho derivatives in the test samples was obtained by interpolation of the LC-MS response, based on calibration curves obtained under the same experimental conditions. Although LC-MS quantitative assessment is safely carried out based on isotopically labeled internal standards, the response for Cho compounds is reasonably linear over the working range (correlation coefficients between 0.9686 and 0.9892 low R 2 values due to random errors). Some critical aspects of the LC-MS approach, that arise from reproducibility of the measurements, remain inherently unavoidable. Some significant metabolite level differences observed in  78 M.C.

At least for Machine Learning approaches, this task is harder than standard (single label) classification because it is not clear for the learning software whether the presence of a feature (typically a word) is an indication of one class or another (e.g. whether the presence of the word âsaltâ is an indication for the category cooking or for the category Austrian food). Multi-label classification is a real challenge if the number of classes is very high and if the number of training documents per category is unevenly distributed. We are presenting experiments with the JRC EuroVoc Indexer software JEX (Steinberger et al. 2012), which has been trained for all official EU languages on tens of thousands of documents per language to assign the thousands of class labels of the EuroVoc thesaurus . JEX is a multi-label classification system using a bag-of-words document representation. When applying such a tool that uses word forms as classifier features to languages as different as Germanic (e.g. English), Romance (e.g. French), Slavic (e.g. Czech or Polish) and Finno-Ugric languages (e.g. Estonian or Hungarian), the question arises how much the classifier performance differs. It can be expected that the significantly higher ratio of word forms to lemmas in Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages has a negative impact on the classifier performance, or that more training material would be needed for these more highly inflected languages to achieve the same performance. Similarly, one might wonder whether part-of-speech (POS) information is useful. JEX will soon be made available to parliamentary and other users. The experiments described in this chapter thus have a practical relevance as they can give an indication to the users and their technical partners as to whether they should invest in improving the software through linguistic pre-processing.JRC.G.2-Global security and crisis managemen",multimedia,950,not included

RESUME
Le Louvre est le premier musee au monde a posseder un
acceIerateur de particules pour l'etude et l'analyse des oeuvres
d'art et d'archeoLoqi.e. Le Laboratoire de Recherche des Musees de
France s'est donc equipe d'un outil t res puissant qui offrira aux
scientifiques de musee la palette des techniques d'analyse par
faisceaux d'ions acceleres qui comprend PIXE, PIGME, NRA, RBS et plus
tard datation C14.
Le rapport d'avancement consigne les travaux que j'ai accomplis
entre le 15 septembre et le 28 f'evr i.er 1989. Pendant cette peri ode
nous avons commence par monter un systeme PIXE d'analyse des oeuvres
d'art des collections de musee. PIXE est une technique multi-elementai
re, sensible, bon marche, rapide et ce qui est le plus
important dans le cas d'espece non destructive. Nous avons ainsi
obtenu des resultats preliminaires sur des echantillons de verre, des
etaIons qeoLoqi.ques , des pigments de peinture et des objets en or.
D'une certaine mani.ere, ces experiences ont ete plut6t un
apprentissage pour moi et l'equipe AGLAE. Nous nous sommes
familiarises avec l'accelerateur, la chambre d'analyse, le detecteur
de rayons X, l'eIectron.ique d'acquisition. Les premiers resul.t ats
sent; t res encourageants, il reste pourtant beaucoup de travail a
fournir pour que le systeme PIXE d'AGLAE soit operationnel en
routine.
Nous n'avons, de plus, qu'un temps limite de faisceau pour le
PIXE, puisque la priorite est donnee aux tests -verifier que
l'accelerateur est bien conforme aux specifications du constructeur.
L'accelerateur presente quelques problemes avec la source d'ions avec
comme consequence un courant de faisceau Leqeremerrt instable. De
plus, nous avons utilise une chambre provisoire. La nouvelle chambre
definitive a ete construite a Strasbourg et est en cours
d'installation. Il n'y a pas a l'heure actuelle un moyen sur pour
mesurer le courant de particules dans le cas d'echanti Ll.oris epai.s,
c'est pourquoi les resultats presentes ici ne s~nt que relatifs. Un
hacheur de faisceau (un composant pour mesurer le courant en
prelevant peri.odq.uiement; une partie du faisceau) est en cours de
construction a Jussieu-Universite Paris VII et sera monte au Louvre
en avril.
Nous avons porte nos efforts particulierement sur 'quatre
etalons de verre, qui represent erit les d.i f ferent s types de verre
etud.ies par les archeo Loques et les historiens d 'art. Ces etal.ons
sont bien connus et contiennent 27 elements chimiques entre le sodium
et le plomb dans des quarit i.tes variables comprises entre 100ppm et
35%. On a obtenus des resu l.tats avec une erreur relative comprise
entre 10 et 20% ,avec parfois des desaccords d'un facteur trois.
Les premiers echant i l.Lons que nous avons ree.l Lemerit analyses
sont des pigments de pe inture broyes provenant de la boutique ""A la
momie"", une maison de commerce en exercice pendant les 18 et 1gemes
siecles. Nous avons alors prouve que PIXE pouvait etre utilise pour
determiner les elements majeurs, mineurs et traces rent rant dans la
composition de ces pigments. De subtiles differences ont ete decelees
entre des pigments de meme denomination, et au contraire des pigments
avec des noms differents ont la meme composition chimique.
Le systeme de faisceau extrait a ete teste sur plusieurs
objets, y compris sur un tableau-faux primitif italien- , un cadre
dore du 15eme siecle et une petite statue en or antique. Pour
l'analyse de la plupart des objets de musee nous serons amene s a
utiliser ce systeme a l'air. 11 est donc crucial que ce systeme soit
parfaitement regle.
On a egalement commence a etudier l'atmosphere a l'interieur du
Louvre afin de determiner si des poussieres presentes dans les
galeries s~nt nocives pour les oeuvres d'art qui y sont conservees.
L'analyse des filtres aerosols pourra etre effectuee par AGLAE avec
seulement des modifications mineures sur le porte-cible.
Les resultats presentes ici ne s~nt pas entierement
satisfaisants. 11 est tout a fait rassurant que tous les equipements
et composants fonctionnent bien pour acquerir les spectres. Mais je
pense qu'il faut encore reduire les erreurs experimentales en
ameliorant le traitement des spectres(materiel et logiciel) pour que
le Louvre soit dote d'un systeme PIXE sur et precis.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Louvre Museum is the first museum in the world to have its own
particle accelerator for the study and analysis of works of art and
archaeology. The Laboratoire de Recherche des Musees de France has
thus taken a bold leap into the future with AGLAE, a powerful ""high-tech""
approach to the conservation of our cultural heritage.
This accelerator will enable the museum scientists to use a variety
of ion-beam techniques on works of art and archaeology, including
PIXE, PIGE, NRA, RBS and C-14 dating.
o
This progress report describes the work I accomplished between 15
September 1988 and 28 February 1989. During this time we have begun
to set up a PIXE system for the analysis of works of art in the
museum's collection. PIXE is multi-elemental, sensitive, inexpensive,
rapid, and most importantly, non-destructive. We have so far
acquired preliminary data on samples of glass, geological standards,
painting pigments, and gold artifacts. In a sense, these experiments
have been more of a learning experience for me and the AGLAE team. We
are becoming familiar with the accelerator, the target chamber, the
x-ray detector, the fast-pulse electronics, and the x-ray spectrum
reduction code. Although we have made a good start, much work still
needs to be done to make the AGLAE PIXE system ""state-of-the-art"".
We have had limited access to beam time for PIXE. Of course the
highest priority has been to ensure that the accelerator meets the
manufacturers specifications. The accelerator has had problems with
the ion source; as a result the beam current has not been very
stable. The target chamber we are using is a temporary one. A new one
has been built in Strasbourg and will be installed in March. There is
presently no reliable way of measuring the incident beam current for
thick samples, thus all the results presented here are relative. A
beam-chopper (a device for measuring the beam current) is being built
at Jussieu and will brought to the Louvre in April.
We have concentrated our efforts on four glass standards, which were
designed to duplicate the types of glass studied by archaeologists
and historians. These standards are well characterized and contain 27
elements between Na and Pb in quantities from 100 ppm to 35%. We have
been able to obtain results that are generally within 10 - 20% of the
given values, however, some occasionally there is a discrepancy of a
factor of three.
The firt ""real"" samples we have analyzed were pure pigments from the
boutique ""A la Momie"", a house of commerce in Paris during the 18th
and 19th centuries. We have seen how PIXE can be used to
quantitatively determine the major, minor, and trace elemental
composition of these paint pigments. Subtle differences were detected
between similar pigments, and pigments with different labels were
shown to have the same chemical composition.
The beam-in-air system has been tested on several samples, including
a false italian primitive, a gilded frame from the 15th century, and
a small gold statue from antiquity. For the analysis of most museum
objects we will be using this extracted beam system. It is thus vital
that we get it working well.
We are about start running air sampling equipment inside the Louvre
Museum in order to determine if any harmful pollutants are present in
the galleries that hold precious works of art. Analysis of the
aerosol filters can be done at AGLAE with only minor modifications of
the target holder.
I must say that I do not feel very confident about the numbers
presented here. I am glad we have all the equipment working to the
point that we can get results, but I have doubts that all the
hardware and software is working properly. We must now work to find
and reduce the experimental uncertainties, in order for the Louvre to
have a reliable and accurate PIXE system.

I. INTRODUCTION
During the last four years the Louvre Museum has been undergoing
a major renovation. Not only is the main entrance going to be a giant
glass pyramid, but three stories under the pyramid a team of
scientists will be bombarding precious works of art with a particle
accelerator. Analyse au Grand Louvre par Accelerateur Electrostatique
(AGLAE) is a part of the Laboratoire de Recherche des Musees de France
(LRMF), which has been given more space and equipment in a new
underground laboratory. It is only recently that methods of analysis
using high energy ion-beams (protons, alphas, 15N, etc) have been
applied to works of art and archaeology, and usually by physicists
working in nuclear laboratories in their spare time. The Louvre Museum
is thus the first museum to have an accelerator to be used exclusively
for the study and analysis of works of art and archaeology. The LRMF
has taken a bold leap into the future with this powerful ""high-tech""
approach to the conservation of our cultural heritage.
II. PIXE at AGLAE
My expertise is with particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE) and
I have been concerned with developing a PIXE system at AGLAE for the
study and analysis of works of art. We have had several opportunities
to do some PIXE analyses under vacuum, including pigment samples,
glass standards, geological standards, and gold samples. Although the
spectra were acquired under conditions that were not ideal, we were
able to perform tests of the target chamber, x-ray detector and
electronics, and the PIXE spectrum reduction code. All results
presented here are therefore considered preliminary and subject to
change.
a. Accelerator
The accelerator, a 2.0 Mev tandem pelletron, was purchased from
National Electrostatic Corporation in Middleton Wisconsin. It is
capable of accelerating protons from 0.3 to 4.0 Mev, alpha particles
from 0.3 to 6.0 Mev, and 15N ions to 8.0 Mev. In addition it can
accelerate deuterons and 3He ions. Guaranteed beam current for protons
is 5 pa through a 1 mm2 collimator. It was installed in the winter and
spring of 1988, and the first beam was realized in June 1988. Tests
and practice with the machine have been taking place ever since then,
and are expected to continue through the end of March.
B. Target area
The target chamber we are using is a temporary one. The target
ladder can hold up to six samples and is moved manually. The sample
surface is perpendicular to the axis of the incident beam. X-rays are
detected at a backward angle of 135 degrees. The detector is
collimated, and subtends a solid angle of 0.5 sr. A new target chamber
has been fabricated in Strasbourg and will be delivered to the Louvre
on 3 March. This new chamber is very versatile and will be used for
PIXE, PIGE, RBS, and NRA.
A beam-chopper for measuring the incident beam current has been
built at Jussieu. It is presently undergoing tests and will be brought
to the Louvre at the end of March. Presently the beam current is
determined by measuring the charge acquired by the target, target
holder, and target chamber, which are electrically isolated from the
rest of the accelerator. Since this method is not reliable, I have
designed and will be building a device to determine the beam current
by measuring the protons backscattered from a thin mylar foil placed
in front of the target. This thin foil monitoring technique has the
advantages of eliminating charge buildup on insulating samples
analyzed under vacuum, and it can be used to monitor the beam current
when analyzing samples in air with an extracted beam.
C. Electronics
The experimental setup for the x-ray electronics during PIXE
analyse is shown in figure 1. The detector is an EG&G Ortec 7900
2
Si(Li), with 30 mm2 area, 8.0 pm Be window, and a FWHM resolution of
147 ev at 5.895 kev. The high voltage bias is supplied by an Ortec 459
power supply. An Ortec 972 spectroscopy amplifier and an Ortec 444
biased amplifier are used together for pulse-processing and dead-time
corrections. A Seiko EGG 7800 multi-channel analyzer with a Seiko 1820
ADC interface is used to collect the spectra. An Enertec 7143 linear
ratemeter is used to monitor the x-ray count rate. The charge induced
by the beam current is measured by a Brookhaven Instruments
Corporation 1000a current integrator, and stored in an Ortec 996
counter and timer.
In order to obtain a resolution of 147 ev on a real sample it is
necessary to keep the amplifier close to the detector (less than 3 m)
and to acquire the data with the vacuum pumps off. Mechanical
vibration from the pumps adds almost 15 ev to the resolution. (We are
working to better isolate the pumps from the target chamber.)
D. PIXAN reduction code
Since my experience with computers has been with DEC and Apple
computers, I have had to become familiar with SUN (UNIX) and IBM (DOS)
computers. PIXE spectra are analyzed on a SUN MS 3/260 workstation.
The computer program PIXAN is used to reduce an x-ray spectrum
to its elemental composition, and it does this in two parts. The first
part of the program calculates the areas of the characteristic peaks.
The background is subtracted and then the peaks are fitted to a
modified gaussian form. The area of the characteristic peaks are
directly proportional to the number of x-rays coming from the
characteristic elements. The second part determines the theoretical x-ray
yield given the composition of the sample and the energy of the
proton beam. It is then necessary to combine the results of the two
parts to get the elemental composition in parts per million (ppm). The
program is designed to be used for both thin and thick targets.
I have had to spend most of my time geting PIXAN to run
correctly. It is an excellent program, but it evolved over a long
period of time at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Thus it is
3
suited to the types of samples they analyze in Australia and the
experimental conditions in their laboratory. The results are
critically dependent on the x-ray detector parameters (crystal
diameter, sensitive depth, silicon dead-layer, and the gold electrode
layer), any external detector filters, the x-ray electronics, and even
the target composition (which determines the self-absorption/self-enhancement
effects). The most important step, and perhaps the most
difficult one, is a proper subtraction of the background continuum.
With PIXAN the background can be modelled either by a polynomial (up
to 5th order), or by an iterative method that removes the
characteristic peaks and progressively reduces the spectrum to the
background continuum. We have found that small changes in the
parameters used to model the background leads to large changes in the
final results. We have found that the iterative method works better
than the polynomial method for our samples, and have achieved results
on glass standards that are generally within 20% of the given values
for the elements Na to Pb (see section 4).
The exact experimental uncertainties are hard to determine. The
precision when measuring an element well above the limit of detection
and isolated from any interfering peaks is better than 5%. Elements
found near the limit of detection have greater uncertainties. Elements
with low energy x-rays (less than 2 kev) and high energy x-rays
(greater than 30 kev) have larger uncertainties since the detector
efficiency is quite low and poorly known in these regions. The case of
interfering peaks must be considered individually. For example, the
uncertainty in the measurement of sulfur (Ka = 2.307 kev) depends on
the amount of lead (Ma = 2.346 kev) in the sample. The overall
accuracy of a PIXE measurement depends on the uncertainties in the
following factors: the number of x-rays in a characteristic peak; the
number of incident protons; the detector efficiency; and the
absorption/enhancement corrections. In general, uncertainties of
around 10% - 20% can be expected with PIXE.
Most of the results to date have been determined without seeing
graphically the background or least-squares fit to the spectrum, a
most unfortunate circumstance. Thomas Calligaro has recently written a
program that displays the x-ray spectrum, the background, and the fit
4
of the data, an indispensible step in proper spectrum analysis. Good
spectrum analysis, even with the best computer programs, still
requires experience. One must know what to look for in the background
subtraction, the gaussian fit, the calculation of the sum and escape
peaks, the relative peak intensities, the unfolding of overlapping
peaks, and so forth. One must be careful and not simply accept the
results given by the computer program.
The data files included with PIXAN lacked some vital information
to make it work correctly for the samples we have at the Louvre, and
needed to be supplemented. First of all they did not include any M-line
x-ray data, which are necessary for quantitative results on the
elements Na through Cl (1-3 kev). We have therefore added M-line data
for Pb, Hg, Pt, and Au into the PIXAN data files. (The elements whose
M-line data is important for us to know immediately.) Secondly, the
data file of relative peak heights is appropriate only for 2.5 Mev
protons. The relative peak heights are important to know since PIXAN
uses them to untangle the overlap of peaks. Although the Ka/KB ratio
is independent of energy, the LalLi ratio, (where i is anyone of the
many other L-line x-rays), and the Ma/Mi ratios vary unsystematically
as a function of incident proton energy. Therefore it will be
necessary for us to modify the data tables for energies lower and
higher than 2.5 Mev in order to obtain the most accurate results. (We
will use the tabulated theoretical x-ray cross sections of D.D. Cohen
and M. Harrington, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables 33, 1985, 255-
343.) Thirdly, L- and M-shell sum (pile-up) peaks are not included in
the peak search and are therefore not removed from the x-ray spectra.
The justification for not including the L- and M-shell sum peaks was
to make it easier for PIXAN to determine accurate amounts of Ti
(Ka=4.508 kev) and Ba (La=4.467 kev) when both are present in the
sample. However, L- and M-line pileup peaks are a serious problem when
a sample contains major or minor amounts of platinum, gold, mercury,
lead, tin, or barium.
III. RESULTS
We have acquired 52 PIXE spectra to date: 12 on glass standards,
36 on paint pigments, 3 on ceramic standards, and 10 on gold samples.
5
A. Glass
We have concentrated our efforts on four colored glass samples.
These samples have been well characterized, and they contain 27
elements between Na and Pb in quantities of 100 ppm to 35%. The
elements between Na and K (X-rays between 1 and 3 Kev) are difficult
to determine yet important in archaeometric studies of glass,
pigments, ceramics, and geological samples. In addition these glass
samples are ideal PIXE targets, being completely homogeneous, flat,
and small enough to fit into a vacuum chamber. We felt it was
necessary to get good results on these standards before we started
analyzing unknown targets.
The glass samples were prepared in 1964 by R. H. Brill and A. A.
Erickson of the Corning Glass Works in Corning New York. The four
samples were designed to duplicate the types of glass studied by
archaeologists and art historians. Two samples (known as Brill A and
Brill B) are soda-lime-silica glasses, which are similar to ancient
Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Ionan, Byzantine, and Islamic glasses. One
sample (Brill C) is a glass with high-lead and high-barium levels,
which is similar to glasses from Eastern Asia. The fourth sample
(Brill D) is a potash-lime-silica glass which is similar to certain
medieval glasses and some glasses of the 17th to 19th centuries. Minor
and trace elements were also introduced at levels that are comparable
to those actually found in ancient glasses. The method of fabrication
of these samples is given in R. H. Brill, A Chemical-Analytical Round-robin
on Four Synthetic Glasses, Proceedings of the IX International
Congress on Glass, Versailles 27 September, 1971.
The glass samples are several millimeters long and are embedded
in amber. They were analyzed at 1.0 and 2.5 Mev, with the intention of
obtaining the light elements (Na to Cal at 1.0 Mev, when there is no
detector filter, and the heavy elements (K to Pb) at 2.5 Mev, while
using a detector filter which allows the use of higher beam currents
and better (lower) sensitivity. The spectrum for Brill C at 2.5 Mev is
shown in figure 2 and the best results to date for the glass samples
are given in table 1. The element K was chosen to be an ""internal
6
standard"", so all the results are relative and normalized to the K
concentration. A comparison between the experimental resu",multimedia,952,not included

The work of this group has considered the difficulties encountered in using these combustion modes through implementation of advanced control methodologies, novel sensor techniques as well as expanding usage of fuels such as bio-fuels and hydrogen. The methods used to obtain the lower combustion temperatures include lean mixtures and high levels of exhaust gas recirculation. For example, LTC modes such as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Partially Premixed Compression Ignition (PCCI) engines show real gains in reduced engine out emissions with improved efficiency. However, implementation of these advanced combustion modes presents combustion timing and stability issues due to stronger dependence of these advanced combustion modes on the physical and chemical properties of the fuel, inlet temperature, and inlet composition than traditional diffusion burning (âdieselâ type) modes. Progress in these advanced combustion modes requires a âsmartâ engine capable of sensing heat release patterns and adjusting combustion system parameters. Hence collaborative work between several researchers at Missouri S&T are considering the required combustion analysis, nonlinear control, sensor development and fuel property issues surrounding the implementation of several LTC modes. Analysis methods currently considered are based on surface accelerations for use on both conventional and premixed auto-ignited combustion types that can robustly indicate combustion characteristics. Surface mount accelerometers are being used to indicate combustion characteristics needed for closed loop engine control but which have minimal structural influence. Acceleration frequency bands are being identified where the structural characteristics has the most influence (i.e. structure resonant modes), thereby allowing indication of other surface acceleration frequency bands which are minimally affected by the structure and more indicative of the combustion behavior. Active control necessitates an advanced control strategy such as adaptive neural networks which we have shown can function satisfactorily even when the dynamics of the engine combustion process are unknown. A near optimal nonlinear adaptive controller using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), based on a phenomenological LTC engine model is being developed. The conceived controller would reduce cyclic variability in start-of-combustion, limit pressure rise rates and control to maximize efficiency through control of heat release pattern phasing. With advanced control algorithms, low-cost sensor technologies need to be developed before robust control of auto-ignited combustion can be achieved on a production scale. Interferometer based sensors packaged in small fiber optics are being developed for the high temperature and pressure combustion chamber environment with response times on the order of microseconds. Finally, advancing the application of advanced LTC modes to enable the use of bio-fuels or hydrogen has become increasingly important for energy security. Consequently, the distinct characteristics of hydrogen combustion in engines are being investigated using advanced simulation techniques to examine more efficient and cleaner operating strategies (e.g., dual-fuel operation)",multimedia,953,not included

This paper describes a general-purpose implementation of RSW classifiers and discusses the highly practical issue of how to choose the size of the input window and the number of previous predictions to incorporate.

The choice of a certain use has got necessarily socio-economic implications that make it more or less suitable for that site. For this reason it is important to insert socio-economic analysis within the studies on contaminated site remediation and to implement approaches that calibrate extent and modality of the remediation on the basis of potential uses of the site after it. In particular it is important to provide decision-makers with tools that offer them the possibility to consider also this aspect, in order to support their decisions.The specific aim of the socio-economic module is providing the decision makers with a tool that makes possible to compare the different use destinations, outlining possible scenarios linked to alternative uses of the considered site, on the basis of socio-economic considerations (often founded on theories and methods of the spatial analysis) and of local characteristics. Comparing these scenarios it aims to give indications on which use is more suitable and why. The final objective is just to establish which is the \u201cbest\u201d use for that site. The term \u201cbest\u201d indicates that it is possible to rank the whole different use destinations. This is a typical multicriteria decision making problem and there is not a natural order in a multidimensional space, so it is necessary to find a device to do it. A method to rank them is to define a function from the attribute space in the real line and so obtain a total order induced by the real number one. The scientific literature is reach of several ways to approach this problem. Here we propose a method typical of Artificial Intelligence: a Fuzzy Expert Systems (FES). The final product is a software prototype for the remediation of contaminated sites: DESYRE (DEcision Support sYstem for the REqualification of contaminated sites, www.r3environmental.co.uk/dstdemo/), that represents a useful tool for decision-makers. Entering data, relative to the considered site, the software is able to elaborate them to give back one numerical index for each possible use destination (UD). These indexes represent synthetic and comparable expressions of the socio-economic implications deriving from each UD. In this way the decision-makers can compare the opportunities coming from the different uses and have a synthetic indicator, without losing the whole information. The software works in a very transparent way, so that it is possible to highlight which factors determine the high or low index value",multimedia,958,not included

There is a requirement for machine-learning techniques to learn from historical patterns and predict future activities. There is an increased interest in machine-learning techniques that can provide useful and interesting services in the smart home domain. The areas that machine-learning techniques can help advance are varied and ever-evolving. Predicting and classifying the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) of inhabitants in a smart home environment are key modules to automate smart home devices. Some prominent examples include uses for entertainment, elderly care, healthcare, and security. The abilities of the machine-learning technique to find meaningful spatio-temporal relations of high-dimensional data and to learn from streaming datasets are important requirements.



Recently, the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) theory has been presented as a biologically-inspired machine-learning theory that attempts to mimic the neocortex, the front part of the human brain. The main features of the HTM theory include the ability to learn and predict temporal patterns. The HTM theory and its computational implementation, Cortical Learning Algorithms (CLA), present a potential alternative to traditional machine intelligence. This research aims to apply a new biologically inspired machine intelligence technique based on the HTM theory and its CLA implementation to classify ADLs of inhabitants by analysing data captured from different sensors in a smart home scenario.



This research started by reviewing existing research in classification and prediction of ADLs. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and their application in the context of smart homes has been carried out as a primary research. HTM theory and its implementation the CLA have been studied, and experiments were conducted to identify the weaknesses and limitations of applying the HTM theory and the CLA for activity classification in the smart home environment.



To test and evaluate the performance of a proposed machine intelligence technique, there is a need for a dataset that represents the ADLs in a smart home scenario. Due to the excessive cost of building real smart home datasets and the lack of real datasets from smart homes, to tackle this issue, as a secondary contribution to knowledge, this research used OpenSHS (Open Smart Home Simulator), an open-source, cross-platform 3D smart home simulator. In addition, forty-two ADL datasets, Simulated Activities of Daily Living Dataset (SIMADL) were extracted from the OpenSHS tool and made available publicly.



This research proposes multi-region CLA techniques to learn short- and long-term patterns. Two novel multi-region CLA techniques featuring a multiple spatial pooler and temporal memory regions that incorporate a hash encoder and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier were proposed and applied. While, the hash encoder can deal with multi-dimensional datasets, because of the existing encoders of the standard NuPIC encoders are prepared to deal with a single column or a small number of columns and the MLP classifier was used rather than the classifiers used in the current implementation of CLA to produce meaningful predictions. Additionally, the two novel multi-region CLAs, Parallel Spatio-Temporal Memory Stream (CLA2) and Cascaded Temporal Memories Stream (CLA3) were developed to learn short- and long-term patterns from, streaming datasets. To remove the limitation of memory management of the original CLA that contains one spatial pooler and one temporal memory, the original CLA learns using one memory level, such model learns either short-term or long-term patterns, not both of them. A novel CLA2 was proposed and developed, to cope with learning both shortterm and long-term patterns. CLA2 can learn both short-term and long-term patterns in parallel. CLA2 includes two spatial poolers and two temporal memories to simulate short-term and long-term memories. The number of cells per column was decreased in the first region to learn short-term patterns. In the second region, the number of cells per column was increased to learn long-term patterns and the outputs of both regions were concatenated into one vector. The second proposed algorithm (CLA3) has three regions, one spatial pooler, and three cascaded temporal Memories (TM) regions, where the first region learns smaller features, and the second and third regions are more abstract in order to learn and recognise patterns and concatenates the outputs from all three regions into one vector.



An evaluation and comparison of the proposed algorithms against state-of-the-art supervised machine-learning techniques and the standard CLA for classification was conducted using both the simulated smart home SIMADL dataset, generated using the OpenSHS, and the ARAS dataset, that comprises data captured from real-world activities of residents residing in two houses, the obtained results for the real datasets offered less performance than the synthetic datasets. Because the inhabitants are asked to record their activities manually, it was prone to human errors. The real-world dataset ARAS House A is inconsistent because one of the inhabitants left the house for long period of time, which impacts the performance results. The results of the proposed algorithms for the classification of ADLs show that its performance are promising. For the CLA2, the average overall F-measure for all the synthetic datasets, SIMADL and the real-world datasets, ARAS is 84.88%, while the highest F-measure (86.87%) was achieved by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The (CLA2) has achieved an F-measure of 92.63% for House B of the real-world ARAS dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art classification models. For the CLA3, the average overall F-measure for all the synthetic and real datasets is 84.50% . The proposed algorithms improve the best performance of base-line (standard) CLAs by an average F-measure of 51.81% overall",multimedia,959,not included

The development of Web 2.0 has permitted Internet users to post, share and exchange their own self-generated opinions or thoughts on various topics on different websites. A large amount of data containing useful information concerning the consumersâ preferences is generated from a variety of sources such as reviews, posts, microblogs or online digital markets. In the case of Food and Beverage (F&B) sector, more and more review websites are established globally (Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.) and most of them allow users to digitally make their own orders for delivery, or take away goods (just eat, etc.), as well as to digitally evaluate about the products or services that they have consumed. The produced information (evaluations) which is generated rapidly can be large and generally modifies consumersâ behavior. It is also notable that the e-evaluations could be characterized as mixed-documents, because users evaluate different companiesâ functions at the same time. However, in most of the cases, the involved stakeholders (companies or customers) cannot mine and analyze in real time the useful information that is created due to the lack of resources and  humansâ physical or mental restrictions.In bibliography, there are various methodologies to face this problem, with the sentiment analysis being the preferred one. It is presented as the automatic detection of positive or negative expressions in user generated content. Also, in research there are two approaches: the machine learning approach and the semantic orientation approach and three levels of analysis: the document-level, the sentence-level and the aspect-level. A lot of frameworks have already proposed that use machine learning techniques, while the semantic orientation approach has not received the same interest yet. However, some previous researches concluded that the semantic orientation approach may be more efficient when implemented for classifying usersâ opinions and for determining the polarity and the strength of opinions at the same time. Finally, while a lot has been written and researched about sentiment analysis in various domains and languages too, the F&B sector in the Greek language has drawn limited researchersâ attention. This study faces this problem by making a suggestion of a new hybrid framework of sentiment analysis using the semantic orientation approach. A thorough analysis of 91,504 customersâ reviews (9,150 reviews in the training set) collected from an e-ordering platform of some F&B companies distributed in almost all prefectures of Greece is occurred. After, the implementation of some well-known models and metrics in the training set (BOW, tf-idf and POS) resulted in the creation of an opinion dictionary concerning the F&B domain. The dictionary consists of three sub-dictionaries that correspond to three companiesâ functions (quality of food, customer service and image of the company). Further, after the implementation of the PMI metric in the training set, the relationships between the parts of the speech and their positions in mixed customersâ e-valuations are identified and used for constructing the proposed patterns of tags. The patterns of tags are then used for detecting and quantifying the customersâ opinions per function in a review. The main innovation of this framework is based on the form of the analysis, first at sentence and after at aspect-level. Also, a new hybrid technique for constructing opinion dictionaries is proposed, using all the known techniques that are presented in bibliography (manually-technique, corpus-based technique and dictionary-based technique). Finally, since the extraction of useful information from the user generated content must usually be held in real-time in order to facilitate the stakeholders to make smart decisions on-time, a web-based system that able to mine and analyze customersâ evaluations in almost real-time, is introduced. For this, two modules will be designed and implemented. The first is a web scraping module for mining the reviews from all e-ordering platforms and the second is a module for implementing the proposed hybrid framework.Based on the confusion matrix of the designed sets, the well-known performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score were computed. The results showed a remarkable high performance on the sentiment classification and the aspect-level analysis respectively. Specifically, the proposed hybrid framework showed an average accuracy of 98.45% in the training set concerning the sentiment classification. Moreover, it showed an average accuracy of 93.61% in the annotated set concerning the aspect-analysis. Then, for the purposes of assessing the framework in a big set of customersâ reviews, it tested in the data set and it showed an extremely high average accuracy of 90.69%. However, in all designed sets were calculated lower values in negative predictions, mainly due to the identification difficulties of negation and sarcasm, in natural language texts. In more detail, the framework showed an average recall of 85.99% in negative predictions against of 99.43% in positive predictions in the training set, an average recall of 81.49% in negative predictions against of 96.43% in positive predictions in the annotated set and an average recall of 70.81% in negative predictions against of 95.79% in positive predictions in the data set. It is noteworthy that the performance of negative prediction remains at a high level, comparable to other similar researches. The average high values of the metrics lead us to conclude that the vast majority of aspects that described the examined functions in the F&B sector with the semantic orientation terms (adjectives) that con-currently occur, were detected. To conclude, a new technique for managing the instances that cannot be detected and evaluated by the system is proposed.Î¤Î· ÏÎ·Î¼ÎµÏÎ¹Î½Î® ÎµÏÎ¿ÏÎ®, ÏÎ¿Î»Î»Î­Ï ÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÎ®ÏÎµÎ¹Ï ÏÏÎ·ÏÎ¹Î¼Î¿ÏÎ¿Î¹Î¿ÏÎ½ ÏÎ± Î¼Î­ÏÎ± ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½ÏÎ½Î¹ÎºÎ®Ï Î´Î¹ÎºÏÏÏÏÎ·Ï Î¼Îµ ÏÎºÎ¿ÏÏ Î½Î± Î²ÎµÎ»ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ½ ÏÎ·Î½ ÎµÏÏÎ½ÏÎ¼Î¯Î± ÏÎ¿ÏÏ ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î½Î± Î¼ÎµÎ³Î¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Î¹Î®ÏÎ¿ÏÎ½ ÏÎ± ÎºÎ­ÏÎ´Î· ÏÎ¿ÏÏ, Î¼Î­ÏÏ ÏÎ·Ï ÏÏÎ¿Î²Î¿Î»Î®Ï ÏÏÎ½ Î±Î³Î±Î¸ÏÎ½ ÏÎ¿ÏÏ (ÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ½ÏÎ± Î® ÏÏÎ·ÏÎµÏÎ¯ÎµÏ).

,to_check,core,Assessing the relationship between macro-faunal burrowing activity and mudflat geomorphology from UAV-based Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry,2020-05-01 00:00:00,core,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111717,,"International audienceCharacterisation of the ecosystem functioning of mudflats requires insight on the morphology and facies of these coastal features, but also on biological processes that influence mudflat geomorphology, such as crab bioturbation and the formation of benthic biofilms, as well as their heterogeneity at cm or less scales. Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the waterlogged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the timeconsuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect. Manual extraction of image features could be automated in the future through the use of deep-learning algorithms",science,962,not included

One of these challenges is the modelling of the complex interaction that audio and visual stimuli have and how this interaction is interpreted by human users. The No-Reference Audio-Visual Quality Metric Based on a Deep Autoencoder (NAViDAd) deals with this problem from a machine learning perspective. The metric receives two sets of audio and video features descriptors and produces a low-dimensional set of features used to predict the audio-visual quality. A basic implementation of NAViDAd was able to produce accurate predictions tested with a range of different audio-visual databases. The current work performs an ablation study on the base architecture of the metric. Several modules are removed or re-trained using different configurations to have a better understanding of the metric functionality. The results presented in this study provided important feedback that allows us to understand the real capacity of the metric's architecture and eventually develop a much better audio-visual quality metric.Science Foundation IrelandInsight Research CentreConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientfico eTecnol ogico (CNPq)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de NÄ±vel Superior (CAPES)Fundacao de Apoio aPesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)University of BrasÄ±lia (UnB)2020-12-15 JG: external PDF cover page remove",science,963,not included

  Trade-off",2020-04-10 00:00:00,core,10.3390/e22050544,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04948,"When gradient descent (GD) is scaled to many parallel workers for large scale
machine learning problems, its per-iteration computation time is limited by the
straggling workers. Straggling workers can be tolerated by assigning redundant
computations and coding across data and computations, but in most existing
schemes, each non-straggling worker transmits one message per iteration to the
parameter server (PS) after completing all its computations. Imposing such a
limitation results in two main drawbacks; over-computation due to inaccurate
prediction of the straggling behaviour, and under-utilization due to treating
workers as straggler/non-straggler and discarding partial computations carried
out by stragglers. In this paper, to overcome these drawbacks, we consider
multi-message communication (MMC) by allowing multiple computations to be
conveyed from each worker per iteration, and design straggler avoidance
techniques accordingly. Then, we analyze how the proposed designs can be
employed efficiently to seek a balance between the computation and
communication latency to minimize the overall latency. Furthermore, through
extensive simulations, both model-based and real implementation on Amazon EC2
servers, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of these designs in
different settings, and demonstrate that MMC can help improve upon existing
straggler avoidance schemes.Comment: This paper was presented in part at the 2019 IEEE International

A blind quality control (BQC) is intended to appear as a real case to the analyst to remove any intentional or subconscious bias. A BQC program allows a real-time assessment of the laboratoryâs policies and procedures and monitors reliability of casework. In September 2015, the Houston Forensic Science Center (HFSC) began a BQC program in blood alcohol analysis. Between September 2015 and July 2018, HFSC submitted 317 blind cases: 89 negative samples and 228 positive samples at five target concentrations (0.08, 0.15, 0.16, 0.20 and 0.25 g/100 mL; theoretical targets). These blood samples were analyzed by a headspace gas chromatograph interfaced with dual-flame ionization detectors (HS-GC-FID). All negative samples produced `no ethanol detectedâ results. The mean (range) of reported blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) for the aforementioned target concentrations was 0.075 (0.073â0.078), 0.144 (0.140â0.148), 0.157 (0.155â0.160), 0.195 (0.192â0.200) and 0.249 (0.242â0.258) g/100 mL, respectively. The average BAC percent differences from the target for the positive blind cases ranged from â0.4 to â6.3%, within our uncertainty of measurement (8.95â9.18%). The rate of alcohol evaporation/degradation was determined negligible. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to compare the % difference in BAC among five target concentrations, eight analysts, three HS-GC-FID instruments and two pipettes. The variables other than target concentrations showed no significant difference (P \u3eâ0.2). While the 0.08 g/100 mL target showed a significantly larger % difference than higher target concentrations (0.15â0.25 g/100 mL), the % differences among the higher targets were not concentration-dependent. Despite difficulties like gaining buy-in from stakeholders and mimicking evidence samples, the implementation of a BQC program has improved processes, shown methods are reliable and added confidence to staffâs testimony in court",science,966,not included

In the age of new media, increasingly characterized by the spread of fake news (AGCOM 2018), new communication âplacesâ, such as institutional sites, blogs and social media, are becoming real reference points, not only in the collecting and diffusion of technical-scientific information for specialists (Martinelli et al. 2017), but also for those who previously had not come into direct contact with specific topics and are faced now with an excessive volume of data (Pellegrini, Rubin 2017). As a result, in the so-called ""Dr. Google Era"" the issue of public communication of science and health news becomes crucial, especially in a context characterized by a growing attention to the reliability of sources and the truthfulness of information. In this scenario, public authorities, in the broadest sense of the term, are called upon to face one of the most difficult challenges they have had to face so far:Public Engagement with Science and Technology (Greco, Pitrelli 2009; Scamuzzi, De Bortoli 2012). In the academic context, this approach recalls the two ""classic"" missions of the University as a social actor, namely education and research, and more immediately refers to the so-called ""Third Mission"" (ANVUR 2014). It is interesting to pay attention on two fundamental elements: (i) the role played by the medical faculties in these processes, as public bodies responsible for education and research in the field of biomedical studies par excellence; (ii) the implementation practices with which these educational institutions carry out the third mission and, therefore, can find legitimacy and be easily recognized by users. For these reasons, we will first analyse the Public Engagement activities carried out by the Italian medical faculties. Secondly, through a comparative analysis with the best practices, we will proceed to identify the set of specific measures in a perspective of future evaluation of quality and academic research, in order to build a possible model of Public Engagement for the medical faculties.

such problematics specific to both human rights and human rights
education: proliferation, prioritisation and pluralism. These three suggested
problematics present very real issues not simply for the implementation of
rights through human rights education but raise too in the theoretical realm a
wider series of multi-disciplinary problematics relevant to the philosophy of
human rights, law and social policy, politics and governance. These three
problematics are, however, themselves framed by a larger, problematic grand
narrative. This is a coda of existential threat. It is this which draws human
rights and human rights education into the arena of security in relation to the
protection of rights from a diversity of threats. Indeed, the origins and ends of
human rights and human rights education are encircled both in historical

Il campo di intervento Ã¨ quello dell'Edilizia Residenziale Pubblica, dove, nelle recenti costruzioni, in numerosi casi si riscontra, dal punto di vista tecnico, un elevato standard della qualitÃ  abitativa, dal punto di vista sociale, un'interessante varietÃ  di tipologie di nuclei familiari (per consistenza numerica, modalitÃ  aggregativa, appartenenza culturale), entrambe caratteristiche che fanno dell'ERP un luogo stimolante per la ricerca.

Nel settore ERP convergono diversi attori. La ricerca si occupa del processo di conoscenza che coinvolge ognuno di essi (progettisti, tecnici di enti proprietari e di gestione, tecnici delle imprese di costruzione), con particolare attenzione alle persone che abitano negli alloggi. Di fatto, per ottenere risultati efficaci rispetto agli investimenti sostenuti, si presenta la necessitÃ  che gli inquilini assumano comportamenti consapevoli: per questo, la ricerca prospetta l'introduzione di nuovi attori, quali studenti (supportati dai loro insegnanti) che frequentano l'ultimo anno degli Istituti secondari superiori ad indirizzo tecnico, ai quali affidare il ruolo di formatori degli inquilini attraverso momenti di incontro da ripetere nel tempo.

La ricerca prevede l'ideazione dell'Applicazione ASA (Approccio Sostenibile all'Abitare), personalizzata per ogni alloggio ed edificio considerato attraverso il lavoro comune di studenti e inquilini; i dati sono quelli raccolti e trasferiti da un attore all'altro in tappe precedenti della ricerca.

Si descrivono le caratteristiche che la rendono utilizzabile come strumento di conoscenza e gestione per la propria abitazione, per ottenere risparmio nel rispetto delle condizioni di benessere; si illustrano aspetti che consentono di impiegarla per la gestione degli spazi comuni e del verde, per un miglioramento delle relazioni sociali. 

Pensata per essere messa a disposizione su iPad, accessibile a tutti gli inquilini in uno spazio comune dell'edificio dove si svolgono i momenti di formazione, ASA Ã¨ scaricabile su dispositivi personali mobili. 

Tra i risultati della ricerca, si presenta una schematizzazione dei passaggi logici che costituiscono il processo dinamico dell'App. Si delineano i vantaggi economici e sociali per i diversi attori.

In un passaggio successivo, la ricerca passerÃ  alla fase operativa, in cui gli inquilini potranno utilizzare l'App ASA anche per dialogare tra di loro e con i tecnici addetti alla gestione. Ulteriori sviluppi porteranno alla formazione della Community (ASA), che farÃ  dialogare tra di loro tutti gli attori.This research project introduces an innovative tool promoting participatory processes for building sustainability. The action area is the Public Housing system where most recent buildings now show both a high technical standard and a captivating social variety of family households (including number of members, aggregations, cultural identity) â both characteristics making Public Housing an interesting research topic.

Different players are involved in a Public Housing system. This research deals with their specific knowledge process, with special attention paid to tenants. As a matter of fact, to get efficient outcomes against the investments made, tenants are needed to engage in responsible behaviors. This research envisages calling in new players, such as senior students from technical high schools who would be trained by their teachers to achieve a focused technical, psychological and pedagogical expertise. Students would then act as trainers themselves and coach the tenants through meetings scheduled over the time.

An Application called ASA as Sustainable Housing Approach will be designed to include the information provided by the tenants about their family households and housing units during the coaching sessions and collected by the student-coaches.  Data used will be that collected and transferred from a player to another in prior research phases.  The characteristics of the ASA as a knowledge and management tool intended to improve savings and wellbeing are described. The points whereby the ASA can be used for effectively managing common areas and green spaces to ease the social interactions are explained too.

Available on iPad and accessible to all tenants in the training environment, the ASA can be downloaded to mobile devices. 

The logical steps making up the ASAâs dynamic process are outlined and a real data simulation is proposed. The economic and social benefits for the different players are outlined as well.

Thanks to future developments of the ASA, tenants will be able to interact with each other and with the housing management instituteâs experts. Further implementation of this App will lead to the creation of an ASA Community, allowing all players to interact",science,971,not included

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming field with many practical applications and active research topics that deals with both pattern recognition and machine learning. We now use software and applications to automate routine labor, understand speech (using Natural Language Processing) or images (extracting hierarchical features and patterns for object detection and pattern recognition), make diagnoses in medicine, even intricate surgical procedures and support basic scientific research.
This thesis deals with exploring the application of a specific branch of AI, or a specific tool, Deep Learning (DL) to real world engineering problems which otherwise had been difficult to solve using existing methods till date. Here we focus on different Deep Learning based methods to deal with several such problems. We also explore the inner workings of such models through an explanation stage for each of the applied DL based strategies that gives us a sense of how such typical black box models work, or as we call it, an explanation stage for the DL model.
This explanation framework is an important step as previously, Deep Learning based models were thought to be frameworks which produce good results (classification, object detection, object recognition to name a few), but with no explanations or immediately visible causes as to why it achieves the results it does. This made Deep Learning based models hard to trust amongst the scientific community. In this thesis, we aim to achieve just that by deploying such explanation frameworks, which will be discussed later in the subsequent chapters. We use one such explanation framework to develop a surrogate model to predict properties of microstructures as well.
Furthermore, we dig deep into the realm of semi-supervised or weakly supervised learning which utilizes minimal data for its training phase and develop a novel framework capable of accurately predicting yields of crops like sorghum. We utilize this framework to learn from available data in an online fashion, annotate new data, significantly reduce manual annotation time and at the same time predict crop yield, a first of its kind within the target application domain.
We also propose a new generative modeling approach, Surrogate Invariance Network (S-InvNet), that can efficiently model data spaces with known invariances. We devise an adversarial training algorithm to encode such invariances into the data distribution. We validate our framework by reconstructing two-phase microstructures with desired physical properties. The physical properties are governed by a data-driven surrogate model which acts as the invariance for our case. In essence, we fuse a generative and a classification model with the classification model acting as an invariance checker that enforces the property of the target microstructure.
How a Deep Learning model can iteratively solve a non-linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based on a given set of initial conditions and using a Physics-governed loss function (instead of traditional loss functions used to optimize Deep Learning models) is presently an area of great research interest. We explore this as well. Previous literature deal with utilizing a single loss function to solve such examples of PDE-governed systems. Moreover, the most recent work proposes to solve only a simple spatially varying PDE (Darcy Flow). We extend the framework to deal with both spatial and time-varying PDEs (Burgers\u27 Equation). Furthermore, we also propose an alternating minimization process for optimizing neural networks as PDE-solvers. This alternatively minimizes two separate loss functions. We note that this process works just as well as the single loss minimization and in certain cases, performs even better. From a neural network standpoint, we use a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder framework as our PDE-surrogate",science,972,not included

In order to fulfil this objective, methodologies developed or improved in WP3 were applied in the JRAPs;the provision of data assembled and distributed was undertaken according to the WP5 recommendations; dedicated topical approaches of the scientific strategy matured jointly with WP1&4 (Deliverable D4.1) were applied within the JRAPs, providing then in return essential input to the future road map of the research infrastructures. Indeed, six JRAPs were implemented to address different key environmental issues and/or policy needs such as those considered by the MSFD, and according to the 6 JERICO-NEXT scientific areas:
1- JRAP#1 on pelagic biodiversity
2- JRAP#2 on benthic biodiversity
3- JRAP#3 on chemical contaminant occurrence and related biological responses
4- JRAP#4 on hydrography and transport
5- JRAP#5 on carbon fluxes and carbonate system
6- JRAP#6 on operational oceanography and forecasting.
These JRAPs were not intending to implement similar actions at each JERICO-RI site but only to a selection of sites/regions according to the consortium interests and requirements from local to regional scales. Consequently, it is paramount to regionally synthesize the preliminary results after deployments in JRAPs, which is the purpose of this document.
The main document is organised according to the following regions and sites:
	- Bay of Biscay (South East Bay of Biscay, Portuguese Margin and NazarÃ© Canyon,Â  Girond Mud patch and Bay of Brest)
	- Channel and North Sea
	- Kattegat and Skagerrak Sea
	- Baltic Sea
	- Norwegian Sea
	- Med. Sea: From Liguria to the Ibiza Channel
	- Med. Sea: Northern Adriatic Sea
	- Med. Sea: Cretan Sea.
Results for those regions are presented in chapter 3 after consideration of the regional or site specificities related to the most relevant scientific issues of the area and the most relevant societal and policy needs, respectively. As the project and the JRAPs were not a priori organised to fit with regional to local needs, the reader may identify a weak point in the way JERICO-NEXT is addressing scientific syntheses per region. Nevertheless, it is a preliminary work towards the regional structuration of the RI, as expected, and a significant effort was put forth to identify discrepancies in the level of regional integration, and the recommended way to progress on this issue is presented in Chapter 4.

	- Success in the implementation of a high-resolution model with data assimilation able to describe the energetic dynamics and coastal ocean impacts of this long submarine canyon.
	- Progress in understanding the crucial importance of real-time monitoring infrastructures (fixed platforms, HF radars) to the characterization and operational forecasting of coastal ocean areas marked by the presence of submarine canyons, view the energetic and short spatial scale processes that are associated with these topographic features and the impacts canyons promote on larger domains of the coastal ocean.Â 
	- Progress in understanding the dominant processes of subinertial dynamics in the Nazare Canyon area of influence, contributing to define the main components of a real-time monitoring system for this area.
Â 
Channel and North Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 4, 5
	- Successful implementation of innovative (semi-)automated techniques for the monitoring of phytoplankton dynamics and C cycle in the English Channel and the North SeaÂ  - an extended shelf system influenced by multiple sources of human pressure and contrasting hydrodynamical conditions
	- Some of these methods were compared with traditional laboratory analysis which helped to better address the added value of innovative techniques in terms of improving the spatial and temporal resolution (both in surface and in the water column), making it possible to consider functional and, sometimes, even taxonomical characterization of phytoplankton communities composition as well as photo-physiology, at high Â resolution, in almost real-time.
	- New insights into the seasonality of the spatial distribution of delta partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) measured continuously on ships of opportunity at a regional scale in the North Sea, and the relation between marine sinks of CO2 with high total chlorophyll a fluorescence.
	- Automated techniques made it possible to characterize the size and functional composition of phytoplankton communities (from pico- to microphytoplankton) through the main bloom episodes including outburst of potential HABs as Pseudo-nitszchia spp. and Phaeocystis globosa (characterized as high or low red fluorescence nano-eukaryotes: Nano high and Low FLR) from the Eastern English Channel (EEC) towards the southern North Sea, in international cross-border (UK, FR, BE, NL) common research cruises, following the spatial and temporal succession of spring blooms.
	- There is a need to increase the combined implementation of innovative and reference techniques both on current monitoring of discrete stations as well as in continuous automated measurements performed on cruises and ships of opportunity (as FerryBoxes), in order to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the surveys of the different eco-hydrodynamic regions of the area.
Â 
Kattegat and Skagerrak
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 3, 5, 6
	- Â Harmful algae, phytoplankton diversity and abundance were observed in near real time at an aquaculture site on the Swedish west coast. In situ imaging flow cytometry combined with machine learning and wireless communications provided data every 20 minutes.
	- Data from HF radar, FerryBox, research vessels and oceanographic buoys were used together with results from the 3D-NEMO Nordic ocean circulation model and remote sensing to describe the Kattegat-Skagerrak system.
	- Data from a FerryBox system revealed, as expected, the occurrence of strong concentration gradients reflecting progressive dilution along the South-North transect and highlighted harbours areas (Oslo and Kiel) as hotspots for some chemical compounds.
	- Microbial molecular markers representing bacterial species and genes were used to identify hydrocarbon pollution or high nutrient loads.
	- Barcoding of phytoplankton and bacteria revealed previously unknown diversity in the pelagic communities (see deliverable D3.8).
	- Carbon fluxes and carbonate system variability in the Skagerrak/Kattegat region is primarily driven by changes in salinity resulting from the balance of freshwater inputs from riverine and Baltic sources and saline waters from the Atlantic Ocean.
Â 
Baltic
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 5, 6
	- Different technologies for phytoplankton research have been successfully evaluated in the Baltic Sea. Operational monitoring of phycoerythrin fluorescence started after in-depth study during JRAP1, which identified different origins of this signal. To study filamentous cyanobacteria blooms, various sensors were tested and they were largely complementary. New absorption method seems to provide reliable estimates for Chlorophyll-a concentration, but still lacks automated maintenance procedures. Better understanding was obtained on the range of conversion factor between electron transport rate (measured with fluorescence induction) and carbon fixation rate, as well as of the reasons behind this variability.Â 
	- Carbonate system components of the Baltic Sea showed large seasonal variability indicating high impact of biological activity for pH and pCO2. Alkalinity of the Baltic Sea is difficult to model from other carbonate system components and online sensors are required to understand its variability.
	- The joint studies between different (multinational) research groups using different technologies provided good know-how exchange and should be encouraged. As well, multidisciplinary research efforts, including physics, chemistry, biology and modelling, should be encouraged, to gain knowledge on the environmental challenges more in detail.Â 
Â 
Norwegian Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 3, 6
	- The Norwegian Sea plays a major role as an area where potentially highly polluted waters from the North Sea mix with water transported from the North Atlantic Ocean. This water is then transported into the Arctic region. Analysis of the transport pathway of waterborne contaminants along the Norwegian coast was instrumental for assessing the spatial range of contaminants with different properties and address questions regarding exposure of the Arctic.
	- 42 currently used pesticides in Europe, 5 artificial sweeteners and 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products were targeted during the study. Several compounds were detected in the Norwegian Sea, including current use pesticides, artificial food additives and some pharmaceuticals. Their presence in this coastal area, and also in high-latitude more open waters, highlight the potential for these contaminants to undergo long range transport with marine currents.
	- Seasonal variability in temperature in the coastal area (up to a 15 ËC differential between summer and winter depending on latitude) is a large driving force on carbonate system variability, including a decrease in surface water fCO2 due to lower wintertime temperatures as well as the uptake of atmospheric CO2 as water cools during its northward journey from the North Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean.
	- In addition, a focal point was the improvement of systems that provides knowledge for the transport of parasites and harmful algae in the Norwegian Sea coastal area. Here the observations by FerryBoxes, fixed stations as well as repeated transects were used to validate and improve numerical model simulations.
Â 
Mediterranean Sea: Ligurian to Ibiza channel
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 4, 6
	- Major investigation effort was led in the Liguro-Provencal area and the Catalan Margin to study the variability of the Northern current through the combination of independent and complementary observational platforms. The dynamics of the boundary currents were studied to identify the interplay between various forcings (remote, thermohaline and wind), the generation of mesoscale and submesoscale instabilities, and data blending and assimilation techniques were investigated.
	- Major results have shown a clear correlation between hydrographic changes led by climatic interannual variability and the community composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The role of (sub)mesoscale processes have shown to modulate biochemical processes and to locally enhanced marine biomass productions/accumulation.
	- The multiplatform observing system in the NW Mediterranean Sea, combined with growing centralized frameworks of data management and distribution, i.e. Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service and SeaDataNet/SeaDataCloud, will provide the basis for an extended European coastal infrastructure.

Mediterranean Sea: Adriatic Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #5 & 6
	- During the project, important steps forward have been made on the development of capabilities to integrate new kinds of experimental data and oceanographic models to support ecosystem management. The implementation of an Adriatic oceanographic model assimilating surface current from coastal radar and temperature profiles from fishing vessels (FOOS fleet) has been developed and tested, providing encouraging results. Surface currents from coastal radars were integrated with results from drifter deployments to investigate zones of recruitment for small pelagic fishes, highlighting the role of remote areas in supporting the ecological role of these environments.
	- One year of high frequency data of sea surface pCO2 was successfully gathered at a fixed station in the northernmost Adriatic. Results highlighted how the biological CO2 uptake during phytoplankton blooms was able to keep the central basin a strong CO2 sink not only in winter, when low temperatures favor CO2 dissolution, but through most of the year, even when temperatures raised above 25Â°C.
	- The work carried on so far highlighted the potentiality of the area, where historical data and many observational systems are available to support both ecosystem management and advanced marine researches. On the other hand, they pointed out the need for integration of the existing facilities and observational systems also at a trans-border level to address the climate and ecological challenges facing this basin.

Mediterranean Sea: Cretan Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #2 & 6
	- An interesting case of how the additional assimilation of glider profiles and FerryBox observations used in the OSE experiment is beneficial for the Aegean Sea forecasting system in terms of reducing the system biases. This improved the sea surface salinity model bias over the south Aegean (north of Crete and south of 37Â°N).
	- In the Cretan Sea, the vertical migration of mesopelagic organisms (macroplanktonic and micronektonic) was observed by acoustical means for almost 2.5 years in the epipelagic and mesopelagic layers. The observed organisms were categorized into four groups according to their migration patterns which appeared to occur at diel and seasonal scale. The variability of the migration patterns was inspected in relation to the physical and biological environmental conditions of the study area. Stratification of the water column does not act as a barrier for the vertical motion of the strongest migrants that move up to 400 m every day. Instead, changes in light intensity (lunar cycle, daylight duration, cloudiness) and the presence of prey and predators seem to explain the observed daily, monthly and seasonal.

This report clearly demonstrates how the consortium of the project is willing to progress on monitoring strategies in several JERICO studies (besides the simulation experiments for transport studies, the analysis of search radius from contaminant sources and the use of covariance in highly relevant low-concentration persistent contaminants, use of multi-functional sensors, etc.); despite the difficulty and time-consuming activity of operating both fixed and mobile platforms working in the highly dynamic complex and densely utilised coastal areas. By progressing on the integration of scientific fields, it also shows the benefit of operating several platforms types (fixed & mobile, at sea, remote, & numerical). For instance, we can emphasize what deployments in JRAPs have proved:
	- JRAP #1: interest in deploying complementary observing systems for algal blooms to get information interoperable at EU level.
	- JRAP #2: success in monitoring highly dynamic benthic ecosystems.
	- JRAP #3: possibility to successfully perform monitoring of contaminants in an interoperable manner.
	- JRAP #4: the highly resolved low-cost sensor and mooring deployments for specific transport or contaminant studies, which shows the intent to be cost-efficient. The complementarity of remote + at sea and numerical systems.
	- JRAP#5: coastal carbon fluxes and biogeochemical cycling: The relatively large variability of conditions keeps being a challenge for sensor developers, with necessary periodic calibration needs that are possible to tackle as shown.
	- JRAP#6: makes a strong case of the need for in-situ data vs models, in particular for coastal processes.

A vision: a possible geographical structure of JERICO-RI per region and site
As a consequence, JERICO-RI already proved his capability to gather information and tools to qualify and quantify processes, their scales, related challenges and the possible solution to progress on. As a next step, in agreement with regional stakeholder, JERICO-RI should develop regional forum/center to share information (data and products), expertises, practices, solution and training in line with regional purposes to support scientists and regional stakeholders. This would support application of policies and regulations, based on applied collaborations between scientists and other stakeholders to tackle common societo, environmental and scientific questions from local to regional scales.
According to the monitoring purposes in regions and sites, the need of integration in scientific fields is diverse and JERICO-NEXT presented only a first steps. In the future, JRAPs, TNA & regions should engage with outermost regions where regional projects take place and could be liaised with JERICO RI to better connect these regions in the coastal observing RI landscape. Because of these considerations, the consortium progressed towards regional integrated coastal observatories and preliminary elements are presented in chapter 4.
A main lesson learned is that societal challenges and priorities at the regional level are important elements for the structuring of a coastal observing system. Therefore, a key challenge for the future is to improve regionalisation of the observatories for a better understanding of region-specific processes and an improved fit-for-purpose of the JERICO-RI. Furthermore, the observatories need to be consolidated in terms of performance, reliability and variables to optimally address and answer to key regional and pan-European environmental challenges. The two above-mentioned aspects are the integration challenge that the consortium wishes to tackle by implementing a regional structure of JERICO-RI.
The structuring process will be challenging because coastal observatories are not operated by the same organisations and therefore may have differing objectives and means of operation (financial, logistical, etc.). Based on these differences, we have proposed that the coastal observing systems in JERICO-RI can be structured hierarchically in which all sizes and types of coastal observatories can function in JERICO-RI in an integrated and mutually beneficial way. This will be reported in deliverable D1.4. This way towards a regional structuring of JERICO-RI is included in the proposal for the 3rd project of the JERICO series of projects, JERICO-S3, selected for funding during 4 years and to start in early 2020. With regards to the WP4 of the present project, the final deliverable: D4.5 is in progress to report results of each of the six JRAP activities and will be available by Sept. 2019 on the JERICO-RI website",science,973,not included

The advent of artificial intelligence, data mining, robotics, etc., has become a standard for successful business endeavors and is known as the âFourth Industrial Revolutionâ or âIndustry 4.0â in Europe. Data quality improvement through real-time multi-layer data fusion across interconnected networks and statistical quality assessment may improve the usefulness of databases maintained by these industries. Relational databases with a high degree of quality may be the gateway for predictive modeling and enhanced business analytics.	Data quality is a key issue in the sustainable bio-materials industry. Untreated data from multiple databases (e.g., sensor data and destructive test data) are generally not in the right structure to perform advanced analytics. Some inherent problems of data from sensors that are stored in data warehouses at millisecond intervals include missing values, duplicate records, sensor failure data (data out of feasible range), outliers, etc. These inherent problems of the untreated data represent information loss and mute predictive analytics. The goal of this data science focused research was to create a continuous real-time software algorithm for data cleaning that automatically aligns, fuses, and assesses data quality for missing fields and potential outliers. The program automatically reduces the variable size, imputes missing values, and predicts the destructive test data for every record in a database. Improved data quality was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and the normalized root mean square error of prediction (NRMSEP) statistic. 	The impact of outliers and missing data were tested on a simulated dataset with 201 variations of outlier percentages ranging from 0-90% and missing data percentages ranging from 0-90%.  The software program was also validated on a real dataset from the wood composites industry. One result of the research was that the number of sensors needed for accurate predictions are highly dependent on the correlation between independent variables and dependent variables. Overall, the data cleaning software program significantly decreased the NRMSEP ranging from 64% to 12% of quality control variables for key destructive test values (e.g., internal bond, water absorption and modulus of rupture)",science,974,not included

The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. 

The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. 

SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets.

As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data {of an heating distribution network and power consumption data} collected in a major Italian city.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of~buildings",science,976,not included

This project aims to explore the implementation and operation of the Sucupira Aquaculture Park (PAS) of the Lajeado Hydroelectric Power Plant (Palmas / TO) through the use of multicriteria decision methods, aiming at a socioenvironmental approach of the risk factors of the implementation of this project through the proposition of sustainability indicators. Scientometry has demonstrated that the production of knowledge related to fish culture in net tanks and artisanal fishing in reservoirs is indexed and has a multidisciplinary character. The articles are technicist and productivist, with little regard for environmental and socioeconomic factors, nor the public policies for the development and promotion of fishery and fishery activities, which in a way explains the dissatisfaction with the activity by the fish farmers of the Bom Peixe Association , as well as the inefficiency of the public policy of transforming the artisanal fisherman into an entrepreneur. The Social Network Analysis (ARS) makes clear that there is interconnection among all actors, but the protagonism of this network is dominated by public institutions and the process of communication between the various institutional actors is two-way, while between fish farmers and fishermen is of a unidirectional character, making them only subjects of actions. The Trophic State Index (EIT) was used as a monitoring tool for aquaculture activities in PAS. Limnological variables, with the exception of total phosphorus, despite small variations of oxygen and total solids, are in accordance with the recommendations of CONAMA Resolution 357/05. The data allow us to conclude that the aquaculture area presented a predominance of supereutrophic trophic state and that the trophic state of the reservoir in the vicinity of the tanks is strongly influenced by anthropic activities, mainly in the rainy season. In the dry season, there is an increase in the phosphorus concentration in the water, leading to a hypereutrophic state. It is not possible to say that aquaculture is an impactful activity and its effects are difficult to predict in the long term, as well as the behavior of the reservoir through increased production in the parks, however, if there is no monitoring and efficient control over water quality , fish farming may promote degradation of the aquatic ecosystem. The analysis of the technical, economic and financial feasibility of investment in aquaculture projects of tambaqui production in network tanks used the economic indicators Effective Operational Cost (COE), Total Operating Cost (COT), Total Gross Income (RBT), Gross Margin (MB), Net Margin (ML), Profit (L) and Return Rate of Capital (TRC). The analysis of TRC presented negative results and the system of production in excavated nurseries proved to be more efficient. The system of production in network tanks is an alternative of lower cost and time of implantation, but with uncertain return. The socioeconomic profile of the producers is considered to be incompatible with the business and technological activity of aquaculture in network tanks. In the producers' view, the activity is still a future promise and the public policy of turning fishermen into fish farmers proved ineffective. According to TRC, the activity is unsustainable and has been showing negative results, which indicates its low competitiveness. Sustainability and governance indicators were developed for the development of fish farming in the PAS, which, through social, economic and environmental subindices, generated a Sustainability Index (ISUS) of the enterprise. The data allowed to conclude that the ISUS was classified as not very sustainable (0.37), mainly in the economic and social dimensions. The analysis of governance was identified in interviews with the main agents of the productive chain, making it clear that the lack of governance structures was noticeable in all segments analyzed, which portrays the real stage of disorganization and inefficiency of the productive chain of fish farming in PAS.Este estudo deriva da polÃ­tica do governo brasileiro para incremento da produÃ§Ã£o de pescado por meio do fomento Ã  piscicultura em tanques rede nos parques aquÃ­colas.

A AnÃ¡lise de Redes Sociais (ARS) deixa claro que hÃ¡ interligaÃ§Ã£o entre todos os atores, porÃ©m o protagonismo dessa rede estÃ¡ dominado por instituiÃ§Ãµes pÃºblicas e o processo de comunicaÃ§Ã£o entre os diversos atores institucionais Ã© de carÃ¡ter bidirecional, enquanto que entre os piscicultores e pescadores Ã© de carÃ¡ter unidirecional, tornando-os apenas sujeitos das aÃ§Ãµes. O Ãndice de Estado TrÃ³fico (IET) foi utilizado como ferramenta de monitoramento de atividades aquÃ­colas no PAS. As variÃ¡veis limnolÃ³gicas, com exceÃ§Ã£o do fÃ³sforo total, apesar das pequenas variaÃ§Ãµes de oxigÃªnio e sÃ³lidos totais, estÃ£o de acordo com as recomendaÃ§Ãµes da ResoluÃ§Ã£o CONAMA 357/05. Os dados permitem concluir que a Ã¡rea aquÃ­cola apresentou predominÃ¢ncia de estado trÃ³fico supereutrÃ³fico e que o estado trÃ³fico do reservatÃ³rio nas proximidades dos tanques rede sofre forte influÃªncia externa de atividades antrÃ³picas, principalmente no perÃ­odo chuvoso. No perÃ­odo da seca, ocorre aumento na concentraÃ§Ã£o de fÃ³sforo na Ã¡gua, levando a um estado hipereutrÃ³fico. NÃ£o Ã© possÃ­vel afirmar que a aquicultura seja uma atividade impactante e seus efeitos sÃ£o difÃ­ceis de serem previstos em longo prazo, bem como o comportamento do reservatÃ³rio mediante aumento de produÃ§Ã£o nos parques, porÃ©m, caso nÃ£o haja monitoramento e controle eficiente sobre a qualidade da Ã¡gua, a piscicultura pode vir a promover degradaÃ§Ã£o do ecossistema aquÃ¡tico. A anÃ¡lise da viabilidade tÃ©cnica, econÃ´mica e financeira de investimento em projetos aquÃ­colas de produÃ§Ã£o de tambaqui em tanques rede utilizou os indicadores econÃ´micos Custo Operacional Efetivo (COE), Custo Operacional Total (COT), Renda Bruta Total (RBT), Margem Bruta (MB), Margem LÃ­quida (ML), Lucro (L) e Taxa de Retorno do Capital (TRC). A anÃ¡lise da TRC apresentou resultados negativos e o sistema de produÃ§Ã£o em viveiros escavados se mostrou mais eficiente. O sistema de produÃ§Ã£o em tanques rede Ã© uma alternativa de menor custo e tempo de implantaÃ§Ã£o, porÃ©m com retorno incerto. O perfil socioeconÃ´mico dos produtores Ã© considerado incompatÃ­vel com a atividade empresarial e tecnificada de aquicultura em tanques rede. Na visÃ£o dos produtores a atividade ainda Ã© uma promessa futura e a polÃ­tica pÃºblica de transformar pescadores em piscicultores se mostrou ineficaz. De acordo com a TRC, a atividade Ã© insustentÃ¡vel e vem apresentando resultados negativos, o que denota sua baixa competitividade.

This potential can be realized to its maximum only when data science becomes democratized, instead of centralized in a small group of expert data scientists. However, with data becoming more massive and heterogeneous, standing in stark contrast to the spreading demand of data science is the growing gap between human users and data: Every type of data requires extensive specialized training, either to learn a specific query language or a data analytics software. Towards the democratization of data science, in this dissertation we systematically investigate a promising research direction, natural language interface, to bridge the gap between users and data, and make it easier for users who are less technically proficient to access the data analytics power needed for on-demand problem solving and decision making.One of the largest obstacles for general users to access data is the proficiency requirement on formal languages (e.g., SQL) that machines use. Automatically parsing natural language commands from users into formal languages, natural language interfaces can thus play a critical role in democratizing data science. However, a pressing question that is largely left unanswered so far is, how to bootstrap a natural language interface for a new domain? The high cost of data collection and the data-hungry nature of the mainstream neural network models are significantly limiting the wide application of natural language interfaces. The main technical contribution of this dissertation is a systematic framework for bootstrapping natural language interfaces for new domains. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three complimentary methods: (1) Collecting data at a low cost via crowdsourcing, (2) leveraging existing NLI data from other domains via transfer learning, and (3) letting a bootstrapped model to interact with real users so that it can refine itself over time. Combining the three methods forms a closed data loop for bootstrapping and refining natural language interfaces for any domain.The developed methodologies and frameworks in this dissertation hence pave the path for building data science platforms that everyone can use to process, query, and analyze their data without extensive specialized training. With such AI-powered platforms, users can stay focused on high-level thinking and decision making, instead of overwhelmed by low-level implementation and programming details --- ``\emph{Let machines understand human thinking. Don't let humans think like machines}.'",science,978,not included

By planning for tasks in the same order that they are later executed, total-order HTN planners always know the complete state of the world at each planning step. This enables writing more expressive planning domains than what is possible in partial-order HTN planning, such as preconditions with calls to external procedures.Such features have facilitated the use of total-order HTN planners in agent systems and seen them excel in AI games.This paper describes the Hierarchical Agent-based Task Planner (HATP), a total-order HTN planner. Since its first implementation, HATP has had various extensions and integrations over the years, such as support for splitting a solution into multiple streams and assigning them to the agents in the domain; modelling their beliefs as distinct world states; allowing âsocial rulesâ to be included by the user to define what kind of agent behaviour is appropriate; allowing tasks to be planned by taking the humanâs safety and comfort into account; and to interleave HTN and geometric planning.Since many of these implementations have remained prototypes, we have significantly enhanced them as well as HATP itself, and integrated them into a stand-alone HATP distribution, which is now available as open source software (under a BSD 2-Clause License).This paper presents some of our recent improvements to HATP, and gives an overview of its user-friendly language, which treats agents as distinct entities; its mechanisms for effective control over decomposition; and its integration into our robotics framewor",science,981,not included

This project aims to explore the implementation and operation of the Sucupira Aquaculture Park (PAS) of the Lajeado Hydroelectric Power Plant (Palmas / TO) through the use of multicriteria decision methods, aiming at a socioenvironmental approach of the risk factors of the implementation of this project through the proposition of sustainability indicators. Scientometry has demonstrated that the production of knowledge related to fish culture in net tanks and artisanal fishing in reservoirs is indexed and has a multidisciplinary character. The articles are technicist and productivist, with little regard for environmental and socioeconomic factors, nor the public policies for the development and promotion of fishery and fishery activities, which in a way explains the dissatisfaction with the activity by the fish farmers of the Bom Peixe Association , as well as the inefficiency of the public policy of transforming the artisanal fisherman into an entrepreneur. The Social Network Analysis (ARS) makes clear that there is interconnection among all actors, but the protagonism of this network is dominated by public institutions and the process of communication between the various institutional actors is two-way, while between fish farmers and fishermen is of a unidirectional character, making them only subjects of actions. The Trophic State Index (EIT) was used as a monitoring tool for aquaculture activities in PAS. Limnological variables, with the exception of total phosphorus, despite small variations of oxygen and total solids, are in accordance with the recommendations of CONAMA Resolution 357/05. The data allow us to conclude that the aquaculture area presented a predominance of supereutrophic trophic state and that the trophic state of the reservoir in the vicinity of the tanks is strongly influenced by anthropic activities, mainly in the rainy season. In the dry season, there is an increase in the phosphorus concentration in the water, leading to a hypereutrophic state. It is not possible to say that aquaculture is an impactful activity and its effects are difficult to predict in the long term, as well as the behavior of the reservoir through increased production in the parks, however, if there is no monitoring and efficient control over water quality , fish farming may promote degradation of the aquatic ecosystem. The analysis of the technical, economic and financial feasibility of investment in aquaculture projects of tambaqui production in network tanks used the economic indicators Effective Operational Cost (COE), Total Operating Cost (COT), Total Gross Income (RBT), Gross Margin (MB), Net Margin (ML), Profit (L) and Return Rate of Capital (TRC). The analysis of TRC presented negative results and the system of production in excavated nurseries proved to be more efficient. The system of production in network tanks is an alternative of lower cost and time of implantation, but with uncertain return. The socioeconomic profile of the producers is considered to be incompatible with the business and technological activity of aquaculture in network tanks. In the producers' view, the activity is still a future promise and the public policy of turning fishermen into fish farmers proved ineffective. According to TRC, the activity is unsustainable and has been showing negative results, which indicates its low competitiveness. Sustainability and governance indicators were developed for the development of fish farming in the PAS, which, through social, economic and environmental subindices, generated a Sustainability Index (ISUS) of the enterprise. The data allowed to conclude that the ISUS was classified as not very sustainable (0.37), mainly in the economic and social dimensions. The analysis of governance was identified in interviews with the main agents of the productive chain, making it clear that the lack of governance structures was noticeable in all segments analyzed, which portrays the real stage of disorganization and inefficiency of the productive chain of fish farming in PAS.Este estudo deriva da polÃ­tica do governo brasileiro para incremento da produÃ§Ã£o de pescado por meio do fomento Ã  piscicultura em tanques rede nos parques aquÃ­colas. Este projeto visa explorar a implantaÃ§Ã£o e operaÃ§Ã£o do Parque AquÃ­cola Sucupira (PAS) da UHE Lajeado (Palmas/TO) atravÃ©s do uso de mÃ©todos multicritÃ©rios de decisÃ£o, com objetivo de realizar uma abordagem socioambiental dos fatores de risco da implantaÃ§Ã£o deste empreendimento atravÃ©s da proposiÃ§Ã£o de indicadores de sustentabilidade. A cienciometria, demonstrou que a produÃ§Ã£o de conhecimento relacionado ao cultivo de peixes em tanques rede e a pesca artesanal em reservatÃ³rios estÃ¡ indexada e Ã© de carÃ¡ter multidisciplinar. Os artigos possuem carÃ¡ter tecnicista e produtivista, pouco considerando os fatores ambientais e sÃ³cio econÃ´micos, nem tampouco as polÃ­ticas pÃºblicas de desenvolvimento e fomento Ã s atividades piscÃ­colas e ou pesqueiras, o que de certa forma explica a insatisfaÃ§Ã£o com a atividade pelos piscicultores da AssociaÃ§Ã£o Bom Peixe, bem como a ineficiÃªncia da polÃ­tica pÃºblica de transformar o pescador artesanal em empreendedor. A AnÃ¡lise de Redes Sociais (ARS) deixa claro que hÃ¡ interligaÃ§Ã£o entre todos os atores, porÃ©m o protagonismo dessa rede estÃ¡ dominado por instituiÃ§Ãµes pÃºblicas e o processo de comunicaÃ§Ã£o entre os diversos atores institucionais Ã© de carÃ¡ter bidirecional, enquanto que entre os piscicultores e pescadores Ã© de carÃ¡ter unidirecional, tornando-os apenas sujeitos das aÃ§Ãµes. O Ãndice de Estado TrÃ³fico (IET) foi utilizado como ferramenta de monitoramento de atividades aquÃ­colas no PAS. As variÃ¡veis limnolÃ³gicas, com exceÃ§Ã£o do fÃ³sforo total, apesar das pequenas variaÃ§Ãµes de oxigÃªnio e sÃ³lidos totais, estÃ£o de acordo com as recomendaÃ§Ãµes da ResoluÃ§Ã£o CONAMA 357/05. Os dados permitem concluir que a Ã¡rea aquÃ­cola apresentou predominÃ¢ncia de estado trÃ³fico supereutrÃ³fico e que o estado trÃ³fico do reservatÃ³rio nas proximidades dos tanques rede sofre forte influÃªncia externa de atividades antrÃ³picas, principalmente no perÃ­odo chuvoso. No perÃ­odo da seca, ocorre aumento na concentraÃ§Ã£o de fÃ³sforo na Ã¡gua, levando a um estado hipereutrÃ³fico. NÃ£o Ã© possÃ­vel afirmar que a aquicultura seja uma atividade impactante e seus efeitos sÃ£o difÃ­ceis de serem previstos em longo prazo, bem como o comportamento do reservatÃ³rio mediante aumento de produÃ§Ã£o nos parques, porÃ©m, caso nÃ£o haja monitoramento e controle eficiente sobre a qualidade da Ã¡gua, a piscicultura pode vir a promover degradaÃ§Ã£o do ecossistema aquÃ¡tico. A anÃ¡lise da viabilidade tÃ©cnica, econÃ´mica e financeira de investimento em projetos aquÃ­colas de produÃ§Ã£o de tambaqui em tanques rede utilizou os indicadores econÃ´micos Custo Operacional Efetivo (COE), Custo Operacional Total (COT), Renda Bruta Total (RBT), Margem Bruta (MB), Margem LÃ­quida (ML), Lucro (L) e Taxa de Retorno do Capital (TRC). A anÃ¡lise da TRC apresentou resultados negativos e o sistema de produÃ§Ã£o em viveiros escavados se mostrou mais eficiente. O sistema de produÃ§Ã£o em tanques rede Ã© uma alternativa de menor custo e tempo de implantaÃ§Ã£o, porÃ©m com retorno incerto. O perfil socioeconÃ´mico dos produtores Ã© considerado incompatÃ­vel com a atividade empresarial e tecnificada de aquicultura em tanques rede. Na visÃ£o dos produtores a atividade ainda Ã© uma promessa futura e a polÃ­tica pÃºblica de transformar pescadores em piscicultores se mostrou ineficaz. De acordo com a TRC, a atividade Ã© insustentÃ¡vel e vem apresentando resultados negativos, o que denota sua baixa competitividade. Foram elaborados indicadores de sustentabilidade e governanÃ§a para o desenvolvimento da piscicultura no PAS, que atravÃ©s de subÃ­ndices sociais, econÃ´micos e ambientais geraram um Ãndice de Sustentabilidade (ISUS) do empreendimento. Os dados permitiram concluir que o ISUS foi classificado como pouco sustentÃ¡vel (0,37), principalmente nas dimensÃµes econÃ´micas e sociais. A anÃ¡lise de governanÃ§a foi identificada em entrevistas aos principais agentes da cadeia produtiva, ficando claro que a falta de estruturas de governanÃ§a foi perceptÃ­vel em todos os segmentos analisados, o que retrata o real estagio de desorganizaÃ§Ã£o e ineficiÃªncia da cadeia produtiva da piscicultura no PAS",science,982,not included

The aim of the article. The aim of the article is structural analysis of modern innovations in preparing and presenting corporate reporting and researching the prospects of their application based on the theory of diffusion of innovations The results of the analysis. Innovation diffusion theory as in instrument of interdisciplinary analysis allows to describe key parameters in spreading of actual accounting, audit and corporate reporting innovations, for example: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity of innovation, trialability and observability. Located in the order of accounting cycle (accounting of
different types of operations, reporting after the end of the period, and rendering an auditorâs opinion), discussed technological innovations give an idea about the prospects of modern system of corporate reporting. Big data, accounting for Environmental, Social and corporate Governance â criteria, preparation and presentation of integrated reporting, real-time reporting, conducting continuous audit with computer assisted audit technologies (CAAT), Global General Accepted Accounting Principles (GGAAP) and development of XBRL are the typical technological innovations that accompany the transformation corporate reporting process based on a new paradigm. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Big data is not only the product of accounting and reporting in real time, but also the basis for the continuous audit of the real-time reporting with advanced analytical technologies â CAAT. Taking into
account ESG-criteria in the course of business, the implementation of responsible investment requires the development of appropriate indicators and its accounting measurement for the demonstration of progress in achieving sustainability and corporate social responsibility. This ESG-criteria and indicator (non-financial information), spreading real-time reporting lead to the emergence of integrated reporting. It causes changes in approaches to public audit and confirmation of this type of reporting with the CAAT, artificial intelligence systems. GGAAP development, improvement of methodology of integrated reporting standards and International Standards on Quality, Control, Auditing, Review Other Assurance and Related Services acts as a response to the need to restoring confidence in the reporting on globalized financial marketsand independent verification of its quality. XBRL as a technology innovation serving as connecting-link the one that helps transmit understandable reporting to all stakeholders, minimizing the time and costs for its processing and analysis through the taxonomy. The combination of considered innovation are grounded necessitates of construction of convergent model of accounting, reporting and auditing, which fully meets the information needs of stakeholders on globalized financial markets and with the spreading of sustainability concept",science,984,not included

SPEC exploits a data stream methodology analysis over a sliding time window to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The building model is then exploited to predict the upcoming energy consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC currently integrates the artificial neural networks technique and the random forest regression algorithm. The SPEC methodology exploits the computational advantages of distributed computing frameworks as the current implementation runs on Spark.

The publication of the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) opens a new era in astronomy. It includes precise astrometric data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) for more than 1.3 billion sources, mostly stars. To analyse such a vast amount of new data, the use of data-mining techniques and machine-learning algorithms is mandatory.Aims. A great example of the application of such techniques and algorithms is the search for open clusters (OCs), groups of stars that were born and move together, located in the disc. Our aim is to develop a method to automatically explore the data space, requiring minimal manual intervention.Methods. We explore the performance of a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to find clusters in the data together with a supervised learning method such as an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically distinguish between real OCs and statistical clusters.Results. The development and implementation of this method in a five-dimensional space (l, b, Ï, Î¼Î±*, Î¼Î´) with the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, and a posterior validation using Gaia DR2 data, lead to the proposal of a set of new nearby OCs.

They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as ~1% for simulated and ~2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely tho nds of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as a user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort. By facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope",science,988,not included

Computerized Medical Record in the diagnostic-care of the Rare Diseases: development and implementation of a system for the collection and analysis of clinical phenotypic and genotypic data,2016-01-29 00:00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/78395279.pdf,,"Internationally there is no single definition of a rare disease: in European countries and beyond is determined on the basis of different thresholds of prevalence, in accordance with regulatory requirements: in the European Union (EU), a disease is rare if it has a population prevalence of less than or equal to 1/2000 inhabitants (0.05 %). Rare diseases, from a clinical and epidemiological point of view-, are a very heterogeneous group, with about 5000-8000 entities, mostly with genetic origin, often severe, chronically debilitating, progressive and potentially fatal, representing a major public health problem; nevertheless, in the past, have received little scientific interest, are hardly included in international classifications and barely visible at the level of health information, for many of them also epidemiologic data are not yet available. The main reason seems to be the absence of a system of correct coding and traceability in health information systems: the existing classification systems for collecting phenotypic and genotypic data, are widely heterogeneous, lacking a standard terminology, slightly inter-operable, solely dedicated to the classification of the phenotype or supplied with database features of variants and related phenotypes profiles. Some of these databases are already operating, other developing, along with the implementation of NGS technologies, which guaranteed the medical scientific community, compared to traditional techniques, the study of a wide range of genetic diseases, with the collapse of cost and time of data analysis. Worldwide were established centers and research projects in highly specialized techniques of genome sequencing and development of databases of genomic variants, that have made available a large variety and quantity of new information, often difficult to manage and interpret. The commitment of the scientific community is therefore the systematic organization of that huge amount of data, potentially useful to the correct interpretation of the pathogenic significance of genomic variants in relation to the clinical phenotype. Based on emerging data from the literature, the records of patients and pathologies constitute interesting tools for the development of knowledge useful for the clinical and epidemiological aspect and in the field of rare diseases. Many existing registers must address issues of quality, accessibility and standardization of data, optimization of resources, and interoperability, related to fragmentation of coding systems of diseases. The situation on European and international scene seems to favor the establishment of global registers or common platforms for coordination of all existing and future registers, following a uniform approach, coordinated and of the highest quality. The implementation of this model is currently a strategic objective of the European community within the project EPIRARE and of the US community in the project on Global Rare Diseases Registry (GRDR). In the evolutionary path that supports the implementation of the public health service to improve the exercise of the right to healthcare of citizens, the current development of innovative information technologies, which make available comprehensive information, shared and able to guarantee citizens the best continuity of care, is critical. In Italy, the Electronic Health Record (FSE) is the computerized collection of data of the clinical history of an individual, designed as part of the National Health Service (SSN) according to the National Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health in November 2010. The process is slow, but with the introduction of the SFE is to be hoped that in the near future, we witness a revolutionary change in the relationship between health infrastructure and citizen, so far characterized by communication barriers, rigid and cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and paperwork with improvement of the flow of data and the diagnostic process and healthcare. Also in the international context is documented the usefulness of the so-called ""Electronic Health Record"" (EHR) or ""Personal Health Record"" (PHR) to assist this process in healthcare, as well as for measuring and monitoring the quality of care and for translational research, but the construction and development of the FSE are still at a preliminary stage and the challenges of making the application infrastructure are numerous, especially for developing countries.

Another major challenge on many fronts to health systems in the field of rare diseases is that represented by the heterogeneous group of patients without diagnosis, individuals with known diseases incorrectly recognized, experiencing delays and diagnostic errors, or individuals with unknown diseases; these patients over-use inadequate diagnostic pathways and their care needs are not satisfied, with high human and social costs.

To date the problem of patients without diagnosis was universally recognized worldwide as central, to the planning of health care networks for patients with a rare disease, but its still unresolved: the attempts made in the USA with Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) of National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical Center have shown promising results, but appeared poorly sustainable in clinical practice and still have limited epidemiological value.

Nationally some Accredited Centres for excellence in the diagnosis and treatment of specific rare diseases or groups of related rare diseases, have established projects targeted on finding solutions to methodological collection of clinical phenotype-genotype correspondence, supporting the diagnostic process of patients with rare diseases, with special attention to patients without a diagnosis or with a generic presumptive diagnosis: Region-University research Project ""Next Generation Sequencing and Gene Therapy to diagnose and Cure rare Diseases in Emilia Romagna (rarer)"" and Ministerial Project ""A multicenter collaborative research network for the identification and study of rare undiagnosed patients: the impact on the rare disease National Health Service network (UnRareNet)"".

In the broader context of these research projects present PhD project designed to create a unique collection of analytical data, describing phenotype and genotype features of patients with known or suspected diagnosis, between groups of selected rare diseases, based on a computerized platform, with implementation of the model of the Regional Registry for Rare Diseases, already used in the Veneto Region.

A further objective was the creation of a specific product useful for clinical management in the field of rare diseases, especially with respect to efficiency, speed and accuracy of diagnostic assessment, through the transfer of the instrument for collection of clinical phenotype-genotype data in patients with diseases or groups of selected rare diseases in the form of generalized Computerized Medical Record (CCI).

The form CCI should have features which cut across rare diseases registry and the hospital medical records, dedicated to a single episode of care, and should structur on the emerging pattern of computerized personal health record, such as in Italy, the ""Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico"".

The added value is the integration of the relational database research potential with the clinical applications of CCI in the practical management and care of patients with rare diseases. It was also planned the networking of CCI as part of a shared use of clinical, genetic and healthcare data in real contexts of clinical excellence, such as those offered by the RARER and UnRareNet projects.

The project is structured in three different phases:

1. identification and sharing, within the common RARER protocol, of a suitable methodology for the construction of 8 different disease registries, with implementation of the clinical database and structuring a form of collection of genotypic data; 

2. realization and network sharing of module CCI such as a sustainable product in a clinical setting, containing clinical information in a relational database; 

3. implementation of the acquisition data system and module CCI, with the expansion of the patient population in the context of the project UnRareNet, data analysis, identifying the correlation between genotype and phenotype pictures, and design of an expert system able to manage complex procedures for data processing. 

The research project proposed the implementation of a relational database with the collection through CCI of clinical data in patients with rare diseases with known or suspected diagnosis, in the context of some rare diseases of specific interest.

The clinical entities and major and minor entities, describing phenotype and genotype features are classified in the database according to a classificatory nodular and multihierarchical like a tree method, which integrates uni and multidimensional internationally recognized classification systems and, at the same timem respects the anatomical structure and function of the human organism.

The database includes 72,360 records, distributed between the main and secondary entities (signs, symptoms, comorbidity, impairments, diagnostic, attributes) and relationships between entities, 117 different clinical entities, 63 different genes and 1,186 total patients. The results obtained during the development and implementation of the system of collection of clinical information, with the implementation of the module CCI in the context of the project RARER, have proved the usability of the product in a preliminary context; the expansion of the clinical application in the context of the project UnRareNet, has produced promising results and the system showed a good performance in terms of similar and dissimilar phenotypes, managing fully clinical information regarding total number of different rare diseases and proving thus be generalized flexible and interoperable. The data are still limited at the time, but having analytical characteristics pre-coded, are immediately usable for future complex processing. The collection of genetic information and integration with clinical information appeared feasible with promising results, although the project UnRareNet this is still absolutely at a preliminary stage; patients without diagnosis is about 10% of the total, but more than half of them do not yet have genetic investigation, which proved to be useful to confirm the diagnosis in 53% of cases with known disease. On the total sample of patients, the use of NGS technologies seems to be limited at this stage, but the results highlight the potential of the modern techniques of genome sequencing in the implementation of the diagnostic process; expanding the population of patients enrolled and the targeted application of these new technologies could allow wider knowledge on the phenotypic and genotypic profile of the considered diseases. Having a broader patient population, the creation of the expert system, of which the foundations were laid in the context of this project, will be possible through the collection of theoretical frequencies of clinical and diagnostic findings of some groups of rare diseases related (metabolic, mitochondrial), arising from the international literature and to be included in the system for processing of clinical scenarios. The expert system will allow the validation of diagnoses simulated by collecting new cases with known diagnosis, and the formulation of new diagnoses of known diseases or identification of new clinical entities, even with use of neural networks or Kohonen networks and Fuzzy methods. The methodology for collecting phenotypic and genotypic information in patients with rare diseases, proposed in this PhD project, proved sufficient to satisfy the requirements of applicability and suggested a number of future applications, which aim the expansion of knowledge on genomic variability of rare diseases and to reduce the number of patients without a diagnosis",science,990,not included

The seismicity in Italy is of course variable in time and space, being also very much dependant on local noise conditions. Specifically, monitoring seismicity in an alluvial basin like the Po one is a challenge, due to consistent site effects induced by soft alluvial deposits and bad coupling with the deep bedrock (Steidl et al., 1996). This problem was tackled by INGV first with the Cavola experiment (Bordoni et al., 2007), where a landslide was seismically characterized using a seismic array and also down-hole logging of P- and S-wave travel times at a borehole drilled within the array; later, with an ad hoc project in 2000-2001, with the first installation of a broad band seismic station nearby Ferrara in a borehole of 135 meters depth. Comparison of recordings with a surface seismic station indicated a noise reduction of 2 decades in power spectral density at frequencies larger than 1.0 Hz (Cocco et al., 2001). The instrumentation in Ferrara has been working for several months but after that the seismic station was discontinued due to lack of maintenance manpower.
The Centro di Ricerche Sismologiche (CRS, Seismological Research Center) of the Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS, Italian National Institute for Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics) in Udine (Italy) after the strong earthquake of magnitude M=6.4 occurred in 1976 in the Italian Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, started to operate the Northeastern Italy (NI) Seismic Network: it currently consists of 15 very sensitive broad band and 21 simpler short period seismic stations, all telemetered to and acquired in real time at the OGS-CRS data center in Udine (Fig. 1).
Real time data exchange agreements in place with other Italian, Slovenian, Austrian and Swiss seismological institutes lead to a total number of about 100 seismic stations acquired in real time, which makes the OGS the reference institute for seismic monitoring of Northeastern Italy. Since 2002 OGS-CRS is using the Antelope software suite on several workstations plus a SUN cluster as the main tool for collecting, analyzing, archiving and exchanging seismic data, initially in the framework of the EU Interreg IIIA project âTrans-national seismological networks in the South-Eastern Alpsâ. SeisComP is also used as a real time data exchange server tool (Bragato et al., 2011).
Among the various Italian institution with which OGS is cooperating for real time monitoring of local seismicity there is the Regione Veneto (Barnaba et al., 2012). The Southern part of the Veneto Region stands on the Po alluvial basin: earthquake localization and characterization is here again affected in this area by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. OGS ha already experience in running a local seismic network in difficult noise conditions making use of borehole installations (Priolo et al., 2012) in the case of the monitoring of a local storage site for the Italian national electricity company ENEL. Following the ML=5.9 earthquake that struck the Emilia region around Ferrara in Northern Italy on May 20, 2012 at 02:03:53 UTC, a cooperation of INGV, OGS, the Comune di Ferrara and the University of Ferrara lead to the reinstallation of the very broad band borehole seismic station in Ferrara. The aim of the OGS intervention was on one hand to extend its real time seismic monitoring capabilities toward South-East (Fig. 1), including Ferrara and its surroundings, and on the other hand to evaluate the seismic  response at the site.
As concerns the superficial geology of the area where the borehole seismic station  has been installed, the outcropping materials are represented by alluvial deposits of different environments, like channel and proximal levee, inter-fluvial, meander and swamps deposits. As  a consequence, the outcropping deposits are everywhere Holocene in age substantially loose or poorly compacted in the first meters-decameters and granulometrically could vary from clay to coarse sand.
Two preliminary reports prepared by the Italian Department of Civil Defense (Dipartimento Nazionale di Protezione Civile) in collaboration with other institutions describe the data  recorded by the national accelerometric network and complemented by additional data recorded by a number of temporary stations (Dolce et al., 2012a; Dolce et al., 2012b). These reports bear witness of strong ground motion values with an acceleration peak of about 0.9 g in the vertical component recorded during the ML=5.8 earthquake of May 29, 2012 by the Mirandola station, located at about 2 km from the epicentre. The analysis of the seismic noise recorded at some stations shows a quite pronounced peak of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) in the frequency range of 0.6 â 0.9 Hz common to all stations. Finally, strong evidence of liquefaction phenomena are reported at several sites (e.g.: S. Carlo, S. Agostino and Mirabello), most of which have been attributed to the occurrence of saturated sandy layer(s) at shallow depth deposited along an abandoned reach of the Reno River (Papathanassiou et al., 2012).

Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques can be of great help when applied to surface electromyography signals to offer a natural control based on the contraction of muscles corresponding to the real movements. The implementation of such approach for an active prosthetic system offers many challenges related to the reliability of data collected to train the classification algorithm.

By so doing, the decision making capabilities of each of these agents should be improved by making decisions that take into account what the remaining agents intend to do. Against this background, the focus of this thesis is to study and design new coordination algorithms capable of achieving this improved performance.In this line of work, there are two key research challenges that need to be addressed. First, the current state-of-the-art coordination algorithms have only been tested in simulation. This means that their practical performance still needs to be demonstrated in the real world. Second, none of the existing algorithms are capable of solving problems where the agents need to coordinate over complex decisions which typically require to trade off several parameters such as multiple objectives, the parameters of a sufficient statistic and the sample value and the bounds of an estimator. However, such parameters typically characterise the agentsâ interactions within many real world domains. For this reason, deriving algorithms capable of addressing such complex interactions is a key challenge to bring research in coordination algorithms one step closer to successful deployment.The aim of this thesis is to address these two challenges. To achieve this, we make two types of contribution. First, we develop a set practical contributions to address the challenge of testing the performance of state-of-the-art coordination algorithms in the real world. More specifically, we perform a case study on the deployment of the max-sum algorithm, a well known coordination algorithm, on a system that is couched in terms of allowing the first responders at the scene of a disaster to request imagery collection tasks of some of the most relevant areas to a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These agents then coordinate to complete the largest number of tasks. In more detail, max-sum is based on the generalised distributive law (GDL), a well known algebraic framework that has been used in disciplines such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistical physics, to derive effective algorithms to solve optimisation problems. Our iv contribution is the deployment of max-sum on real hardware and the evaluation of its performance in a real world setting. More specifically, we deploy max-sum on two UAVs (hexacopters) and test it a number of different settings. These tests show that max-sum does indeed perform well when confronted with the complexity and the unpredictability of the real world.The second category of contributions are theoretical in nature. More specifically, we propose a new framework and a set of solution techniques to address the complex interactions requirement. To achieve this, we move back to theory and tackle a new class of problem involving agents engaged in complex interactions defined by multiple parameters. We name this class partially ordered distributed constraint optimisation problems (PO-DCOPs). Essentially, this generalises the well known distributed constraint optimisation problem (DCOP) framework to settings in which agents make decisions over multiple parameters such as multiple objectives, the parameters of a sufficient statistic and the sample value and the bounds of an estimator. To measure the quality of these decisions, it becomes necessary to strike a balance between these parameters and to achieve this, the outcome of these decisions is represented using partially ordered constraint functions.Given this framework, we present three sub-classes of PO-DCOPs, each focusing on a different type of complex interaction. More specifically, we study (i) multi-objective DCOPs (MO-DCOPs) in which the agentsâ decisions are defined over multiple objectives, (ii) risk-aware DCOPs (RA-DCOPs) in which the outcome of the agentsâ decisions is not known with certainty and thus, where the agents need to carefully weigh the risk of making decisions that might lead to poor and unexpected outcomes and, (iii) multiarm bandit DCOPs (MAB-DCOPs) where the agents need to learn the outcome of their decisions online. To solve these problems, we again exploit the GDL framework. In particular, we employ the flexibility of the GDL to obtain either optimal or bounded approximate algorithms to solve PO-DCOPs. The key insight is to use the algebraic properties of the GDL to instantiate well known DCOP algorithms such as DPOP, Action GDL or bounded max-sum to solve PO-DCOPs. Given the properties of these algorithms, we derive a new set of solution techniques. To demonstrate their effectiveness, we study the properties of these algorithms empirically on various instances of MO-DCOPs, RA-DCOPs and MAB-DCOPs. Our experiments emphasize two key traits of the algorithms. First, bounded approximate algorithms perform well in terms of our requirements. Second, optimal algorithms incur an increase in both the computation and communication load necessary to solve PO-DCOPs because they are trying to optimally solve a problem which is potentially more complex than canonical DCOPs",science,996,not included

This training process involves, among other things, scaling the input and output datasets provided to the neural network. The reason that the scaling process is required, is that real world problem datasets might not be in the range [0, 1], whereas the neural networks work with data only in the range [0, 1], i.e. the neurons fire or they do not. To achieve this, linear scaling is typically used, which for certain datasets can make it difficult for the neural network to properly differentiate between values that are close together. \ud
	This project will show how the implementation of non-linear median scaling can be applied to the training datasets and compares its performance against the linear scaling methodology for a variety of training datasets both for speed of learning and subsequent ability to generalize.

By using Multi Agent Simulation (MAS) techniques, among others, social scientists are able to explore âwhat if â scenarios of emergent behaviors in complex social systems. However, the Social Simulation method faces many challenges: a) human subjectivity; there is no computer, mathematical model nor software powerful and exhaustive enough to replicate subjective aspects like love, free will, etc; b) pervasive contingency; even if we can simulate the interaction of a great number of variables and environmental factors, a computational simulation will never attain the level of complexity that actual human social phenomena has and c) validation; is it not always easy to extract from the real world the kind of research results needed to validate social simulation models. In the other hand, Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) share many characteristics with MAS models. MMORPGs resemble in many ways the social complexities of the real world, they are also coded through a programming language and they are also based on a hardware/software platform â¦ but they feature one thing that MAS models donât: real human beings participate on them, instead of mere AI based agents. Therefore MMORPGs are quasi-simulations that offer unprecedented opportunities for studying complex social phenomena. Since it is humans and not only AI NPCs who play them, the âhuman subjectivity â problem can be bypassed. Their âsandbox â nature minimizes the âpervasive contingency â problem. Moreover, the wide arrange of data gathering possibilities they offer (see for example Ducheneaut et al, 2004, Williams et al 2008a) empower researchers to obtain appropriate results for computer model validation purposes. In this sense, Gee (2004) and Burke (2005) call for the need of bridging complex systems simulation techniques with MMORPGs studies, and in this paper I intend to further the discussion of the kind framework that is needed for such enterprise.

faces). In the current study we investigated the accuracy of recognition of
emotions expressed by comparable facial landmarks (compared to accuracy of
recognition of emotions expressed by full faces), but now used face-tracking
software to produce the facial landmarks. In line with earlier findings, results
suggested that participants could accurately identify emotions expressed by the

Then, &Epsilon; -SVR is used to predict real effort of software projects with the input data sets. Experiments on ISBSG (International Software Benchmarking Standard Group) and CSBSG (Chinese Software Benchmarking Standard Group) data sets demonstrate that, with the tasks of effort prediction, the treatment regarding missingness in software effort data set as unobserved values can produce more desirable performance than that of regarding missingness as absent features. This paper is the first to introduce the concept of absent features to deal with missingness of software effort data. &copy; 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company",science,1000,not included

Multinomial Inverse Regression (MIR) has wide applicability to a diverse array of problems. Further, the model is technologically impressive and the software is easy to apply to real problems. I hope that MIR will gain widespread use in the machine learning literature and across the social sciences. This comment will focus on a basic question that arises when applying MIR: how do we know that it is performing well? The daunting challenge is that when using MIR to discover characteristics of words, the usual evaluation methods are inappropriate. The standard eval-uation for methods like MIR is to assess its performance in out of sample prediction tasks. When this is the goalâas in supervised learning tasksâthen this is the ideal evaluation. And as the author shows, MIR excels at this task, with superior classification accuracy for the set of restaurant reviews. Text classification is certainly important, but perhaps the most promising application of MIR is to measuring how words convey sentiment. For example, the author uses MIR to identify differences in language between Democrats and Republicans (and differences in lan-guage based on constituency characteristics).

the rapid progress in machine learning during the past decade. We argue that a
hindrance is the high cost of experimentation on real systems, in terms of both
time and money. We address this problem by proposing an open-source robotic
platform which can safely operate without human supervision. The hardware is
inexpensive (about \SI{5000}[\$]{}) yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of
complex interaction with external objects. The software operates at 1-kilohertz
and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. The
easy-to-use front-end (in C++ and Python) is suitable for real-time control as
well as deep reinforcement learning. In addition, the software framework is
largely robot-agnostic and can hence be used independently of the hardware
proposed herein. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the proposed platform
through a number of experiments, including real-time optimal control, deep
reinforcement learning from scratch, throwing, and writing",robotics,1002,not included

As human survival chances are negatively correlated with detection time, the response time is a vital factor in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, thus potential delays may have dramatic and even lethal results. Moreover, the safety of rescue workers is another major issue and must be ensured in any circumstance. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology can provide a critical and multifaceted support in SAR missions. Given the fact that the faster these operations are planned and executed, the greater the chances of success they get, these aerial robots are ideal candidates for such applications owed to their ability of being nimble, quick-moving and easily programmed to exhibit autonomous behaviors. Hence, with the aim to increase the prospects of distressed people to remain alive, robotic rescue systemsâeither remote controlled or autonomous onesâmust be instantaneously available, to provide a robust helping hand to rescuers, thus boosting their performance and ensuring their own safety. The doctoral dissertation in hand deals with the study and implementation of a novel fully autonomous UAV-based rescue platform for life-saving services, by combining Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Specifically, the proposed Autonomous Aerial Rescue System (AARS), namely the ROLFER (RObotic Lifeguard For Emergency Rescue), is capable of precisely locating and providing instantaneous emergency services to humans in peril during critical events. The main systemâs components are: a completely autonomous rescue UAV and its bearing equipment, the Ground Control Station (GCS) including all the apparent software and hardware for the systemâs proper functionality, as well as the wearable equipment carried by humans in peril for the distress signal transmission. The rescue systemâs Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are to: (i) be fully autonomous, i.e. guided solely by data provided by the distressed humanâs wearable equipment without requiring to include human-in-the-loop, (ii) provide fast reaction as possible, i.e. to minimize the intervention time a UAV needs to provide invaluable assistance to a human in the context of an emergency and (iii) precisely detect the human in peril as well to accurately release the rescue equipment. The importance of not wasting the critical response time, as well as taking into serious consideration any other vital parameter during a SAR operation is obvious. The main objectives of this research are summarized as follows: The study, design and implementation of a fully autonomous aerial robotic system for the provision of life-saving services to humans in peril, The deployment of two human rescue scenarios in both maritime and terrestrial environments, The detection of human in peril using several accurate advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based localization methods, The detection, tracking and localization of human in peril using advanced image processing techniques as well as the precise rescue apparatus release, The hazard identification and risk analysis of the proposed AARS for the elimination of potential threats to both human in peril and rescue workers, by applying System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Thus, the structure of the dissertation in hand is mainly based on the aforementioned objectives. In particular, Chapter 1 introduces the utilization of robotic systems in SAR operations including some crucial information about UAVs, a review of the related literature, as well the contribution of this dissertation within the state of art. Chapter 2 presents the proposed aerial rescue support systemâs architecture and functionality, concerning details about both software and hardware configuration, as well as the systemâs performance evaluation in terms of both accuracy and intervention time. Moreover, Chapter 3 addresses the issue of precise localization of the distressed human by implementing advanced geolocalization techniques (e.g. Real Time Kinematics (RTK)-GPS). Thus, an enhanced positioning system which grounds on a specially customized wearable device is proposed, allowing the precise positioning of human in peril. Both hardware and software configuration of the designed novel prototype are described. Experimental results from real flight tests of the proposed AARS and the effectiveness of the implemented moving-base RTK-GPS-based wearable apparatus are also discussed in detail. Chapter 4 presents the vision-based punctual and precise detection of humans in peril from the proposed AARS. In particular, human detection is implemented based on two different approaches:a)by utilizing deep learning techniques on-board the autonomous systemâs rescue UAV for the human in peril in maritime environmentb)by combining RTK-GPS techniques and advanced image processing algorithms on the proposed rescue systemâs GCS for the human in peril in terrestrial environment. Two suitable datasets, including human in peril in both maritime and terrestrial environments have been created for the computer vision algorithms training. Hardware and software configuration, as well experimental results for the accurate human detection and rescue apparatus fall down are presented in detail.  In Chapter 5, a hazard identification and risk analysis of the proposed AARS, for the elimination of potential threats to both human in peril and rescue workers from the proposed system functionality is presented. The objectives of this analysis are a) to introduce the idea of analyzing the system by dividing it in separate operational modes and b) to feature the advantages of applying a systemic STPA-based safety approach on a SAR mission recruiting the use of UAVs. The dissertation is concluded in Chapter 6 where our findings are summarized and future work is mentioned.The doctoral dissertation in hand has been conducted in the Laboratory of Robotics and Automation of the Department of Production and Management of DUTh, which expertizes in such systems implementations.Î¤Î¿ Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±Î»ÏÏÎµÏÎ¿ ÏÏÏÎ²Î»Î·Î¼Î± ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¬ ÏÎ·Î½ Î´Î¹Î¬ÏÎºÎµÎ¹Î± ÎºÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¬ÏÎµÏÎ½ ÎµÎºÏÎ¬ÎºÏÎ¿Ï Î±Î½Î¬Î³ÎºÎ·Ï ÎµÎ¯Î½Î±Î¹ Î· Î¬Î¼ÎµÏÎ· Î±Î½ÏÎ¯Î´ÏÎ±ÏÎ· ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î· ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÎ® Î²Î¿Î·Î¸ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ½ ÏÏÏÏÎ·Ï Î±Î½Î¬Î³ÎºÎ·Ï ÏÏÎ± ÏÏÏ ÎºÎ¯Î½Î´ÏÎ½Î¿ Î¬ÏÎ¿Î¼Î±.

  autonomous robot software",http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03813,"It is important to be able to establish formal performance bounds for
autonomous systems. However, formal verification techniques require a model of
the environment in which the system operates; a challenge for autonomous
systems, especially those expected to operate over longer timescales. This
paper describes work in progress to automate the monitor and repair of
ROS-based autonomous robot software written for an a-priori partially known and
possibly incorrect environment model. A taint analysis method is used to
automatically extract the data-flow sequence from input topic to publish topic,
and instrument that code. A unique reinforcement learning approximation of MDP
utility is calculated, an empirical and non-invasive characterization of the
inherent objectives of the software designers. By comparing off-line (a-priori)
utility with on-line (deployed system) utility, we show, using a small but real
ROS example, that it's possible to monitor a performance criterion and relate
violations of the criterion to parts of the software. The software is then
patched using automated software repair techniques and evaluated against the
original off-line utility.Comment: IEEE Workshop on Assured IEEE Workshop on Assured Autonomous Systems,

framework for robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD). The latter refers to methodologies
that develop behavioral policies from example state-to-action mappings. To this
end, we study the reciprocal interaction of perception and action, in order to teach robots
a repertoire of novel action behaviors. Based on that, we design, develop and implement
a robust imitation framework, termed IMFO (IMitation Framework by Observation), that
facilitates imitation learning and relevant applications in human-robot interaction (HRI)
tasks. IMFO can cope with the reproduction of learned (i.e. previously observed) actions,
aswell as novel ones. Mapping of human actions to the respective robotic ones is achieved
via an indeterminate depiction, termed latent space representation. The latter accomplishes
a compact, yet precise abstraction of action trajectories, effectively representing
high dimensional raw actions in a low dimensional space.
Moreover, throughout this thesis, we examine the role of time in LfD by enhancing
the aforementioned framework with the notion of learning both the spatial and temporal
characteristics of human motions. Accordingly, learned actions can be subsequently reproduced
in the context of more complex time-informed HRI scenarios. Unlike previous
LfD methods that cope only with the spatial traits of an action, the formulated scheme
effectively encompasses spatial and temporal aspects. Extensive experimentation with a
variety of real robotic platforms demonstrates the robustness and applicability of the introduced
integrated LfD scheme.
Learned actions are reproduced under the high level control of a time-informed task
planner. During the implementation of the studied scenarios, temporal and physical constraints
may impose speed adaptations in the performed actions. The employed latent
space representation readily supports such variations, giving rise to novel actions in the
temporal domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
enhanced imitation scheme in the implementation of HRI scenarios. Additionally, a set
of well defined evaluation metrics are introduced to assess the validity of the proposed
approach considering the temporal and spatial consistency of the reproduced behaviors.
A noteworthy extension of the above regards force-based object grasping for executing
sensitive manipulation tasks. This is also treated in the current thesis via a novel supervised
learning scheme, termed SLF (Supervised Learning for Force-based manipulation).
SLF is formulated as a three-stage process: (a) supervised trial-execution in simulation
to acquire sufficient training data; (b) training to facilitate grasp learning with suitable
robot-arm pose and lifting force; (c) grasp execution in simulation. Subsequently, following
sim-to-real transfer, operation in real environments is achieved in addition to simulated
ones, generalizing also for objects not included in the trial sessions. The proposed
learning scheme is demonstrated in object lifting tasks where the applied force varies for
different objects with similar contact friction coefficients, and likewise the grasping pose.
Experimental results on the manipulator YuMi show that the robot is able to effectively
reproduce demanding lifting and manipulation tasks after learning is accomplished.
In summary, our thesis has studied LfD and has contributed with a novel approach that
introduced latent space representations to encode the action characteristics. A framework
implementation (IMFO) of our approach allowed extensive experimentation and also conduction
of HRI scenarios. The inclusion of temporal aspects in our approach enhanced it
to cope with complex, real-life interactions. Finally, the extension of IMFO with forcebased
grasping facilitated manipulation tasks with sensitive objects",robotics,1008,not included

An adequate selection of the team members and an effective coordination are some of the challenges to fully exploit the unique capabilities that these types of systems can offer. Motivated by real world applications, we focus on a multi-robotic network consisting off aerial and ground agents which has the potential to provide critical support to humans in complex settings. For instance, aerial robotic relays are capable of transporting small ground mobile sensors to expand the communication range and the situational awareness of first responders in hazardous environments.

In the first part of this dissertation, we extend work on manipulation of cable-suspended loads using aerial robots by solving the problem of lifting the cable-suspended load from the ground before proceeding to transport it. Since the suspended load-quadrotor system experiences switching conditions during this critical maneuver, we define a hybrid system and show that it is differentially-flat. This property facilitates the design of a nonlinear controller which tracks a waypoint-based trajectory associated with the discrete states of the hybrid system. In addition, we address the case of unknown payload mass by combining a least-squares estimation method with the designed controller.

Second, we focus on the coordination of a heterogeneous team formed by a group of ground mobile sensors and a flying communication router which is deployed to sense areas of interest in a cluttered environment. Using potential field methods, we propose a controller for the coordinated mobility of the team to guarantee inter-robot and obstacle collision avoidance as well as connectivity maintenance among the ground agents while the main goal of sensing is carried out. For the case of the aerial communications relays, we combine antenna diversity with reinforcement learning to dynamically re-locate these relays so that the received signal strength is maintained above a desired threshold.

Motivated by the recent interest of combining radio frequency and optical wireless communications, we envision the implementation of an optical link between micro-scale aerial and ground robots. This type of link requires maintaining a sufficient relative transmitter-receiver position for reliable communications. In the third part of this thesis, we tackle this problem. Based on the link model, we define a connectivity cone where a minimum transmission rate is guaranteed. For example, the aerial robot has to track the ground vehicle to stay inside this cone. The control must be robust to noisy measurements. Thus, we use particle filters to obtain a better estimation of the receiver position and we design a control algorithm for the flying robot to enhance the transmission rate. Also, we consider the problem of pairing a ground sensor with an aerial vehicle, both equipped with a hybrid radio-frequency/optical wireless communication system. A challenge is positioning the flying robot within optical range when the sensor location is unknown. Thus, we take advantage of the hybrid communication scheme by developing a control strategy that uses the radio signal to guide the aerial platform to the ground sensor. Once the optical-based signal strength has achieved a certain threshold, the robot hovers within optical range.

Finally, we investigate the problem of building an alliance of agents with different skills in order to satisfy the requirements imposed by a given task. We find this alliance, known also as a coalition, by using a bipartite graph in which edges represent the relation between agent capabilities and required resources for task execution. Using this graph, we build a coalition whose total capability resources can satisfy the task resource requirements. Also, we study the heterogeneity of the formed coalition to analyze how it is affected for instance by the amount of capability resources present in the agents.Electrical EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

Chess, poker, stock trading, real-time strategy games, robot soccer, robot rescue or planning, and autonomous vehicles are among the most well known. Adaptability, proactiveness, and interop-erability are essential characteristics of these games. Many of these competitions focus on development of rational behavior that would allow dominance over competitors. Apart from game play, though, one of the main reasons for these competi-tions is to bridge the gap between AI and real-life domains. In many real-life domains, such as trading environments, self-interested entities need to operate subject to limited time and information. Additionally, the web has mediated an ever broad-er range of transactions, urging participants to concurrently trade across multiple markets. All these have generated the need for technologies that empower prompt investigation of large vol-umes of data and rapid evaluation of numerous alternative strategies in the face of constantly changing market conditions (Bichler, Gupta, and Ketter 2010). AI and machine-learning tech-niques, including neural networks and genetic algorithms, are continuously gaining ground in the support of such trading sce-narios. User modeling, price forecasting, market equilibrium pre-diction, and strategy optimization are typical cases where AI typ-ically provides reliable solutions. Yet, the adoption and deployment of AI practices in real trading environments remains limited, since the proprietary nature of markets precludes open benchmarking, which is critical for further scientific progress.

Although at undergraduate levels the students are introduced to basic theoretical concepts and tools, at postgraduate courses more complex topics have to be covered. One of those advanced subjects is Cognitive Robotics, which covers aspects like automatic symbolic reasoning, decision-making, task planning or machine learning. In particular, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning and
decision-making methodology that does not require a model of the environment where the robot operates, overcoming this limitation by making observations. In order to get the greatest educational benefit, RL theory should be complemented with some hands-on RL task that uses a real robot, so students get a complete vision of the learning problem, as well as of the issues that arise when dealing with a physical robotic platform. There are several RL techniques that can be studied in such a subject; we have chosen Q-learning, since is a simple, effective and well-known RL algorithm.

In this paper we present a minimalist implementation of the Q-learning method for a Lego Mindstorms NXT mobile robot, focused on simplicity and applicability, and flexible enough to be adapted to several tasks. Starting from a simple wandering problem, we first design an off-line model of the learning process in which the Q-learning parameters are studied. After that, we implement the algorithm on the robot, gradually enlarging the number of states-actions of the problem. The final result of this work is a teaching framework for developing practical activities regarding Q-learning in our Robotics subjects, which will improve our teaching.Universidad de MÃ¡laga.

The usefulness of a software simulation is determined by the validity of the underlying model of the system. Software simulation often treats the real world in a less random and more predictable fashion than is the case in nature. The use of an actual physical controlled object creates a more realistic environment to carry out real-time or AI experiments. These physical objects exhibit a more chaotic behavior due to the mechanical issues independent of the controlling algorithm. The construction and use of robots to accomplish this behavior has been successfully done in the past. The research discussed in this paper established a semi-adversarial environment. In this type of an environment one of the parties neither hinders nor assists in the process undertaken. To demonstrate this behavior the most appropriate group of animals is a herd of sheep.

One of the main challenges in Artificial Intelligence is to bias the learning phase sufficiently in order to obviate complexity issues, while at the same time not restricting the agent to a certain environment or to a particular task. In this paper we describe a framework for autonomous design of experiments for a robotic agent, which enables the robot to improve and increase its conceptual knowledge about the environment through open-ended learning by experimentation. We specify our implementation of this framework and describe how its modules can recognize situations in which learning is useful or necessary, gather target-oriented data and provide it to machine learning algorithms, thus reducing the search space

In most cases of embodied and situated agents, the learning goal for the artificial agent is to âmapâ or classify the environment and the objects therein [1, 2], in order to improve navigation or the execution of some other domain-specific task. Dynamic environments and changing tasks still pose a major challenge for robotic learning in real-world domains. In order to intelligently adapt its task strategies, the agent needs cognitive abilities to more deeply understand its environment and the effects of its actions. In order to approach this challenge within an open-ended learning loop, the XPERO project (http://www.xpero.org) explores the paradigm of Learning by Experimentation to increase the robot's conceptual world knowledge autonomously. In this setting, tasks which are selected by an actionselection mechanism are interrupted by a learning loop in those cases where the robot identifies learning as necessary for solving a task or for explaining observations. It is important to note that our approach targets unsupervised learning, since there is no oracle available to the agent, nor does it have access to a reward function providing direct feedback on the quality of its learned model, as e.g. in reinforcement learning approaches. In the following sections we present our framework for integrating autonomous robotic experimentation into such a learning loop. In section 1 we explain the different modules for stimulation and design of experiments and their interaction.

Two diverse opinions have emerged in the previous discussion. One, due to McCarthy, asserts that emotions will introduce obstacles in the communication among robots and human beings [6]. On the other hand, Minsky sustains the opinion that it is impossible to implement intelligence without emotions [7].

Some of the specific artificial intelligence algorithms that were developed for monitoring and diagnosis included the use of heuristic and causal model-based reasoning techniques for predictive generation of sensor values, sensor selection planning, dynamic alarm limit checking, hierarchical procedure specialists for fault diagnosis, and integration of Al with conventional systems in full-scale monitoring and diagnosis applications.  In support of this overall program of research, novel software engineering tools for artificial intelligence research and application development were also developed and will be discussed in the thesis.  The application of artificial intelligence techniques to the monitoring and diagnosis of robotic space systems was shown to be very effective with specific benefits in the areas of systems autonomy, spacecraft safety, ground operations productivity and automation. As a result of this work in part, artificial intelligence is now considered by senior mission designers to be an enabling technology for on-board automation of planetary rovers and for automation in mission operations at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory",robotics,1035,included

Under the name ""Smart Factory"", the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) aims to send data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems for which cloud computing has proven to be an important tool to meet processing needs. unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being introduced as part of IIoT and can perform important tasks. UAVs are now considered one of the best remote sensing techniques for collecting data over large areas. In the field of fog and edge computing, the IoT gateway connects various objects and sensors to the Internet. It function as a common interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. Edge intelligence is expected to replace Deep Learning (DL) computing in the cloud, providing a variety of distributed, low-latency and reliable intelligent services. In this paper, An unmanned aerial vehicle is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform. Rather than sending photos from the UAV to the cloud for processing, an AI cloud trained model is deployed in the IoT gateway and used to process the taken photos. This model is designed to overcome the latency channels of the cloud computing architecture. The results show that the monitoring and tracking process using advanced computing in the IoT gateway is significantly faster than in the cloud.",autonomous vehicle,1038,included

With the growing applications of such vehicles, testing of autonomous flight is a very important task for rapid deployment. There are different tools for modeling and simulating unmanned vehicles in virtual worlds such as Gazebo, MATLAB, Simulink, and Webots to name a few. None of these simulation tools are able to model all possible physical parameters of a real-world environment. Hence, the flight controller or mission planning software has to be tested in the physical world in the presence of an expert before deployment for a specific task. A Perception Inference Engine evaluation tool is presented that can infer internal states of the autonomous system from external observations only. The Gazebo simulation platform is used to collect data to develop the perception model. For real-time data collection, a VICON motion capture system is used to observe the autonomous flight of a small unmanned aerial vehicle. A state-of-the-art decision tree algorithm is used to implement the data-driven approach. The technique was tested using simulation data and verified with real-time data from Intel Aero Ready to Fly and Parrot AR. 2.0 drones. Moreover, we analyzed the robustness of the proposed system by introducing noise in sensor measurement and ambiguity in the testing scenario. We compared the performance of the decision tree classifier with NaÃ¯ve bayes and support vector machine classifiers. It is shown that the developed system can be used for the performance evaluation of a UAV operating in the physical world by significantly reducing uncertainty in mission failure due to environmental parameters.",autonomous vehicle,1039,not included

Since a long transition period might be required to fully automate such facilities, we have to deploy AMRs while improving safety in the mixed environments of human and mobile robots. In addition, human behaviors in such environments might be difficult to predict. In this paper, we present a Digital Twin for Autonomous Mobile Robots system named DigiMobot to support, manage, monitor, and validate AMRs in indoor environments. First, DigiMobot can simulate human behaviors and robot movements to verify and validate AMRs to improve safety in a virtual world. Secondly, DigiMobot can monitor and manage AMRs in the physical world by collecting sensor data from each robot in real-time. Since DigiMobot enables us to test the robot systems in the virtual world, we can deploy and implement AMRs in each facility without any modifications. To show the feasibility of DigiMobot, we develop a software framework and two different types of autonomous mobile robots. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments in a warehouse located in Saitama, Japan, in which more than 400, 000 items are stored for commercial purposes.",autonomous vehicle,1040,included

Even though IoT notion has gained much attention during the last few decades, real-world implementation of large-scale IoT network is still evolving in its infancy. Since deployment lags far behind the theoretic notion, comprehensive research efforts on innovative applications, architecture, and a network of IoT are required to promote the implementation of large-scale, high-quality, efficient, and secure IoT scenarios. Software Defined Networks (SDN) facilitates a variety of opportunities for network evolution. The key feature of SDN is to decouple data and control planes, which removes control plane from network hardware. As a result, it offers a remarkable resilience in programming, while providing a broad range of opportunities to optimize the utilization of network resources. Owing to the characteristics of SDN, experts in both industry and academia claims SDN as one of the ideal technologies to bridge the gaps and to overcome drawbacks of IoT deployment. Exploiting the benefits of scalable and adaptable network devices, SDN is considered as highly promising in empowering smart, powerful, and open IoT services and communication functionalities.
