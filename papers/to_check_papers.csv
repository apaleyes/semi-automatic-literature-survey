However, deep learning methods have shown great promise in not only providing excellent performance for complex and non-linear control problems, but also in generalising previously learned rules to new scenarios. For these reasons, the use of deep learning for vehicle control is becoming increasingly popular. Although important advancements have been achieved in this field, these works have not been fully summarised. This paper surveys a wide range of research works reported in the literature which aim to control a vehicle through deep learning methods. Although there exists overlap between control and perception, the focus of this paper is on vehicle control, rather than the wider perception problem which includes tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. The paper identifies the strengths and limitations of available deep learning methods through comparative analysis and discusses the research challenges in terms of computation, architecture selection, goal specification, generalisation, verification and validation, as well as safety. Overall, this survey brings timely and topical information to a rapidly evolving field relevant to intelligent transportation systems.",autonomous vehicle

In this paper, a novel framework that leverages machine learning techniques for utilizing Signals of Opportunity (SoO) for robust localization of all vehicles operating along a stretch of roadway is presented. By making use of ubiquitous wireless emissions from vehicles, the presented approach performs vehicle localization without any active participation/assistance from vehicles thus making it a suitable candidate for SA in mixed traffic environments. Our simulation results show that given the road shape and number of vehicles present, observed 2D localization estimates generated by an arbitrary algorithm whose error is described by a Gaussian bivariate distribution with 10 meters covariance yields unbiased vehicle centroid estimates with less than one meter mean squared error by eight Kalman Filter (KF) iterations. A set of KFs for each vehicle are used to leverage the filtering of multiple estimates per vehicle per filter step to reduce measurement noise by averaging, while a clustering algorithm performs the dual role of forming KF set priors and classifying location estimates to their correct vehicle.",autonomous vehicle

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) play the principal role in learning high level feature representations from visual inputs. It is crucial to know how reliable those neural networks are as human lives can be at stake. Recent experiments on the robustness of CNNs show that they are highly susceptible to small adversarial perturbations. Due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices, there is a significant demand for CNN models which are smaller enough to run on a mobile device without sacrificing the accuracy. Although recent researches have been successful at achieving smaller models with comparable accuracy on standard image datasets, their robustness to adversarial attacks has not been studied. However, massive deployment of smaller models on millions of mobile devices stresses importance of their robustness. In this work, we study how robust such models are with respect to state-of-the-art compression techniques such as quantization. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) insights to achieve smaller and robust models (2) a compression framework which is adversarial-aware. Our findings reveal that compressed models are naturally more robust than compact models. This provides an incentive to perform compression rather than designing compact models. Additionally, the latter provides benefits of increased accuracy and higher compression rate, up to 90×.",autonomous vehicle

The literature is abundant with deep learning networks that detect either lights or signs, not both, which makes them unsuitable for real-life deployment due to the limited graphics processing unit (GPU) memory and power available on embedded systems.

We present a deep hierarchical architecture in conjunction with a mini-batch proposal selection mechanism that allows a network to detect both traffic lights and signs from training on separate traffic light and sign datasets. Our method solves the overlapping issue where instances from one dataset are not labelled in the other dataset. We are the first to present a network that performs joint detection on traffic lights and signs. We measure our network on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K benchmark for traffic sign detection and the Bosch Small Traffic Lights benchmark for traffic light detection and show it outperforms the existing Bosch Small Traffic light state-of-the-art method.

In such networks, UAVs act as base stations and provide downloading service to users. Compared with conventional terrestrial base stations, such UAV-BSs can dynamically adjust their locations to improve network performance. However, there exists two important issues in UAV networks, handoff overhead and UAV deployment. The handoff overhead issue is particularly important for UAVs because UAV BSs are connected to cellular BSs via wireless backhaul links, which are costly in terms of spectrum usage and energy consumption. Hence, it is highly desirable to eliminate any unnecessary handoff to minimise the waste of wireless backhaul. The UAV deployment, on the other hand, introduces a new tool for radio resource management, since BS positions are open for network optimisation. In this paper, a smart user association algorithm, named reinforcement learning handoff (RLH), is devised to reduce redundant handoffs in UAV networks and two methods of UAV mobility control are designed to co-operate with the proposed RLH algorithm to optimise the system throughput. In the RLH algorithm, users perform handoffs according to the reward of a reinforcement learning process.

To optimally process assigned tasks, each UAV requires prompt and ubiquitous information provisioning regarding the varying operation conditions, which renders exploiting base stations (BSs) of existing wireless infrastructures a tractable solution. To receive services from a BS, a UAV should stay within the coverage area of a BS, which however limits the operation range of a UAV. This obstacle thus drives the deployment of a special sort of UAV, known as an aerial base station (ABS), to relay signals between a BS and a UAV. Based on different flight paths of UAVs, an ABS should autonomously decide its own flight trajectory so as to maximize the number of UAVs which can receive wireless services. However, the inherently non-stationary environment renders the optimum autonomous deployment of an ABS a challenging issue. Inspired by the merit of interacting with the environment, we consequently propose a reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the flight trajectory of an ABS.

UAV swarms when each UAV carries a machine learning classification task. To
avoid data exchange with ground-based processing nodes, a federated learning
approach is adopted between a UAV leader and the swarm members to improve the
local learning model while avoiding excessive air-to-ground and ground-to-air

sophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many

problem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent
from the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
guides the agent's actions. The ""value alignment problem"" is to specify a goal
structure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief

However, assessing how XAI techniques can help understand models beyond classification tasks, e.g. for reinforcement learning (RL), has not been extensively studied. We review recent works in the direction to attain Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), a relatively new subfield of Explainable Artificial Intelligence, intended to be used in general public applications, with diverse audiences, requiring ethical, responsible and trustable algorithms. In critical situations where it is essential to justify and explain the agent’s behaviour, better explainability and interpretability of RL models could help gain scientific insight on the inner workings of what is still considered a black box. We evaluate mainly studies directly linking explainability to RL, and split these into two categories according to the way the explanations are generated: transparent algorithms and post-hoc explainability. We also review the most prominent XAI works from the lenses of how they could potentially enlighten the further deployment of the latest advances in RL, in the demanding present and future of everyday problems.

                  The granularization of crucial network functions implementation using software-centric, and virtualized approaches in 5G networks have brought forth unprecedented security challenges in general and privacy concerns. Moreover, these software components’ premature deployment and compromised supply chain put the individual network components at risk and have a ripple effect for the rest of the network. Some of the novel threats to 5G assets include tampering in identity and access management, supply-chain poisoning, masquerade and bot attacks, loop-holes in source codes. Machine learning (ML) in this context can help to provide heavily dynamic and robust security mechanisms for the software-centric architecture of 5G Networks. ML models’ development and implementation also rely on programmable environments; hence, they can play a vital role in designing, modelling, and automating efficient security protocols. This article presents the threat landscape across 5G networks and discusses the feasibility and architecture of different ML-based models to counter these threats. Also, we present the architecture for automated threat intelligence using cooperative and coordinated ML to secure 5G assets and infrastructure.

In this paper, a novel neural network architecture inspired by the immune algorithm is presented and used in the forecasting of naturally occurring signals, including weather big data signals. Big Data Analysis is a major research frontier, which attracts extensive attention from academia, industry and government, particularly in the context of handling issues related to complex dynamics due to changing weather conditions. Recently, extensive deployment of IoT, sensors, and ambient intelligence systems led to an exponential growth of data in the climate domain. In this study, we concentrate on the analysis of big weather data by using the Dynamic Self Organized Neural Network Inspired by the Immune Algorithm. The learning strategy of the network focuses on the local properties of the signal using a self-organised hidden layer inspired by the immune algorithm, while the recurrent links of the network aim at recalling previously observed signal patterns. The proposed network exhibits improved performance when compared to the feedforward multilayer neural network and state-of-the-art recurrent networks, e.g., the Elman and the Jordan networks. Three non-linear and non-stationary weather signals are used in our experiments. Firstly, the signals are transformed into stationary, followed by 5-steps ahead prediction. Improvements in the prediction results are observed with respect to the mean value of the error (RMS) and the signal to noise ratio (SNR), however to the expense of additional computational complexity, due to presence of recurrent links.

                  Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.

Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition to interacting with the environment, can also communicate with each other over a noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment, and the message each agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate “effectively” over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message reliably over a noisy channel, and the “learning to communicate” framework that has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP.

All schemes are designed efficiently to run on parallel platforms to reduce the computation time and enhance the scalability.

controlled directly in a physical (closed-course proving ground) or virtual

spontaneously during operation in the real world (open-road testing or

  In AV testing, simulation serves primarily two purposes: to assist the

address such sudden flow breakdowns. When queuing is imminent, Speed
Harmonization (SH), which adjusts speeds in upstream traffic to mitigate

driver awareness and compliance, it may not always be effective in mitigating
congestion. The use of multiagent reinforcement learning for collaborative
learning, is a promising solution to this challenge. By incorporating this
technique in the control algorithms of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV),
it may be possible to train the CAVs to make joint decisions that can mitigate
highway bottleneck congestion without human driver compliance to altered speed

operate in mixed traffic (both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs)). The
results suggest that even at CAV percent share of corridor traffic as low as

exposing the model to a wide range of scenarios so that it can generalize to

a model trained with randomization tends to run slower; a higher completion
rate on the testing track comes at the expense of longer lap times. This paper
aims to boost the robustness of a trained race car model without compromising
racing lap times. For a training track and a testing track having the same

communications, put forth by Shannon and Weaver in their seminal work [2], by
considering multiple agents communicating over a noisy channel in order to
achieve better coordination and cooperation in a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition
to interacting with the environment can also communicate with each other over a
noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered
explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment and the message each
agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the
agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate
""effectively"" over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the
traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message
reliably over a noisy channel, and the ""learning to communicate"" framework that
has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying
communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that
the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where
the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP. This
is a very powerful framework, which has many real world applications, from

these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance

One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.

autonomous driving testing: understanding and exploiting both digital and
physical adversarial perturbation generation for impacting steering decisions.
In this paper, we present DeepBillboard, a systematic physical-world testing
approach targeting at a common and practical driving scenario: drive-by
billboards. DeepBillboard is capable of generating a robust and resilient
printable adversarial billboard, which works under dynamic changing driving
conditions including viewing angle, distance, and lighting. The objective is to
maximize the possibility, degree, and duration of the steering-angle errors of
an autonomous vehicle driving by the generated adversarial billboard. We have
extensively evaluated the efficacy and robustness of DeepBillboard through
conducting both digital and physical-world experiments. Results show that
DeepBillboard is effective for various steering models and scenes. Furthermore,
DeepBillboard is sufficiently robust and resilient for generating
physical-world adversarial billboard tests for real-world driving under various
weather conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating the possibility of generating realistic and continuous
physical-world tests for practical autonomous driving systems.",autonomous vehicle
