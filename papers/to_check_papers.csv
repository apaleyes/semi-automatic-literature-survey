It has the potential to improve the theory and the practice of modelling, designing and implementing complex computer systems. Yet, to date, there has been little systematic analysis of what makes the agent-based approach such an appealing and powerful computational model. To rectify this situation, this paper aims to tackle exactly this issue. The standpoint of this analysis is the role of agent-based software in solving complex, realworld problems. In particular, it will be argued that the development of robust and scalable software systems requires autonomous agents that can complete their objectives while situated in a dynamic and uncertain environment, that can engage in rich, high-level interactions, and that can operate within flexible organisational structures.",science,1,not included

The present research has collected characteristics of gestures and physical movements from users made by other related research in order to study the same interaction within a virtual world. Through this research a smaller number of gestures were created improving the user learning curve without affecting the usability. The following implementation uses a client-server architecture composed of 2 Raspberry Pi devices and a Smartphone acting as a server the communication between them was achieved by employing Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The immersive virtual experience is accomplished by using Unity 3D and Google VR tools that allowed the design and display of a playful virtual environment as an approach to promote physical and cognitive skills such as spatial thinking and hand-eye coordination. By performing maneuvers through an aerial circuit filled with obstacles the proposed UAV simulator encourages motor and mental activity while the user is being entertained. The result is the improvement of the user quality of life by avoiding cognitive and physical sedentarism.,autonomous vehicle,2,not included

All these systems are paving the way for the forthcoming autonomous vehicle which will become a reality in the near future. Existing systems are based on numerous electronic systems with advanced skills, high performances, and high degrees of adaptability and intelligence. As is to be expected, these cutting-edge features require, in most cases, the use of powerful computing platforms. However, the deployment of such platforms is not an easy task, since they have to be integrated in the vehicle where there exist important restrictions regarding size, power consumption and cost. In this sense, every smart proposal aimed at reducing the complexity of these systems without degrading performance, is always a valuable contribution in the field. In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce the dimensionality of a driver distraction recognition system. The methodology is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm that looks for the minimum set of useful features collected during the driving task and also for the simplest recognition system. The recognition algorithm is an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) whose simplicity and fast learning procedure make it especially suitable to be used by a Genetic Algorithm which needs to evaluate thousands of candidate solutions. The proposed methodology has been tested with a real-world database collected from different drivers performing an itinerary with an instrumented car. The results obtained validate the proposal as a method to reduce the complexity of a driver distraction recognition system.",autonomous vehicle,4,not included

One of these aspects is the lack of a sufficient safety-performance-verification technique. The existing tools of functional-safety engineering do not provide a comprehensive solution for the verification of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For the verification of this type of algorithms, it has become widely accepted in the recent years that simulation tests should be used. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no detailed method for how these simulation tests should be performed has yet been suggested. To start tackling this gap, this paper presents a verification methodology based on the statistical testing of AVs’ safety-related functionality in simulated scenarios. Also, presented here is a test-case implementation of the methodology on a full-scale autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). In this example, the functionality of safe autonomous off-road navigation is verified. It is shown that the statistical performance data that are gathered using simulation can be used to accurately predict the overall safety performance of UGVs in real life. Our intention is that this paper will provide a starting point for the further discussion on the exact way simulation tests shall be used for the safety verification of AVs.",autonomous vehicle,6,not included

This study sought to utilize the data collected from virtual reality (VR)-based software and a leap-motion device used for learning in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases to enable early detection of MCI by analyzing the classification rules for errors (action slips) based on finger-action transitions when performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Finger motion was recorded as a time-series database. An induction technique known as Inductive-Logic Programming (ILP), which uses logical and clausal language to represent the training data, was then used to discover a concise classification rule using logical programming.

                  Patient-specific simulated rehearsal (PsR) is a technological advance within the domain of endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation. It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.
               
                  Methods
                  Medical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.
               
                  Results
                  Twenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p
                     =0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p
                     =0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p

                     =0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p
                     =0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p
                     =0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p
                     =0.49) and NOTSS (p
                     >0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Part- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention.

AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms.

We wake up in the morning, check our e-mail, make a quick phone call, commute to work, buy lunch. Many of these transactions leave digital breadcrumbs--tiny records of our daily experiences. Reality mining, which pulls together these crumbs using statistical analysis and machine learning methods, offers an increasingly comprehensive picture of our lives, both individually and collectively, with the potential of transforming our understanding of ourselves, our organizations, and our society in a fashion that was barely conceivable just a few years ago. It is for this reason that reality mining was recently identified by Technology Review as one of ""10 emerging technologies that could change the world"". Many everyday devices provide the raw database upon which reality mining builds; sensors in mobile phones, cars, security cameras, RFID ('smart card') readers, and others, all allow for the measurement of human physical and social activity. Computational models based on such data have the potential to dramatically transform the arenas of both individual and community health. Reality mining can provide new opportunities with respect to diagnosis, patient and treatment monitoring, health services planning, surveillance of disease and risk factors, and public health investigation and disease control. Currently, the single most important source of reality mining data is the ubiquitous mobile phone. Every time a person uses a mobile phone, a few bits of information are left behind. The phone pings the nearest mobile-phone towers, revealing its location. The mobile phone service provider records the duration of the call and the number dialed. In the near future, mobile phones and other technologies will collect even more information about their users, recording everything from their physical activity to their conversational cadences. While such data pose a potential threat to individual privacy, they also offer great potential value both to individuals and communities. With the aid of data-mining algorithms, these data could shed light on individual patterns of behavior and even on the well-being of communities, creating new ways to improve public health and medicine. To illustrate, consider two examples of how reality mining may benefit individual health care. By taking advantage of special sensors in mobile phones, such as the microphone or the accelerometers built into newer devices such as Apple's iPhone, important diagnostic data can be captured. Clinical pilot data demonstrate that it may be possible to diagnose depression from the way a person talks--a depressed person tends to speak more slowly, a change that speech analysis software on a phone might recognize more readily than friends or family do. Similarly, monitoring a phone's motion sensors can also reveal small changes in gait, which could be an early indicator of ailments such as Parkinson's disease. Within the next few years reality mining will become more common, thanks in part to the proliferation and increasing sophistication of mobile phones. Many handheld devices now have the processing power of low-end desktop computers, and they can also collect more varied data, due to components such as GPS chips that track location. The Chief Technology Officer of EMC, a large digital storage company, estimates that this sort of personal sensor data will balloon from 10% of all stored information to 90% within the next decade. While the promise of reality mining is great, the idea of collecting so much personal information naturally raises many questions about privacy. It is crucial that behavior-logging technology not be forced on anyone. But legal statutes are lagging behind data collection capabilities, making it particularly important to begin discussing how the technology will and should be used. Therefore, an additional focus of this chapter will be the development of a legal and ethical framework concerning the data used by reality mining techniques.",health,17,not included

Transforming such intentions and interests to reality involves software development and deployment, which has its own story of significant evolution. There has been a notable shift in the strategies and approaches to software development. Today, the divergence of tools and technologies as per demand is so substantial that adapting a software application from one environment to another could involve tedious redesign and redevelopment. This implies enormous effort in migrating existing applications and research works to a modern industrial setup. Additionally, the struggles with sustainability maintenance of such applications could be painful. Concerning ML/AI, the capabilities to train, deploy, retrain, and re-deploy AI models as quickly as possible will be crucial for AI-driven network systems. An end-to-end workflow using unified open-source frameworks is the need of the hour to facilitate the integration of ML/AI models into the modern software-driven virtualized communication networks. Hence, in our paper, we present such a prototype by demonstrating the journey of a sample SVM classifier from being a python script to be deployed as a micro-service using ONAP and Acumos.

This paper discusses the status and anticipated impact of supercomputers on finite-element analysis which is the primary tool for structural analysis and is also very useful in other areas of engineering analysis. The initial impact has been the significant reduction in turnaround time for large problems and the corresponding opportunity to solve heretofore unsolvable problems. In these cases, emphasis has been placed on employing already-proven computing software which was modifed to take advantage of vector processing and other forms of parallel operations. This trend is expected to continue because the established usage base of commercially available programs is not likely to be quickly dislodged. The near term will see the further use of design optimization, broader use of nonlinear mechanics, and a closer link between designers and analysts because of improved computer turnaround. The economy of scale suggests that solution techniques will be performed not only faster but cheaper than is possible with scalar processors which will further encourage the analysis of larger, more complex structures. The supercomputers of the future are expected to offer additional challenges to today's application systems. A primary factor in this will be the effective use of multiprocessors. Additional influence is expected as Artificial Intelligence matures to the point where Expert Systems become a reality for selected engineering and scientific disciplines. In order to effectively compete, today's software companies must address the possibility of significant changes in the architecture and methodology currently embodied in today's systems. Improved packaging, most likely in the form of pre- and postprocessors, will be necessary to provide industry- or technology-specific systems solutions.",industry,19,not included

Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the lack of a simple and effective solution for the generation of data sets usable to train a data-driven model, such as a modern deep neural network, so as to make them accessible in an industrial environment. Specifically, a deep learning robot guidance vision system would require such a large amount of manually labeled images that it would be too expensive and impractical for a real use case, where system reconfigurability is a fundamental requirement. With our system, on the other hand, especially in the field of industrial robotics, the cost of image labeling can be reduced, for the first time, to nearly zero, thus paving the way for self-reconfiguring systems with very high performance (as demonstrated by our experimental results). One of the limitations of this approach is the need to use a manual method for the detection of objects of interest in the preliminary stages of the pipeline (ARP or graphical interface). A feasible extension, related to the field of collaborative robotics, could be used to exploit the robot itself, manually moved by the user, even for this preliminary stage, so as to eliminate any source of inaccuracy.",industry,21,not included

Concept of Automated Vehicle in the era of the fourth industrial revolution is transforming from the `vehicle` that had its focal point in the hardware to the `portable computer` that has its focus in the software that processes broad range of digital information. The phenomenon in one aspect is innovation through scientific technology. However on the other hand, it is raising humanistic, philosophical and legal questions about how human life will change according to the technological and industrial transition. Age of `Artificial Intelligence` and `Posthuman` emerging through the development of technology is creating new concept of human and bringing forward the issue of new danger that is occurring when reason and physical abilities thought as the essence of `human` is being substituted by scientific technology and computer. The advocates of automated vehicle assert that it provides more safety and convenience to human. Such argument cannot be completely be false, and I wish to reach the same conclusion eventually. However, as other process of introducing new technology like nuclear energy tell us, to consider whether automated vehicle is more convenient and better than the previous vehicle system and whether there are no new danger that new technology is bringing about or overlooked elements of danger is severely important. Therefore, if certain danger is expected, technological prevention should be devised as a first step, and for the sections where technology and industry is not self-regulating, it is legislations and policies` role to lead and force to a human-friendly direction. Automated vehicle that is being discussed nowadays can be neutral itself and seem to be no more than a convenient device. However, since each automated vehicle is activated by entering massive amount of digital information and since it collects, stores, and distributes a welter of personal information when connected to Internet of Things(IoT), whole new danger from the previous era is created in terms of personal information and privacy. The ironic reality of surveillance society since the modern times that has assured freedom of an individual on the one hand and has reinforced utilitarian society control on the grounds of fully protecting one`s right and expanding welfare on the other lies beneath this near future. Especially, personal information is more being exposed and distributed and collection and surveillance of digital information is becoming easier in the information age. Automated vehicle system cannot be free from such exposure and danger of violating since it is operated with geolocation, video, and communication information as well. Moreover, since violation of personal information can lead to violation of privacy and human dignity, and damage the basic order of liberal democracy, arranging the frame of public regulation relating to personal information protection by researching U.S. and European Union legislation and seems more than necessary. Being awake is what sovereign needs in the digital era. Likewise, to secure right to personal information, we should remember to turn the monitoring lamp on in advance not only as an individual, but also as a group in order to obtain convenience and prevent danger of new era of automated vehicle.??? ????????? ??????????????? ?????????????????????????????? ???????????????(HY-2014??????)",industry,29,not included
10.1186/gb4141,to_check,project-academic,BioMed Central,26/11/2013 00:00,project-academic,rumors of the death of consumer genomics are greatly exaggerated,project-academic," The idea of computation is not new. Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century had already outlined its basic elements in a formal sense [1], though one could argue that various mechanical calculating devices in Classical Antiquity and in Imperial China prefigured the difference engines of later ages [2]. By the mid-20th century science fiction writers were imagining a few, perhaps even only one, mega computer driving human civilization into the future [3]. Obviously they were wrong. In the first decades of the 21st century computation has proliferated and dispersed; becoming ubiquitous, seamless, almost beneath notice. Rather than exciting exotica, computation is the banal undergirding of modern post-industrial civilization. Devices that in the past would be properly labeled powerful computers are today termed ‘phones’ , ‘cars’ or ‘espresso machines’. We have transitioned from an abstraction of rarified reflection to a plethora of devices geared toward unthinking consumption.

This is the trajectory one might project for what we now term direct to consumer (DTC) or beyond the clinic genomics [4], the ancestor of what is likely to become a ubiquitous form of information technology in the coming decades. If Gregor Mendel was the Leibniz of genomics, we are in the Apple I era, as hobbyists jockey with firms that harbor dreams of massive market share. There is no telling who will be the Microsoft or Apple of this industry, but that is partly because we do not have the equivalent of the VisiCalc yet. The Apple II has not arrived, let alone the Macintosh.

While the sequencing hardware behind the technological revolution is transitioning from the analog of corporate mainframes to desktop-ready devices, the productivity suites of consumer genomics have yet to be fully conceived, let alone implemented. So what applications will drive the industry in the next few years? Front and center in terms of candidates for the next ‘killer app’ is the relatively mature market for genetic genealogy. More broadly, genealogy is a maturing sector with billions in revenue and nearly 100 million serious enthusiasts [5]. Rather than creating a demand de novo, genetic genealogy serves to extend the reach and power of those with deep questions as to their ancestry. The appeal of this sector is unsurprising. Cultures as distinctive and varied as the Jews and Chinese are preoccupied with issues of descent. One could argue that a genealogical mindset is a human universal playing to our inner desire to understand ourselves, our origins and our purpose. The tools of modern genomics add depth and insight to answers that most humans crave in their bones. Inclusive of the older genomic techniques, such as microsatellite markers, consumers of genetic genealogy likely number into the millions, with the richer offerings of firms such as Family Tree DNA and 23andMe approaching the order of one million customers next year [6].

We are all products of a past that is sketched out in the broadest sense by phylogenetics. Our pedigrees expand rapidly and then coalesce back together again, as the same individuals show up over and over. This is what evolutionary genomics is telling us [7], but our basic human intuitions often fail to grasp the multigenerational story, which goes beyond great-grandparents, and into the deepest mists of our species’ past. DTC genomics in the domain of genetic genealogy can bridge the chasm between the abstruse inferences of population and phylogenetics, and the lived and familiar reality of human familial warmth. But it can only do so by reducing abstract scientific theory into a more human shape, relatable, palatable and compelling. It is trite to assert that ‘we are all one big family’, but what genomics can do is make this truth concrete, and add some scientific heft behind sentiment. The industry needs to refine and perfect the middle layer between the science and the consumer, to the point where the technical guts of the operating system become as encapsulated, mysterious and ubiquitous as the magic of an iPhone.

As analysis of ancestry and genealogy saturate over the next decade, it seems likely that a natural segue will be made to medical genomics, as massive sample sizes can finally be leveraged into fine-grained prediction. Genetic genealogy is an applied enterprise of phylogenetics, but adding phenotypic information to the rich implicit pedigrees may finally allow for both true and surprising outcomes in regards to health risk prediction and the general interpretation of genome variants. Eventually the personal information ecology in which we are embedded will be rich, tagged and amenable to being synthesized and reduced down to actionable units. Genetic genealogy complements written records, but its power is such that it can yield information as a standalone tool. Not so when it comes to medical and assorted trait predictions. Most genetic traits of interest are complex, with multiple, sometimes obscure, lines of causality. Modern studies that use hundreds of individuals are notoriously underpowered, and are rapidly being superseded by pooled data sets of hundreds of thousands. Yet this is nothing compared to what will no doubt be the norm in the next decade, as diverse strands of information continuously thread together, and generate a perpetual stream of novel insightful predictions. Imagine that biomarkers are constantly recording your feedback to a particular diet or activity, and this information is intersected with millions with varying levels of genetic relatedness and lifestyle. The computational requirements are immense, but the past few decades have shown us that we can always be surprised how far Moore’s Law can take us.

Of course such a scenario above begs the question whether people would be comfortable in a semipermeable soup of information floating in the future cloud. But fortunately, or unfortunately, some of the most powerful and innovative firms today are making Scott McNealy’s prediction of a post-privacy future come alive. In the simplest of terms, expectation of privacy evolves with technology. In particular, both Google and Facebook are pushing the public toward the direction of transparency in terms of personal data. For obvious reasons there is sensitivity in regards to medical information in the United States, but with universal coverage some of the concerns are likely to be obviated, while the body politic will also have an incentive to allow for greater information exchange to be leveraged into informing citizens as to the optimal path for a healthier lifestyle [8].

Like the thin edge of the wedge, DTC genomics over the next decade will be defined by first movers who are passionate. Some will be enthusiasts for genealogy, others for experimental bio-hacking, and many for self-improvement through total self-knowledge. These hobbyists will drive a market segment that caters to their needs by transforming the digital information in their genomes into actionable representations and projections. But once the DTC genomics industry matures it will likely be swallowed in toto by the emerging total information ecology. This is not just likely, but inevitable, because though your genes do not determine who you are, you cannot understand who you are without your genes. It may be tired to declare that the ‘information must be free’, but in a deep and fundamental sense emergence of ‘big data’ and personalization are validating that prediction. And yet just because information flows freely does not imply that it cannot be monetized; both Google and Facebook illustrate that. In the next decade one will see firms that make these companies seem like niche players, as they develop and deploy information utilities that are going to be similar to helper artificial intelligence. This is a future where basic day-to-day decisions will be offloaded to these automated systems, which will receive as inputs both environmental and hereditary variables. Where does that leave humans? Our lot will be to enjoy the good life, reflecting upon the deeper and more important things that are not so reducible by data analysis engines. In contrast to the idea of a post-human future, the information ecology of the next few decades, driven in part by personal genomics, will be even more human as the banal and impersonal decisions that define modern life are taken over by automatons.",industry,30,not included

The attack is growing into a serious problem and raising broad attention in reality when recently many brand domains have been attacked such as apple.com (Apple Inc.), adobe.com (Adobe Systems Incorporated), lloydsbank.co.uk (Lloyds Bank), etc. Therefore, how to detect visual homograph becomes a hot topic both in industry and research community. Several existing papers and tools have been proposed to find some homographs of a given domain based on different subsets of certain look-alike characters, or based on an analysis on the registered International Domain Name (IDN) database. However, we still lack a scalable and systematic approach that can detect sufficient homographs registered by attackers with a high accuracy and low false positive rate. In this paper, we construct a classification model to detect homographs and potential homographs registered by attackers using machine learning on feasible and novel features which are the visual similarity on each character and some selected information from Whois. The implementation results show that our approach can bring up to 95.90% of accuracy with merely 3.27% of false positive rate. Furthermore, we also make an empirical analysis on the collected homographs and found some interesting statistics along with concrete misbehaviors and purposes of the attackers.",industry,31,not included

The concept of virtual and augmented reality hasn’t changed radically in the past 30 years, but VR and AR devices and software, and content have gone through a significant evolutionary path, and have already experienced several growth spikes. VR and AR technologies can be applied not only in entertainment and games. Many experts believe that virtual and augmented reality, along with Big Data, cloud technologies, artificial intelligence and some others, will become the key technologies of the 4th industrial revolution. VR and AR also have the potential to become the next big computing platform. Today VR and AR technologies help not only to create conceptually new markets, but also to disrupt existing ones. This article discusses the evolution of the VR and AR concepts and technologies and current market trends. The results of the survey show the key obstacles for the mass distribution of AR and VR technologies: high implementation and operational costs of AR/VR solutions; lack of high-quality content and imperfect devices, implicit effectiveness of their use. Based on the empirical study, a rather extensive list of benefits from using virtual and augmented reality technologies has been drawn up: faster and cheaper learning, training and guiding processes, increase in their efficiency, the reduction of the costs of elements and supplies needed, training support personnel; reducing potential risks to life and health of employees and other people while special training (medical operations and invasive procedures, evacuation, security, rescue in various emergencies) and the related optimization of the compensations; reducing the number of errors and accelerating the processes of assembling, repairing and operating special equipment, searching for information, necessary details, product location in the warehouse; significant reduction of accidents rate, as well as the exploration costs, due to the early identification of malfunctions; accelerating the pace of the designing and prototyping objects, significantly reducing the cost and duration of physical modeling process; improving customer experience, product and trading platforms design, that leads to corresponding increase in volume of sales; improving (simplifying) of communication and increasing its effectiveness.",industry,32,not included

However, one fundamental limitation of a Cloud is the connectivity with end devices. Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications.
                  In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise. The adoption of a methodology for machine learning-based classification constitutes a first step towards the definition of QoS provisioning mechanisms in Fog computing.

Recent advancements in sensor technology and artificial intelligence mechanisms have led to a rapid increase in research and development of robotic orthoses or ‘exoskeletons’ to support people with mobility problems. The purpose of this case study was to provide insight into the lived reality of using the assistive robotic exoskeleton ReWalk. Method. We used ethnographic techniques to explore the everyday experience and use of the assistive robotic device. Results. We found that the appropriation and integration of the technology within the patient’s everyday lives required a social and collaborative effort, which continued into use. The decisions to utilise the technology (or not) was closely tied to physical, social, cultural, environmental, and psychological factors. Consequently, there was much variation in patients’ perception of the technology and opportunities for support. Four themes emerged: a) Meaning of mobility—physical mobility represents more than functional ability. Its present socio-cultural meaning is associated with an individual’s self-identity and life priorities. b) Accomplishing body-technique—integration with the body requires a long process of skill acquisition and re-embodiment. c) Adaptation and adjustment in use—successful use of the technology was characterised by ongoing adjustment and adaptation of the technology and ways of using it. d) Human element—introduction and sustained use of the exoskeleton demand a social and collaborative effort across the user’s professional and lay resources.

It is a fundamental kernel that enables head-mounted augmented/virtual reality devices and autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles. A noticeable recent trend in visual SLAM is to apply computationand memory-intensive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that outperform traditional hand-designed feature-based methods [1]. For each video frame, CNN-extracted features are matched with stored keypoints to estimate the agent's 6-DoF pose by solving a perspective-n-points (PnP) non-linear optimization problem (Fig. 7.3.1, left). The agent's long-term trajectory over multiple frames is refined by a bundle adjustment process (BA, Fig. 7.3.1 right), which involves a large-scale (~120 variables) non-linear optimization. Visual SLAM requires massive computation (&gt;250GOP/s) in the CNN-based feature extraction and matching, as well as datadependent dynamic memory access and control flow with high-precision operations, creating significant low-power design challenges. Software implementations are impractical, resulting in 0.2s runtime with a ~3GHz CPU+ GPU system with &gt;100MB memory footprint and &gt;100W power consumption. Prior ASICs have implemented either an incomplete SLAM system [2,3] that lacks estimation of ego-motion or employed a simplified (non-CNN) feature extraction and tracking [2,4,5] that limits SLAM quality and range. A recent ASIC [5] augments visual SLAM with an off-chip high-precision inertial measurement unit (IMU), simplifying the computational complexity, but incurring additional power and cost overhead.",multimedia,52,not included

Because of the diversity of the sub-tasks, the layers within and across the DNN models are highly heterogeneous in operation and shape. Diverse layer operations and shapes are major challenges for a fixed dataflow accelerator (FDA) that employs a fixed dataflow strategy on a single DNN accelerator substrate since each layer prefers different dataflows (computation order and parallelization) and tile sizes. Reconfigurable DNN accelerators (RDAs) have been proposed to adapt their dataflows to diverse layers to address the challenge. However, the dataflow flexibility in RDAs is enabled at the cost of expensive hardware structures (switches, interconnects, controller, etc.) and requires per-layer reconfiguration, which introduces considerable energy costs. Alternatively, this work proposes a new class of accelerators, heterogeneous dataflow accelerators (HDAs), which deploy multiple accelerator substrates (i.e., sub-accelerators), each supporting a different dataflow. HDAs enable coarser-grained dataflow flexibility than RDAs with higher energy efficiency and lower area cost comparable to FDAs. To exploit such benefits, hardware resource partitioning across sub-accelerators and layer execution schedule need to be carefully optimized. Therefore, we also present Herald, a framework for co-optimizing hardware partitioning and layer scheduling. Using Herald on a suite of AR/VR and MLPerf workloads, we identify a promising HDA architecture, Maelstrom, which demonstrates 65.3% lower latency and 5.0% lower energy compared to the best fixed dataflow accelerators and 22.0% lower energy at the cost of 20.7% higher latency compared to a state-of-the-art reconfigurable DNN accelerator (RDA). The results suggest that HDA is an alternative class of Pareto-optimal accelerators to RDA with strength in energy, which can be a better choice than RDAs depending on the use cases.",multimedia,55,included

We made use of customized photorealistic avatars for the implementation of both the high-end version (based on Facebook's Oculus) and the low-end version (based on Google's cardboard) of our platform. Under the Selfattachment therapeutic framework, the causes of mental disorders such as chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the individual's insecure attachment with their primary caregiver during childhood and their subsequent problems in affect regulation. The conventional approach (without VR) to Selfattachment requires that the individual uses their childhood photographs to recall their childhood memories and then imagine that the child that they were is present with them. They thus establish a compassionate relationship with their childhood self and then, using love songs and dancing, create an affectional bond with them. Their adult self subsequently role plays a good parent and interacts with their imagined childhood self to perform various developmental and re-parenting activities. The goal is to enhance their capacities for self-regulation of emotion, which can lead them into earning secure attachment. It is hypothesized that our immersive virtual reality platform - which enables the users to interact with their customized 3D photorealistic childhood avatar - offers either a better alternative or at least a complementary visual tool to the conventional imaginal approach to Self-attachment. The platform was developed in Unity 3D, a cross-platform game engine, and takes advantage of the itSeez3D Avatar SDK for generating a customized photorealistic 3D avatar head from a 2D childhood image of the user. The platform also offers facial and body animations for some of the basic emotional states such as Happy, Sad, Scared and Joyful and it allows modifications to the avatar body (height/ width) and clothing color. A study to compare the use of the avatar-based approach (VR) to Self-attachment with the conventional photo-based approach showed promising results. Almost 85% of the participants reported that their photorealistic childhood avatar in VR was more relatable than their childhood photos. Both low-end and high-end VR based approaches were unanimously reported to be more effective than the conventional imaginal approach.

Our work is based on a recent proposed deep learning model, pix2pix, that can successfully transform an image from one domain into another domain, such as from line drawings to color images. However, the pix2pix model relies on the condition that input images should come from the same distribution, which is usually hard for applying it to real human computer interaction tasks, where the input from users differs from individual to individual. To address the problem, we propose a compensation method of two-stage image generation. In the first stage, we ask users to indicate their design preference with an easy task, such as tuning clothing landmarks, and use the input to generate a compensation input. With the compensation input, in the second stage, we then concatenate it with the real sketch from users to generate a perceptual better result. In addition, to deploy the two-stage image generation neural network in augmented reality environment, we designed and implemented a mobile application where users can create fashion design referring to real world human models.

to ambulate. Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI)
controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like
ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested
a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control
of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).
  Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following
10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking
kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed
to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a
goal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the
KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops
at designated points within the VRE.
  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was
77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),
with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 +/-
1.0 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 +/- 53 sec completion time (perfect =
211 sec). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those
of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions.
  Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode
users' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced
control of ambulation after only a 10-minute training. The ability to achieve
such BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of

The study illustrates the effectiveness of hard-soft technology while investigating the peculiarities of heat generation and heat consumption in the internal combustion engine, which will combine mathematic and algorithmic means of modelling as well as the means of real simulation. The necessity of hard-soft technology introduction arises from the excessive complexity of thermal phenomena occurring in the internal combustion engine (ICE), and the inability to fully subordinate these phenomena to existing analytical models.
The combination of original and analytical properties, reality and virtual reality while modelling the processes in internal combustion engines allows us to substantially improve the quality of information in the process of design and engine construction. Taking this into consideration, there are some natural grounds to apply principles of heuristic self-organization, self-learning, means of the neural networks, etc. in the design implementation.
The study demonstrates the example of modelling the real working space of ICE with the forced start that serves as a supplement to the mathematical algorithmic two-zone model of heat generation / heat consumption / heat extraction.
The basic information that can be obtained by means of hard-soft technology in the framework of, for example, the two-zone model of the work process in the gasoline engine, is the variability with the change in the angle of rotation of the crankshaft of the engine: absolute pressure (indicative diagram); absolute temperature; heat transmitted inside the cylinder between zones; coefficient of excess air; coefficient of heat transfer; intensity of heat extraction in the process of combustion of fuel; intensity of heat transfer through the walls of the cylindeДетерміністичне і в певному сенсі «лінійне» трактування світу часто веде до визнання того, що чим точнішою потрібна його модель, тим складнішою вона має бути (як у разі формалізованого відтворення реальної системи, так і у разі втілення бажаних системних властивостей у процесі формалізованого синтезу чогось нового).

Procedural methods like finite-state transducers and augmented transition networks have proven to be beneficial to implement semantic fusion. They are compliant with rapid development cycles that are common for the development of user interfaces, in contrast to machine-learning approaches that require time-costly training and optimization. We identify seven fundamental requirements for the implementation of semantic fusion: Action derivation, continuous feedback, context-sensitivity, temporal relation support, access to the interaction context, as well as the support of chronologically unsorted and probabilistic input. A subsequent analysis reveals, however, that there is currently no solution for fulfilling the latter two requirements. As the main contribution of this article, we thus present the Concurrent Cursor concept to compensate these shortcomings. In addition, we showcase a reference implementation, the Concurrent Augmented Transition Network (cATN), that validates the concept’s feasibility in a series of proof of concept demonstrations as well as through a comparative benchmark. The cATN fulfills all identified requirements and fills the lack amongst previous solutions. It supports the rapid prototyping of multimodal interfaces by means of five concrete traits: Its declarative nature, the recursiveness of the underlying transition network, the network abstraction constructs of its description language, the utilized semantic queries, and an abstraction layer for lexical information.

system for geometric reconstruction, object-class segmentation and learning of
3D scenes. Using our system, a user can walk into a room wearing a depth camera
and a virtual reality headset, and both densely reconstruct the 3D scene and
interactively segment the environment into object classes such as 'chair',
'floor' and 'table'. The user interacts physically with the real-world scene,
touching objects and using voice commands to assign them appropriate labels.
These user-generated labels are leveraged by an online random forest-based
machine learning algorithm, which is used to predict labels for previously
unseen parts of the scene. The entire pipeline runs in real time, and the user
stays 'in the loop' throughout the process, receiving immediate feedback about
the progress of the labelling and interacting with the scene as necessary to
refine the predicted segmentation.Comment: 33 pages, Project: http://www.semantic-paint.com, Code:

These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for ""digital phenotyping"" and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions - including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders - as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.",multimedia,94,not included

AI systems which perform relatively simple tasks in the early stages of the development period are expected to become fully or largely autonomous in the near future. Thanks to this, AI which includes the concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and autonomy, has begun to play an important role in producing and using smart arms. However, questions about AI-Based Lethal Weapon Systems (AILWS) and attacks that can be carried out by such systems have not been fully answered under legal aspect. More particularly, it is a controversial issue who will be responsible for the actions that an AILWS has committed. In this article, we discussed whether AILWS can commit offense in the context of the Rome Statute, examined the applicable law regarding the responsibility of AILWS, and tried to assess whether these systems can be held responsible in the context of international law, crime of aggression, and individual responsibility. It is our finding that international legal rules including the Rome Statute can be applied regarding the responsibility for the act/crime of aggression caused by AILWS. However, no matter how advanced the cognitive capacity of an AI software, it will not be possible to resort to the personal responsibility of this kind of system since it has no legal personality at all. In such a case, responsibility will remain with the actors who design, produce, and use the system. Last but not least, since no AILWS software does have specific codes of conduct that can make legal and ethical reasonings for today, at the end of the study it was recommended that states and non-governmental organizations together with manifacturers should constitute the necessary ethical rules written in software programs to prevent these systems from unlawful acts and to develop mechanisms that would restrain AI from working outside human control.",science,97,not included

                  Social skills training (SST) intervention has shown its efficacy to improve social dysfunction in patients with psychosis; however the implementation of new skills into patients' everyday functioning is difficult to achieve. In this study, we report results from the application of a virtual reality (VR) integrated program as an adjunct technique to a brief social skills intervention for patients with schizophrenia. It was predicted that the intervention would improve social cognition and performance of patients as well as generalisation of the learned responses into patient's daily life.
               
                  Methods
                  Twelve patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed the study. They attended sixteen individual one-hour sessions, and outcome assessments were conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment and four-month follow-up.
               
                  Results
                  The results of a series of repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant improvement in negative symptoms, psychopathology, social anxiety and discomfort, avoidance and social functioning. Objective scores obtained through the use of the VR program showed a pattern of learning in emotion perception, assertive behaviours and time spent in a conversation.

Drawing on institutional ethnographic approaches, this paper describes the misalignments between how technology is described in government documentation, and how it is deployed in social service delivery. We argue that the propagation of ethical principles legitimates established new public management strategies, and pre-empts questions regarding the efficacy of AI development; instead positioning implementation as inevitable and, provided an ethical framework is adopted, laudable.

The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.SCOPUS: ar.jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe",science,101,not included

An optimal antibiotic therapy (ABX) is paramount for success. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a well investigated biomarker that allows close monitoring of the infection and management of ABX. It has proven to be a cost-efficient diagnostic tool. In Diagnoses Related Groups (DRG) based reimbursement systems, hospitals get only a fixed amount of money for certain treatments. Thus it's very important to obtain an optimal balance of clinical treatment and resource consumption namely the length of stay in hospital and especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We investigated which economic effects an optimized PCT-based algorithm for antibiotic management could have.</p> <p>Materials and methods</p> <p>We collected inpatient episode data from 16 hospitals. These data contain administrative and clinical information such as length of stay, days in the ICU or diagnoses and procedures. From various RCTs and reviews there are different algorithms for the use of PCT to manage ABX published. Moreover RCTs and meta-analyses have proven possible savings in days of ABX (ABD) and length of stay in ICU (ICUD). As the meta-analyses use studies on different patient populations (pneumonia, sepsis, other bacterial infections), we undertook a short meta-analyses of 6 relevant studies investigating in sepsis or ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). From this analyses we obtained savings in ABD and ICUD by calculating the weighted mean differences. Then we designed a new PCT-based algorithm using results from two very recent reviews. The algorithm contains evidence from several studies. From the patient data we calculated cost estimates using German National standard costing information for the German G-DRG system.</p> <p>We developed a simulation model where the possible savings and the extra costs for (in average) 8 PCT tests due to our algorithm were brought into equation.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>We calculated ABD savings of -4 days and ICUD reductions of -1.8 days. our algorithm contains recommendations for ABX onset (PCT ≥ 0.5 ng/ml), validation whether ABX is appropriate or not (Delta from day 2 to day 3 ≥ 30% indicates inappropriate ABX) and recommendations for discontinuing ABX (PCT ≤ 0.25 ng/ml).</p> <p>We received 278, 264 episode datasets where we identified by computer-based selection 3, 263 cases with sepsis. After excluding cases with length of stay (LOS) too short to achieve the intended savings, we ended with 1, 312 cases with ICUD and 268 cases without ICUD. Average length of stay of ICU-patients was 27.7 ± 25.7 days and for Non-ICU patients 17.5 ± 14.6 days respectively. ICU patients had an average of 8.8 ± 8.7 ICUD.</p> <p>After applying the simulation model on this population we calculated possible savings of € -1, 163, 000 for ICU-patients and € -36, 512 for Non-ICU patients.</p> <p>Discussion</p> <p>Our findings concerning the savings from the reduction of ABD are consistent with other publications. Savings ICUD had never been economically evaluated so far. our algorithm is able to possibly set a new standard in PCT-based ABX. However the findings are based on data modelling. The algorithm will be implemented in 5-10 hospitals in 2012 and effects in clinical reality measured 6 months after implementation.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Managing sepsis with daily monitoring of PCT using our refined algorithm is suitable to save substantial costs in hospitals.

Our results show that both methods can find an optimal solution in 130 iterations. BO converges faster than CMA-ES within its constrained range, while CMA-ES finds the optimum in the continuous space.

It allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through.MethodsMedical trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30min of repeated catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring.ResultsTwenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device (EPD) was deployed (9.4min for the PT vs. 8.1min for the FT, p=0.02). Total time (26.3 vs. 25.5min, p=0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4min, p=0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p=0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 58.0ml, p=0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8min, p=0.31) and time to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9min, p=0.94) were similar. Qualitative performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p=0.49) and NOTSS (p>0.05 for all categories) were also comparable.ConclusionsPart- and full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative performance of a simulated CAS intervention. This finding makes a patient-specific rehearsal more efficient and may increase the feasibility of implementation of this technology into medical practice",health,111,not included

There are objective reasons, significant advantages, and serious business challenges. The ongoing digital transformation creates some of the largest economic, political and social challenges for the European Union. Despite new opportunities, it is frequently perceived as a threat to traditional business models, current organizational structures, and well-established business operations. Economic question about the competitiveness and capabilities in new technologies are linked to needs of skills and knowledge developing in Europe. It is an incredible for exploring the processes. For Ukrainian researchers, this issue may be interesting in the context of the European integration and understanding of digitalization processes in the EU, comparing them with Ukrainian realities, and identifying possibilities for benchmarking of the European experience. The main aim of the paper is to focus on the skills necessary to managers to operate in a digital era.There are no doubts that the nature of work changes, new jobs emerge while others disappear, so people need to gain new skills. Approximately 30% of the current jobs in the European Union may disappear over the next 25 years with the emergence of new professions requiring advanced digital skills [1]. Therefore, a critical element in the digital economy is to define and to acquire skills for business development in digital era. We are trying to focus on the skills critical for the EU’s growth and mitigation of losses caused by the digital transformation (by cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence.An important factor to be taken into consideration is the fact that the society is not fully aware of the real situation. Digital business (or digital era, digital transformation) is taken for almost granted. But in reality the digital economy is highly concentrated in two countries (USA and China):-       50% of global spending on IoT-       more than 75% of the cloud computing market-       75% of all patents related to blockchain technologies [2].Moreover:-       about 10 % of the EU labour force has no digital skills;-       35 % of the EU labour does not have basic digital skills;-       about 28 % of the EU's internet users have no software-related skills [1].Also it is important to understand that digital skills which can be defined as abilities to use digital devices, communication applications, and networks to find information are (to some extend) basic or consumer skills that are mechanically honed and do not require serious intellectual effort. While digital skills also mean abilities to manage information, it is a higher level skill, but it is still a basic skill in the digital age. The shift of value creation towards digital platforms, new security and standard solutions, big data usage and data quality call for more complex skills. According to UNCTAD Digital Economy Report 2019, the expansion of the Internet of Things and various data-driven business models will require specialists who can convert big data into information and knowledge that are:- data scientist;- data engineers;- data architects and data visualizators [2].And we're focusing on the ability to use business opportunities including the increasing amounts of data. These require broader skill sets, skills to combine analytical, software and information systems with business. Data analysts and scientists also need to be business savvy to help enterprises capture business opportunities from their analyses. Multiple skills that combine sound technical skills with entrepreneurial skills and vertical and business process management expertise are particularly important [3].It is noteworthy that only 12% of EU enterprises used big data in 2018, 9% of EU enterprises - in 2016 [3]. That is, 88% and 91% did not use. Accordingly, the issue is not only about to capture business opportunities but skills to see the existing opportunities at least. That is why the EU awareness campaigns were oriented on alert the real picture: – WATIFY - launched in 2014 with the goal to push people towards concrete action to create their digital start-up, or digitally transform their business;– e-Skills for jobs and growth – launched in 2014 with an idea to strengthen competences and e-leadership;–  Start Up Europe Initiative to strengthen the environment for Web Entrepreneurs to start and stay in Europe.In 2018, the vast majority (92 %) of EU enterprises with at least 10 persons employed used the internet 77 % of EU enterprises have a website. In 2018, 1 in 5 EU enterprises employed ICT specialists; the percentage of large enterprises employing ICT specialists (75 %) is more than 4 times higher than that for SMEs (18 %) [3]. The difference in big data and Internet usage statistics may be explained by an understanding of the benefits and personal routine of the latest one in life. Once upon a time, such breakthrough and unusual things became household. And big data or the Internet of Things are not conscious, and it is impossible to build a business model on the obscure.That is a problem for the leaders of European companies in understanding the potential of artificial intelligence or data analytics. It is not just about that Europe needs an additional 20 million early stage entrepreneurs to close the gap with the US and China, but also about a high intensity of utilization of novel digital technologies (social, big data, mobile and cloud solutions) to improve business operations, invent new models in three directions:– ability to reach out and partner with customers more effectively;– inner processes;– business models - the way value is created, delivered and captured.The digital transformation from a European management angle should include strategic vision how to combine analytical, software and information systems with business. Skills for European business development in digital era refers to leadership in the new era, it does not matter traditional or digital business – the reality is changing in general.The skills for European business development must combine:- ICT user skills to apply systems as tools in support of own work. It can be common software tools or specialised tools supporting business functions within industry;- skills required for researching, developing, designing, strategic planning, managing, producing, consulting, marketing, selling, integrating, installing, administering, maintaining, supporting and servicing ICT systems;- business skills correspond to the capabilities to exploit opportunities provided by ICT; to ensure more efficient and effective performance of different types of organisations; to explore possibilities for new ways of conducting business and organisational processes; and to establish new businesses [3].A little different set of skills is proposed by publication “E-Leadership Digital Skills for SMEs” of the EC [4]:- strategic leadership skills to lead inter‐disciplinary staff, and influence stakeholders across boundaries (functional, geographic);– business savvy: innovate business and operating models, delivering value to organisations;– digital savvy: envision and drive change for business performance, exploiting digital technology trends as innovation opportunities [4].To summarize, it should be noted that the new era creates opportunities for all businesses, the question is to see these opportunities and successfully use them. Entrepreneurship and business may not be fundamentally changing at any time, but the tool usage requires understanding, if not details, so the overall potential and range of capabilities of this tool. In the digital age, digital skills (both basic and complex) are understanding how to use the tool. On the other hand, the strategic leadership skills and the business savvy.",industry,113,not included

The automation of software testing activities is essential to certify productivity and effectiveness in such activities. Test automation leads testing activities to be conducted under systematic and accurate criteria, raising the chance of testers to reveal faults or inconsistencies. Test oracles are elementary members in software testing automation, being the mechanism responsible for indicating the correctness of software outputs. In testing environments, test oracles can be effectively implemented based on several sources of information about the Software Under Testing (SUT): software specifications, assertions, formal methods (Finite State Machines (FSM), formal specifications, etc, machine-learning methods, and metamorphic relations. Regardless of the implementation strategy, test oracles are vulnerable to false positive/negative verdicts, configuring what the literature describes as the oracle problem. Therefore, test oracles are a non-trivial and challenging object of studies of the software engineering research area. SUTs outputs in unusual formats make it harder the oracle problem. Audio, images, three-dimensional objects, virtual reality environments, complex statistical compositions, etc, are examples of non-trivial output formats. In the software testing context, SUTs with unusual outputs can be called complex-output systems. In this doctorate dissertation, we propose and evaluate a novel test oracle approach for complex-output systems called feature-based test oracles. The purpose of feature-based test oracles is the appropriation of a processing image technique called Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) to collect information from features extracted from the SUTs outputs to compose test oracles. Given a query image, CBIR combines feature extraction and similarity functions to alleviate the problem of searching for digital images in large databases. In previous research, we have integrated CBIR concepts in a testing framework to support the automation of testing activities in processing image systems and systems with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). In this doctorate dissertation, we extended that framework and its concepts to general complex-output systems, addressing the feature-based test oracle approach. We use Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems to validate empirically our test oracle technique. Through the results of five empirical analyses, three of them conducted in line with problems of a real-world industry TTS system, show the proposed technique is a valuable instrument to automate testing activities and alleviate practitioners efforts on testing complex output systems. We conclude the proposed test oracles are effective because they systematically evaluate the SUTs sensorial output rather than produce verdicts based on subjective specifications. As future work, we plan to conduct investigations towards the reduction of false positives/negatives and the association of the test oracles with machine learning techniques and metamorphic relations.Teste de Software é um dos processos mais importantes da Engenharia de Software, sendo a principal atividade para averiguar a conformidade de requisitos de software e suas saídas. A automatização das atividades de teste é essencial para conferir produtividade e efetividade em tais atividades. A automatização faz com que atividades de teste sejam conduzidas sob critérios sistemáticos e precisos, aumentando a chance dos testadores de revelarem falhas ou inconcistências. Oráculos de teste são membros elementares na automatização do teste de software, sendo o mecanismo responsável por indicar a corretude das saídas do softwre. Em ambientes de teste, oráculos de teste podem ser efetivamente implementados com base em diversos fontes de informação sobre o sistema em teste: especificações de software, assertivas, métodos formais (máquinas de estados finitas, especificações formais, etc), métodos de aprendizagem de máquina e relações metamórficas. Independente da estratégia de implementação, oráculos de teste são vulneráveis a veridictos de falsos positivos/negativos, configurando o que é apresentado na literatura como O problema do Oráculo. Então, na área de engenharia de software, oráculos de teste são objetos de estudo não-triviais e desafiadores. O problema de oráculo é potencializado quando as saídas do sistema em teste são dadas em formatos não triviais como, por exemplo, audio, imagens, objetos tridimensionais, ambientes de realidade virtual, composições estatísticas complexas, etc. No contexto do teste de software, sistemas com saídas não triviais podem ser chamados de sistemas com saídas complexas. Esta tese de doutorado propões e avalia uma nova estratégia de oráculo de teste para sistemas com saídas complexas. O propósito de tal estratégia é a apropriação da técnica de processamento de imagem conhecida como CBIR (Recuperação de Imagem Basead em Conteúdo  CBIR) para coletar informações de características extratídas do sistema em teste, compondo oráculos de teste. A partir de uma imagem de busca, o CBIR combina extração de características e funções de similaridade para aliviar problemas de busca em grandes based de imagens digitais. Em pesquisas anteriores, conceitos de CBIR foram integrados em um arcabouço de teste para apoiar a automatização de atividades de teste em systemas de processamento de imagens e sistemas com interfaces gráficas. Esta tese de doutorado estende o arcabouço e seus conceitos para sistemas com saídas complexas em geral. Sistemas Texto-Fala (TTS) foram utlizados para validações empíricas. Os resultados de seis análises empíricas, duas delas condizidas em consonância com problemas de um TTS industrial, revelam que a técnica proposta é um valioso instrumento para automatizar atividaes de teste e aliviar esforços de profissionais da indústria ao teste sistemas com saídas complexas. Conclui-se que a efetividade dos oráculos de teste propostos são devido às sistemáticas análises do conteúdo das saídas dos sistemas em teste, em vez da análises de especificações subjetivas. Os trabalhos futuros vislumbrados devem ser conduzidos no intuito de reduzir número de falsos positivos/negativos e a associação dos oráculos de teste com técnicas de aprendizado de máquina e relações metamórficas",industry,114,not included
,to_check,core,HAL CCSD,04/12/2014 00:00,core,élements de conception de systèmes embarqués fortement contraints,,"In the past decades, embedded systems become more and more present in our daily life. They are present in our wallet, in our car, in our house appliances and the current tendency is to control more and more things by using them. Major companies already started to envision the future of internet which become known as the Internet of Things. In the next years, more and more of our things will be smart, connected... and subject to software flaws.Micro-controllers, very small devices with a few hundreds bytes of memory, are at the heart of this revolution. They become cheaper, smaller and more powerful. Yet, contrary to the technologies used in our desktop computers or our server farms, the goal of the industry that creates these devices is not power. Indeed, controlling temperature in your home or humidity in your wine cellar does not need Gigahertz core. It even does not need multiple cores. What these devices need is to be cheap, to be able to be produced in very high volumes and to use small amount of electrical energy. In this context, the moore's law does not help us to have more cores in one device, but it allows to produce more devices with the same amount of silicon. The research I made in the past years try to reduce the gap between cheap software and robust and efficient software for these devices. I think that, by providing smart tools and production toolchains we can help junior or non specialized developers so that they can produce good embedded software for a reasonable development cost. I also focus my work on optimizing and providing efficient and secure software and network protocols, so that the Internet of Things can become a reality while respecting user privacy and being sustainable from a energy point of view.I focused my research on three aspects. First, I focused on how to allow larger softwares do be developped in embedded systems. In particular, we proposed techniques to allow Java/JavaCard code to be executed from a non-addressable memory using a full software cache.  I also looked at how to use domain specific languages to ease the implementation of a collaborative network intrusions detection system. Thanks to adapted tools, the software, writen in the DSL, can be compiled for a wide range of probes while offering garanties on the produced software. Last, I focused on energy aware network protocols in the context of smart cities.Au cours des dernières années, les systèmes embarqués sont de plus en plus présents dans notre vie de tous les jours. Ils sont dans notre portefeuille, dans notre voiture ou dans nos appareils ménagers. La tendance actuelle est à contrôler de plus en plus d'objets à l'aide de ces systèmes. Les grands acteurs de l'industrie ont déjà commencé à envisager le futur de l'internet, l'internet des objets. Dans les années à venir, de plus en plus de nos objets seront « intelligents », connectés... et sujets à des fautes logicielles.Les micro contrôleurs, de minuscules ordinateurs possédant quelques centaines d'octets de mémoire, sont au coeur de cette révolution. Ils deviennent de moins en moins cher et de plus en plus puissant. Néanmoins, à la différence de nos ordinateurs de bureau ou des serveurs, le but de l'industrie des micro contrôleurs n'est pas la puissance. En effet, contrôler la température de notre maison et le taux d'humidité de notre cave à vin ne nécessite pas des processeurs cadencés à plusieurs gigahertz. Cela ne nécessite même pas plusieurs coeurs de calculs. Le véritable besoin de ces équipements est d'être bons marché, d'être produits en très grands volumes, d'êtres petits, facilement intégrables et d'utiliser une faible quantité d'énergie électrique. Le meilleur exemple de cette tendance est très certainement la carte à puce. Depuis le début des années 90, de plus en plus de cartes à puce sont produites, vendues et utilisées dans le monde. Cependant, elles n'en restent pas moins de tout petits équipements d'une puissance inférieure de plusieurs ordres de grandeur de nos ordinateurs de bureau. Quand il s'agit de développer du logiciel pour ces équipements, un développeur débutant n'est généralement pas suffisamment préparé et ne sera pas capable d'écrire du logiciel efficace pour ces cibles avant de longue années passées à gagner de l'expérience et de l'expertise. Si le logiciel que l'ont souhaite produire doit être efficace, sûr et correct au sens le plus strict du terme, l'industrie doit compter sur des développeurs très spécialisés, expérimentés et donc chers. Les acteurs industriels ont donc deux alternatives : produire du logiciel bon marché, mais assez inefficaceet défectueux ou dépenser une somme importante pour le développement et fournir un logiciel de bonne qualité. On peu aisément supposer que la tendance actuelle est au logiciel bon marché, et que la probabilité que le logiciel qui équipera les millions d'équipements formant l'internet des objets sera de piètre qualité et offrira quantité de failles que des acteurs malveillants se feront une joie d'exploiter si rien n'est fait pour rendre bon marché le développement correct de logiciels embarqués.Mes recherches de ces dernières années vont dans le sens de la réduction du fossé séparant logiciels bon marché et logiciels sûrs et performants. Je suis convaincu qu'en offrant des outils « intelligents » et des chaînes de production logicielle efficaces, nous pouvons aider les développeurs débutants, ou non spécialisés, à produire du logiciel embarqué de bonne qualité pour un coût de développement raisonnable. J'ai également porté mon attention sur l'optimisation et la sécurisation des logiciels et des protocoles réseau afin que l'internet des objets puisse devenir une réalité tout en respectant la vie privée des utilisateurs et en offrant une alternative durable sur le plan énergétique.Je me suis principalement intéressé à trois champs de recherche. Tout d'abord, j'ai cherché à permettre l'utilisation de techniques de développement standard (objets, composants, programmation en Java…) à la faible capacité mémoire des équipements embarqués. A l'inverse, je me suis également intéressé à l'utilisation de langages dédiés à une application afin de permettre à des spécialistes du domaine de la sécurité réseau d'exprimer des algorithmes de détection d'intrusions. A l'aide d'une suite d'outils dédiée, ces algorithmes sont compilés et optimisés automatiquement pour être utilisés dans une architecture distribuée de sondes embarquées. Enfin, je me suis intéressé aux protocoles réseau économes en énergie pour interconnecter les équipements embarqués dans le cadre des villes intelligentes",industry,115,not included

based on movement and sound interaction",,"Computer generated images have always drawn the attention of millions of people in their different roles: students, professors, researchers, designers, movie directors, etc. It is not only the magic of generating synthetic, static and/or dynamic images, emulations or simulations of reality, but of capturing all the creative abilities of the human being to narrate events, from the memory of the past, descriptions of current reality and projections towards the future. In other words, they may be timeless images and malleable towards the infinite.

In them rests the freedom of expression in a chromatic and three-dimensional way where sometimes it is difficult to see whether we are in the face of something real or virtual. It is the charm of the viewing power of communication where an image is always worth more than a thousand words. Not for nothing when the first graphics appeared to depict the numerical information in the offices, it marked the beginning of the use of computers in the businesses with professional purposes until they reached the home. It was these synthetic images which collaborated to change the meaning of the PC initials, that is, from professional computer to personal computer.

The risk lies in the fact that those who manage those images respect the final viewer, at the moment they are presented to his/her eyes. That is, a transparent communication avoiding manipulation through them. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the written word takes again a prevailing place in the communicative process, and one goes back to the time of the appearance of print. It is in this regressive period where the human and social factors may be inserted, which generate different types of structures which do not change over time.

Although we are in one of the most dynamic sectors of the current interactive systems, we may come across in some places of the Old Continent with dogmas and their supporters, who slow down the whole creative process which entails working with these computer-made images. Now if the human and social factors are positive, in view of the constant advances of the graphic hardware and software, the only limit that exists is the imagination or originality at the moment of generating static and/or dynamic images in 2D and 3D.

Computer graphics and computer animation along with text, audio and video have been key in the momentum of the Internet phenomenon of the 20th century. In the new millennium they have been the main means of drawing the attention of the users to the screens of a great variety of devices of classical computing.

There are millions of users who decide to purchase computer equipment because of the images that they can see on the screens. These images gain in quality thanks to their generation from scratch and thanks also to myriad techniques, methods, algorithms, etc. related to computer graphics down to the access to the information stored in the database, such as decompressed files with multimedia information available via the interaction of the user through the various peripherals.

Virtual images are generated in 2D and/or 3D, thanks to democratization of the pixels in 1990 \u2013 2000. Users are now capable of generating images in movement for 3D starting from photographs with digital cameras or the commercial applications to generate films with computer animations.

In this whole productive process, whether it is at a personal or an industrial level the cost factor is always present, in the equation of maximum quality in the least possible time. To reach that goal it is necessary to resort to several quality attributes that have an influence from the design stage right until the programming of the applications used in the context of graphic informatics.

Our intention in the current handbook is to show an essential part of those strategies and also the latest breakthroughs in all that which is directly or indirectly related to computer graphics, computer animation, database, software quality, hypermedia, design, communicability, interfaces, cloud computing, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, computer-aided design, mixed reality, models, techniques and methods of computer science, etc.

Some of the works that make up the current compendium have been presented orally by their authors in the following international conference in Venice, Italy: SETECEC 2012 \u2013First International Conference on Software and Emerging Technologies for Education, Culture, Entertainment, and Commerce: New Directions in Multimedia Mobile Computing, Social Networks, Human-Computer Interaction and Communicability, and international symposium in Valle d'Aosta, Italy: CCGIDIS 2012 \u2013Second International Symposium on Communicability, Computer Graphics and Innovative Design for Interactive Systems.

The innovation and originality of those proposals has been the reason for which the authors have been invited to enlarge their works submitting again the new versions to an assessment process of said works by the members of the scientific committee. Consequently, these are works that have gone satisfactorily through a double process of international selection. In the next section a short introductory presentation of the research works that make up the current compendium is given:

The authors Luigi Barazzetti and  Marco Scaioni present an interesting work \u201cTransforming Images and Laser Scans into 3D Models\u201d where theory and practice converge in the context of 3D images. They introduce all details of the use of a laser scanner to obtain high quality three-dimensional images and accuracy in the maintenance and the virtual reconstruction of cultural heritage, for instance. Besides, they comprehensively describe computer vision and photogrammetric 3D modeling techniques that are mainly based on images or laser scans. The description further covers the integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or theodolite data allowing precise geo-referencing. The main goal they have set themselves is to indicate the reliability and robustness of their combined use for real surveys. Simultaneously a set of real examples serves to illustrate each one of the advantages and disadvantages of the used methods and techniques. In these examples the resolution of complex problems and with reduced costs can be verified. Each one of the issues is approached in a didactic way which facilitates the understanding even of the diverse devices used for the measurements.

Chih-Fang Huang, Chih-Hsiang Liang, and En-Ju Lin are the authors of the chapter \u201cSound-Color Synaesthetic Effect Using Algorithmic Composition with Image for Emotional Release.\u201d In said research they present the qualities of music from an emotive point of view. This is one of the motivations why they spread their study to the field of colors. In this sense, they develop an emotional model for music based on studies of color theory. Another main goal is to present the emotions of the users of a special software starting from the color and the electronic sounds that these represent from the psychological point of view, an approach informed by studies belonging to the set of the music color synesthesis and emotion releasing effect. Throughout the research work the authors explain in a gradual, simple and thorough way each one of the presented concepts with their matching theoretical examples and also the use of a special software for the experiments they have carried out.

The research work \u201cUser-created Interior Design Service Concepts, Interfaces and Outlines for Augmented Reality\u201d has been made by the following authors Tiina Kym\ue4l\ue4inen and Sanni Siltanen. This research work presents us masterfully a design process and the implementation requirements of an interactive interior design system. In said system the use of two focus groups can be detected where the knowledge and the experiences of designers, bloggers and serious amateurs in the field of interior design interact transversally. In that transversal interaction of diverse professionals the presence of user-driven innovation can be seen. The strategies of the conformation of the professionals and the transversal knowledge to the different areas of knowledge are explained with examples. Examples are given, which describe all the aspects of the new technologies applied to augmented reality, the results of tests with real users, the realization of a special software for the three-dimensional visualization of interiors, etc. Each one of the stages of the research project is accompanied by its corresponding textual and graphical explanations. Finally the authors make a wide-ranging reflection about the learned lessons signaling the positive and negative aspects of the used technology and also the future lines of research before their conclusions.

In the context of artificial intelligence, Damijan Novak and Domen Verber show us in their research \u201cNew Generation of Artificial Intelligence for Real-time Strategy Games\u201d the importance of applying it to computer games. The text starts with a complete state of the art overview, where the main notions to which the current research work refers are defined. In it is a constant interrelation among real-time strategy, games and artificial intelligence. The authors signal the importance of these issues within the academic field since they have detected new fields for research, whether in the present or the immediate future. Besides, in this work an excellent comparison example in the open-source real time strategy game development tools can be seen. The main and secondary goals of the text are gradually developed answering to a set of rhetorical questions with practical examples. All of this makes the reading and understanding easier to the potential readers. Their proposal of an enhanced combat artificial intelligence algorithm is striking in a very positive way.

The authors of the chapter \u201cTowards Smart Mobile System for Public Bus Transportation\u201d are Mitja Krajnc, Vili Podgorelec, and Marjan Heri\u10dko. In it converge the use of multimedia mobile phones and the geographical information systems (GPS satellite) for the localization of public buses in the town of Maribor, Slovenia. The system allows the user to see the movement of the buses in the road network through a real-time visualization on a mobile phone. The digital information which replaces the analogical one such as the timetables of the buses on paper support increases the available options of those users to access the public transportation system such as the combination of buses to reach a given destination. Besides, ease of use of the system can be seen since it is based on Windows Phone. Finally a quality attribute of the interactive systems such as the prediction has been incorporated to the system. The goal pursued by its authors is to increase the alternatives the user has at the moment of accessing the interactive information without this having negative repercussions on the visualization of the information inside the interface of the mobile phone.

Under the title \u201cA Learning Environment based on Movement and Sound Interaction\u201d its authors Serena Zanolla, Sergio Canazza, Antonio Rod\ue0, Giovanni De Poli, and Gian Luca Foresti present an Interactive Multimodal Environment for E-learning called \u201cStanza Logo-Motoria.\u201d The experiments carried out with children for the learning of a second language such as English have allowed the authors to carry out several experiments with positive results. A special module has been developed and tested in this sense called English as a Second Language (ESL). The motivation for learning languages in an environment of these characteristics is presented in a detailed way with a special stress on other aspects such as the socialization of early age users through new interactive technologies. Along with this the authors introduce technological aspects of interactive design which have been evolving as the experiments were carried out.

Michele Argiolas, Claudia Loggia, Vittorio Tramontin, and Cristina Trois are the authors of the chapter called \u201cA Web Application to Support Decision Making Process Based on a Bottom-up Approach in Public Buildings\u2019 Green Retrofit.\u201d They introduce a GIS web application related to such topics as green retrofit, public buildings, cost management just to mention three examples. The proposal starts with a comprehensive state of the art in legislation issues as technique of the main and secondary topics approached by its authors. The work shows how the implemented system online may serve to curtail the costs of management of green retrofitting public buildings. The study shows a constant interrelation among several disciplines of the sciences. Each of the issues is very well referenced in the bibliography section and they are developed in a pleasant way for the reader non-specialized in the issues approached at the start. Besides, there is a comparative study of real cases which entail additional advantages to the work developed by each one of the authors of the current text. Finally we can state that we are in front of an excellent triadic example of interrelations among databases, access to the stored information and the management of public administration.

The wide range of the phenomenon of the social networks requires in many of the offered services a set of recommendations. In this sense the authors Sa\u161o Karakati\u10d, Vili Podgorelec, and Marjan Heri\u10dko show in their research work \u201cMerging Social Networks and Semantic Databases to Build Recommendation Service\u201d the potential of linking semantic databases and social networks. Starting from Facebook and Freebase they have fashioned a prototype that uses Java technology. The prototype takes into consideration each one of the key elements for the recommendation of an online service to the potential users of contents in TV format, videogames, music, etc. In this sense we see a novel low cost solution is little by little brought forward by the authors along the pages. Besides, they have made a series of tests with users at the moment of interacting with the software and the hardware used. The results obtained back up the transcendence of the current proposal, and also the future developments they will make in a short time.

The three-dimensional reconstruction of the religious-historical heritage in the province of Avila (Spain) is the main objective of \u201cComputer Graphics to Encourage the Participation in the Virtual Reconstruction of Cultural Heritage: The Example of the Monastery of  Nuestra Se\uf1ora del Risco\u201d author of the chapter whose title is Gonzalo Mart\uedn S\ue1nchez. Starting from a reality which reveals the passing of time and the scarce remains of the walls of the monastery, the author resorts to several techniques using static images in 2D and 3D, such as historical cartography, digital photography, commercial software and open source, etc., for three-dimensional reconstruction. Now the author points out that these techniques from the field of computer graphics must be accompanied by a previous historical study of that is intended to be rebuilt. In this sense the illustrations, as well as the used methodology can serve as a guide for other analogous works.

In \u201cDeveloping Design Guidelines for E-Learning Environments: A War Story\u201d its authors Laura Benvenuti, Maria Menendez Blanco, and Gerrit C. van der Veer, denote the importance of the design, development, evaluation of a system oriented at university e-learning. A comprehensive study of the educational system to be developed with Moodle highlights the intersection between pedagogical theory, interactive design computer programming, among other areas of knowledge when it refers to blended academic education. A course on webculture has allowed the authors to carry out analyses of the web design. The university students belonging to the social sciences (culture, psychology, etc.) have taken part in several processes of heuristic evaluation to reach the goals proposed by the authors of the current research work. The learned lessons, future lines of research and the conclusions are interesting sections to understand the acquired experiences and for new research in the context of the blended education, distance learning, Internet based learning environments to mention a few examples.

The author presents a heuristic study of the evolution of human factors with their educational and social consequences in the context of the pixel of Southern Europe during the years 1990 \u2013 2012, under the title \u201cPixels: Educational Structures and Power Systems.\u201d Simultaneously, it is used for the first time a special language where diachronism interacts with the synchronism of the real examples that are presented, related to the graphics software. Besides, in this first research work are combined different techniques of the social sciences to establish the nodes and links which make up the human and functional structure of all that related to the commercial and educational pixel. Lastly, a series of strategies is put forward to analyse the educational quality of some training centers with regard to computer graphics and its derivations",industry,116,not included

Quello che in particolare si modifica non e’ tanto la professione in quanto tale, che mantiene la principale caratteristica di mediazione dell’informazione, ma l’organizzazione stessa del lavoro dei professionisti della notizia. La scelta dell’argomento della tesi parte dalla considerazione di questo dato di fatto, e la possibilita’ di aver svolto uno stage presso la redazione della free press torinese “Shop in the city”, e' stata l’occasione per indagare direttamente sul campo i meccanismi di fare informazione nell’era digitale.
Partendo da questa prospettiva si e’ cercato innanzitutto di offrire una panoramica dei cambiamenti della professione e dei professionisti all’interno della societa’; un’analisi degli sviluppi tecnologici che hanno contribuito in modo determinante al cambiamento del lavoro di giornalista; un’analisi delle nuove forme di giornalismo che si sviluppano nell’era digitale. Parallelamente, un capitolo-intermezzo viene dedicato a due autori, Richard Florida e McKenzie Wark, i quali, partendo da prospettive diametralmente opposte, arrivano entrambi alla considerazione che nell’era digitale cio’ che rappresenta una vera produttrice di valore per la societa’ e’ la creatività degli individui, che si colloca proprio nell’intreccio tra rete e metropoli, tra virtuale e reale: l’informale diventa la sorgente cui la società attinge per trovare i suoi nuovi contesti produttivi.
Queste considerazioni vengono applicate nella seconda parte del lavoro di tesi in cui viene analizzata la free press torinese “Shop in the city”, sia nella sua realta’ cartacea che soprattutto nella sua forma web. Ciò permette di applicare tutte le considerazioni fatte in fase teorica. In particolare l’analisi dei punti di forza e di debolezza della parte online servono come spunto per presentare un progetto di implementazione del sito seguendo i pilastri della filosofia del web 2.0 e di un maggior coinvolgimento dell’utente, volendo dimostrare che oggi non conta più essere a tutti i costi online con un sito vetrina: occorre, nel terzo millennio che viviamo, fornire un vero servizio agli utenti di modo che essi effettivamente utilizzino il sito e siano fidelizzati alla navigazione.
Lo scopo finale e’ quindi quello di fornire in prima istanza una mappatura cognitiva dello scenario mediale degli ultimi anni, che sia forse utile ai vari dibattiti che alimentano la scena informativa riguardo al futuro dei giornali e ai possibili sviluppi del campo giornalistico attraverso lo sfruttamento delle potenzialita’ dei new media; in seconda istanza, preso il caso pratico di una free press, si propone di offrire un esempio di come migliorare lo sfruttamento delle potenzialità di internet per fare informazione nell’era digitale.
In the third millennium the journalistic profession is going through an evolution and cannot ignore the new technological developments that have become an important and pervasive part of the shared lives of our society. It is not so much the profession itself which is changing, in the sense that it maintains it’s principal role of the mediation and distribution of information, but instead the way in which the work of news professionals is organised.
Based on this assumption, this work begins by offering an overview of the changes to the profession and to the professionals themselves; an analysis of the technological developments that have contributed to determining the changes in the work of a journalist and an analysis of the new forms of journalism that are developing in the digital era. In parallel, a part is dedicated to two authors, Richard Florida and McKenzie Wark, who both arrive at the conclusion that in the digital era that which represents a real increase in value for an organisation is the creativity of individuals, which can be seen as being placed in the crossover of network and metropolis,: the informal becomes the source on which the organisation draws to find it’s new production contexts.
These considerations are applied and discussed in the second part of the thesis in which the Turin-based free press ‘Shop in the city’ is analysed, both in it’s paper and web-based forms. This analysis allows the application of the theories discussed in the relevant part of the thesis and offers a practical example of the reality of journalism in the digital era. In particular, the analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of the online format provide a good basis for the development and presentation of an implementation project for the site, following the philosophies of web 2.0 and of increased user involvement, demonstrating that it is no longer enough simply to be online at all costs, or to only have a ‘window display site’: in this third millennium it is fundamental to provide a real service to users so that they can effectively navigate and make use of the site.
The final aim, therefore, is to provide in the first instance a cognitive map of the field over the past few years, something which may be of use in the various debates that rise in the sector about the future of newspapers and the possible future developments in the field of journalism through the use of new media techniques and methods. In the second instance, with regard to the practical case of a free paper, this thesis proposes an example of how to best make use of the power of the internet to provide information in the digital era",smart cities,118,not included

The problem of organizing state and non-state institutions to combat the spread of fakes in the information space is to establish a parity (balance) between: citizens right to receive reliable/legal information protection, freedom of speech protection and expression (civil liberties) and protection of national interests of Ukraine. The existing imbalance caused by the lack of effective mechanisms to counteract misinformation and its dissemination through social media. In the EU countries at the state level the fight is not against misinformation, but with illegal (harmful, dangerous) content in the media and social media, which is ineffective for Ukraine in the face of existing challenges and threats related to the military conflict and occupation of part of state territory, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.
Previously unresolved parts of the overall problem. An unresolved part of the general problem is the lack of proper scientific substantiation of state mechanisms to combat disinformation and its dissemination in the media and social media.
The aim of the article is to develop strategic approaches and practical recommendations for combating misinformation and its dissemination in Ukraine by social media in the context of information and psychological attacks and the Covid-19 pandemic.
Main material. Digital technologies and information flows form practically all social processes faced by modern society. Thanks to built-in microprocessors, algorithmic devices and information systems combine texts, sounds and images that are easily stored and reproduced in digital format. The transfer of mass communication to the Internet has led to the transition of target audiences from traditional media to social networks. Without diminishing the benefits, opportunities and prospects that the digital world opens to humanity, it is necessary to actualize the significance of the negative side of the digital development of mass communication. Digital realities open up new possibilities for the introduction of various manipulation tools, among which misinformation is especially dangerous.
Post-truth interpretation refers to artificial circumstances in which the emotions and personal beliefs of target audiences are more important than objective facts and evidence that become irrelevant, particularly in shaping public opinion and influencing the mass consciousness. Post-truth is not just the opposite of truth, but rather a phenomenon of purposeful introduction of proactive communication, which as a set of different and interconnected actions, due to its recombined qualities and combination of different components misleads recipients of information in order to subdue them. The consequence is a decrease in the level of trust in the received information and media. People are confused, it becomes difficult for them to separate true information from false information, they do not realize what is true and what media can be trusted. The post-truth politics is realized through ""soft"" and gradual transformation of the system of national values and moral principles into so-called alternative ""universal norms of morality"" to absolutize individual freedom, discredit expert opinions and rational discussions, and most importantly to destroy information sovereignty. One of the effective tools for implementing such a policy is gaslighting - a form of organized influence of suggestors (manipulators, politicians, officials) on the processes of public self-identification in order to disorient them and further subdue by provoking uncertainty and doubts about the adequacy of their perception of reality.
Victims of gaslighting no longer trust their values, ideals and beliefs, and in despair they give up and by default fall under the influence of manipulators. Such people do not even realize that they are consumers of misinformation. Global networks are becoming a suitable environment for gas writers, as the constant presence of the vast majority of users on social networks and media channels is caused by the growing level of Internet addiction and digital autism, which create a person first addiction and secondly dangerous state of inability to maintain psychological support. languages with other individuals. That is, the digital transformation of everyday life contributes to the loss of people's communication skills of real communication. The loss of the ability to think adequately, independently and analytically is also negative, because the content and meaning of what is happening around them is formed by social media and digital algorithms of artificial intelligence.
Influencing citizens by external propagandists’ manipulation means disseminate not only criminal and illegal content through social media, but also directly implement political scenarios of changes in national values, the overthrow of the government, provoke armed conflicts, and so on. Disinformation contributes to a geometrically progressive increase in the incidence of the population, which leads to the introduction by the authorities of some regulatory (remediation) measures that may impair freedom of speech and freedom of expression, restrict freedom of assembly and access to public information.
In order to obtain the necessary parity between the appropriateness of the application of regulatory measures to combat misinformation to protect the right to reliable and lawful information and the exercise of civil liberties (rights to freedom expression), it is necessary to legally define the grounds, limits and criteria limitation. The dissemination of harmful information cannot be overcome post-factum with the help of targeted sanctions, under these conditions rapid preventive measures are needed. In this context, the media play a key role in combating fakes and are accountable to the state and society for failing to provide accurate and reliable information to the public.
Social media units, multinational corporations (digital producers), administrators of social networking platforms, non-governmental organizations and international institutions, civil society and independent media are the subjects of counteraction to the spread of disinformation by social media.
Conclusions and recommendations. The significance of the negative consequences of the digital development of mass communication is actualized, the virtual reality of which opens new possibilities for the introduction of various manipulation tools, among which misinformation carries a special danger. It has been proven that misinformation is successfully disseminated through aggressive information campaigns and lack of knowledge about threats and existing vulnerabilities of society, and more effectively affects target audiences by disrupting the interaction (cooperation and communication) of actors to counter its dissemination at the national and international levels. It is substantiated that modern management processes are formed under the influence of post-truth policy, one of the effective tools of which is gaslighting.
The main factors that contribute to the spread of misinformation through social media are identified: the effectiveness of the impact on the mass consciousness; scale, high speed and rate of distribution; stability of online presence (causes cumulative effect); intentional promotion of content by artificially adding it to disseminated information flows through popular media and resources; high quality, multidimensionality and variety of fake products, which are perfectly combined in the form of texts, images and videos; easy availability, high-tech and convenience of software for creating fakes.
The necessity of disseminating positive Ukrainian narratives by social media as a tool to counteract misinformation and information defense of the country has been proved. It is proposed to involve the best representatives of the Ukrainian elite: patriotic politicians and public figures (opinion leaders), bloggers, volunteers, scientists, cultural and artistic figures for this case.
It is substantiated that state public policy subjects of counteracting disinformation and its dissemination (Center for Counteracting Disinformation of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security of the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine and National Council of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting) flows in the middle of the country, if necessary, applying the necessary remedial action, study the target audiences, identify, analyze and assess their vulnerabilities (public fears, doubts, etc.), predict possible information attacks on Ukraine. It is necessary to constantly cooperate with digital media and mass media through information and communication campaigns.
Practical recommendations were given to state/non-state subjects of counteraction of misinformation on struggle in Ukraine against production of fake content by means of social media. It is necessary:

to create a favorable socio-economic, institutional-legal and information-communicative environment for quality and independent journalism, as well as an independent community of fact-checkers as a form of journalistic control to verify the facts used in texts, speeches, social networks posts and identify possible inconsistencies;
to disseminate accurate, reliable and objective information on the basis of responsible and independent journalism, to prevent the dissemination of fabricated and manipulative content;
to produce positive Ukrainian narratives as a tool of information defense, to prevent the emergence of fakes (instead of refuting fakes - to act in advance), promptly and without explanation to remove/block malicious content in accordance with the law and ""community policy"";
to set requirements for the media platforms transparency (their activities, funding sources, owners), define criteria and algorithms for ranking information, as well as legally and legitimately require social media to remove illegal content and block its distributors;
to monitor, moderate and control the social media content on the basis of legality, transparency and compliance with international human rights standards with the use of means to protect them;
to regulate and control the distribution of advertising on news resources of the media and social media, in particular to ensure verification of the transparency and veracity of its sponsored political content, as well as limit of its targeting in order to minimize the income of disinformation disseminators;
to promote digital services of voluntary users identification in the online space;
to ensure easy, fast and reliable access to all official documents, regulated by the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, ratified by Ukraine in 2020 (Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents, 2009);
to delegate to search platforms and social networks to determine the truth/falsity of information using artificial intelligence algorithms, remembering that these algorithms can be used to detect/remove misinformation, and vice versa - to create fake information (for example, to form the necessary public opinion misinformation is directed to a specific target audience, taking into account its features and characteristics through algorithmic analysis of messages on social networks, preferences, a selection of sources of user content);

Approximately 80% of Americans do not meet minimum levels of recommended physical activity. Virtual reality (VR) may improve exercise outcomes by enhancing presence, decreasing perceived exertion, and increasing exercise enjoyment. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of a proprietary VR interface on presence, perceived exertion, and exercise enjoyment during rowing ergometry. METHODS: First, we developed a novel VR software program for rowing ergometry. Subsequently, sixteen apparently healthy, recreationally active individuals (12M, 4F; 35.5 ± 13.9 y; 174.5 ± 10.1 cm; 80.4 ± 12.8 kg; VO2max: 38.1 ± 5.6 mL/kg/min) were familiarized with the rowing ergometer and VR software, and then completed a VO2max test during two separate sessions. Finally, subjects performed four, 30-min rowing sessions in a randomized, counterbalanced order at maximal voluntary intensity in four different conditions: 1) no augmented visual or audio stimuli (CON), 2) no augmented visual stimuli with self-selected music (MUS), 3) screen-based environmental display (SB), and 4) a virtual reality environment (VR). Presence (Spatial Presence Experience Scale), perceived exertion (Borg 6-20 scale), and enjoyment (Exercise-Induced Feelings Inventory) were assessed using questionnaires. Data (mean ± SD) were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA and appropriate Tukey’s post hoc tests. Alpha was set at P \u3c 0.05. RESULTS: Eight of twenty spatial presence items indicated an enhanced experience in VR vs. SB (P \u3c 0.05). Perceived exertion (CON: 14.7 ± 2.1; MUS: 14.9 ± 2.0; SB: 15.2 ± 2.5; VR: 14.9 ± 1.7) and exercise-induced feelings were not different between conditions (P \u3e 0.05). CONCLUSION: The pilot version of the VR software for rowing ergometry did not reduce perceived exertion or increase exercise enjoyment in recreationally active individuals, although it did facilitate improved user presence compared to a screen-based enhanced environment. Added features, such as better coupling of rowing intensity to boat velocity in VR may further enhance presence and immersion, thereby decreasing perceived exertion and increasing exercise enjoyment",multimedia,122,not included

Sequence adaptive training offers further improvements depending on the precise variety employed but those improvements are of the order of ~10\% improvement in word accuracy.

“Once memories and dreams, the dead and ghosts become technologically reproducible.”

Friedrich Kittler (1999:11)



Black Mirror (2011-) is a science-fiction television series written by Charlie Brooker and first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK before moving to Netflix in 2016. The show takes an anthology approach, presenting each of its stories as a discrete episode commonly situated in dystopic, near-future settings. The series is orientated around three main themes; (1) the development, use and exploitation of technology, (2) the ethics related to the deployment of this technology by members of the public and corporations, and (3) an exploration of the nature of what constitutes consciousness specifically related to artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technology. It is the third of these themes that this paper addresses, considering how the series presents artificial intelligence as a philosophical discourse within which the implications of the impact of technology on society can be concentrated both in terms of its future and present day applications.



In the first episode of Season Two, Be Right Back (Harris, 2013) this is expressed in a story of the recently widowed Martha (Hayley Atwell), who reconstructs a version of her deceased husband Ash (Domhnall Gleeson) through a machine-based consciousness that draws upon the data created from his lifetime of publicly available digital activity. Initially, Martha’s interaction with Ash’s AI-self is confined to a text-based chat bot. “The more it has, the more it’s him,” states Martha’s friend Sarah, who initially sets up the account and advises that she had communicated with the same software after her own husband died to help mitigate her grief. This exchange prompts Martha to add Ash’s record of emails, still images, audio and video to the dataset that AI-Ash is able to draw upon, the creation of such information a real-world process that Jose Van Dijick and Thomas Poell have described as the “datafication” of a life mediated online (2013). 



Now able to communicate with her aurally, AI-Ash gathers more data from Martha as they converse on the phone and she recounts moments that she had spent with her late husband. Eventually, Martha buys a humanoid android clone and imprints upon it Ash’s likeness, allowing AI-Ash’s transition to physical manifestation and to whom Martha provides even more data to the cloud-based storage where AI-Ash’s consciousness is stored. “You look well,” Martha observes, as Android-Ash emerges from a bath of nutrient gel. “The photos we keep tend to be flattering,” the android replies, offering the first sense that this embodied self is already inauthentic – encumbered by what Joseph Walther describes as “hyperpersonal”, or extremely selective, representation of Ash’s self familiar to all users of social media platforms (2011). Despite Martha’s intentions in continuing life with a new version of her husband, Android-Ash lacks the imperfections that form part of her understanding of his humanness.



This theme of replicating human consciousness through artificial intelligence technologies is presented in a number of Black Mirror episodes, including White Christmas (Tibbetts, 2014), San Junipero (Harris, 2016), U.S.S. Callister (Haynes, 2017) and Black Museum (McCarthy, 2017). As in so much other science fiction, from Frankenstein (Shelley, 1818) to Ex Machina (Garland, 2015), the series uses this notion of questioning the use of the technology to recreate or feign consciousness in order to present a wider discourse around notions of identity, memory and the formulation of the human self and subjectivity.



The artificial intelligence of Be Right Back deviates from the notion of consciousness and identity of these other examples however. As AI-Ash’s consciousness is constructed from fragments of the singular human Ash’s online activity and Martha’s memories of their interactions, so the AI can only ever hope to represent an augmented reality that can only reflect the mediated nature of Ash’s incomplete digital self. This imperfect copy of the human Ash is a simulacrum, a likeness, unable to ever attain what Martin Heidegger describes as having “an openness-of-being” (1977: xxxv).



Despite the AI’s physical existence through the Android-Ash body, the machine intelligence does not meet the Heideggerian definition of “Dasein” (1977) - determined by being both present within the world and directly relating with it. Instead it is encumbered to constantly adding or adjusting the incomplete digital memory that constitutes AI-Ash. Initially hoping the cyborg will serve as a continuation of her husband, Martha soon becomes frustrated by her engagement with the Android/AI-Ash, realising that her creation is something very different and Other. She begins to understand that AI-Ash can only ever be a simulation or poor substitution of her late husband, as the data from which its consciousness is drawn is by forever destined to remain incomplete. “You are not enough of him”, she acknowledges. “You aren’t you […] just a few ripples of you. There’s no history to you. You’re just a performance of stuff that he did without thinking.”



As Ex Machina presented questions as the nature of machine consciousness, Be Right Back offers a more direct critique of the present, rather than the near future. Charlie Brooker’s presentation of the possibility of life after death through artificial intelligence technologies, proposes a more immediate philosophical question. What is the nature of the human self already disrupted by a second life through the engagement with social media and other online technologies? The relationship between AI-Ash and his human counterpart is perhaps closer than Martha realises, with the episode having presented the human Ash as being similarly augmented. He too is disconnected from his reality with Martha - distracted by the draw of his phone and virtual spaces, and subsequently less aware or responsive to his own, real surroundings than his AI simulacrum. As Jean Baudrillard argues, a hyperreality is a substitution of the real with the signs of the real. AI-Ash is, in Baudrillard’s terms, a simulation – “no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the generation of models of a real without origin or reality”. Brooker’s insight in this episode is not this representation of an inhuman simulacrum, but rather to comment critically on Ash’s social media present, as Baudrillard describes and as Martha despairs prior to her husband’s death, as “A hyperspace without atmosphere” (1983: 1-3).

Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE). 
Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following 10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a goal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops at designated points within the VRE. 
Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was 77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23), with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 +/- 1.0 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 +/- 53 sec completion time (perfect = 211 sec). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions. 
Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode users' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced control of ambulation after only a 10-minute training. The ability to achieve such BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of future BCI-lower extremity prosthesis systems may be feasible.",multimedia,132,not included

The need for innovation in this crime combat scene imposes partnerships, support, research and scientific method. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) and K-Means algorithms on real financial transaction databases investigated by Sergipe's LABLDs, comparing the evidences found with the results obtained by mapping the state-of-the-art published in the literature. Method: Initially, a Survey was conducted with the premise of characterizing the use of techniques of storage, integration, Data Mining and Data Analytics by LABLDs and other investigative units throughout Brazil. Then, a systematic mapping was performed as a way to identify and systematize the main approaches, techniques and algorithms used in computer science to combat LD. Finally, a controlled in vivo experiment was designed and executed to compare the EM and K-Means algorithms. Results: It was found that approximately 97% of survey respondents did not directly use any data mining algorithm and that 30.99% evaluated their own knowledge about the subject as bad or very bad. Related to the state of the art, it has been identified that the main approaches used against LD are supervised classifiers and clusters. With the execution of the experimental process, it was evidenced that the algorithm EM surpasses the K-means algorithm, reaching a maximum average accuracy of 98.25%. Conclusions: This thesis exposed a hard reality within the main investigation and control bodies of our country. After analyzing the state of the art, it was evidenced that there are opportunities to explore solutions against LD, especially in the areas of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Finally, the EM algorithm presented as a superior alternative to K-means for the implementation of a predictor module of suspicious transactions, confirming the results of the literature, however, in a real and specific investigation environment.Contexto: Desde 2007, por meio da Estratégia Nacional de Combate à Corrupção e à Lavagem de Dinheiro (ENCCLA), iniciou-se a criação dos primeiros Laboratórios de Tecnologia contra Lavagem de Dinheiro (LABLDs), os quais, hoje, estão presentes em todas as regiões da federação e são responsáveis por políticas de desenvolvimento de métodos e tecnologias de ponta para dar suporte aos órgãos de persecução penal. A necessidade de inovação neste cenário de combate ao crime impõe parcerias, apoio, pesquisas e método científicos. Objetivo: Este trabalho teve por proposito avaliar a eficácia dos algoritmos EM (Expectation–Maximization) e K-Means sobre bases de dados reais de transações financeiras investigadas pelos LABLDs de Sergipe, comparando as evidências encontradas com os resultados obtidos pelo mapeamento do estado da arte publicado na literatura. Método: Inicialmente, foi realizado um Survey com a premissa de caracterizar a utilização de técnicas de armazenamento, integração, Data Mining e Data Analytics pelos LABLDs e demais unidades investigativas em todo o Brasil. Em seguida, foi executado um mapeamento sistemático como forma de identificar e sistematizar as principais abordagens, técnicas e algoritmos usados na computação, para lutar contra a LD. Por fim, foi planejado e executado um experimento controlado, in vivo, para comparar os algoritmos EM e K-Means. Resultados: Constatou-se que aproximadamente 97% dos respondentes do survey não utilizavam diretamente algum algoritmo de mineração de dados e que 30,99% avaliavam o próprio conhecimento sobre o assunto como ruim ou péssimo. Para o estado da arte, foi identificado que as abordagens principais utilizadas contra LD são classificadores supervisionados e clusters. Com a execução do processo experimental, foi evidenciado que o algoritmo EM supera o algoritmo K-means, alcançando uma acurácia média máxima de 98,25%. Conclusões: Esta dissertação expôs a realidade dentro dos principais órgãos de investigação e controle do nosso país. Após ser analisado o estado da arte, evidenciou-se que há oportunidades para explorar soluções contra LD, principalmente nas áreas de Aprendizado de Máquina e Aprendizado Profundo. Finalmente, o algoritmo EM se apresentou como uma alternativa superior ao K-means, para a implementação de um módulo preditor de transações suspeitas, confirmando os resultados da literatura, todavia, em um ambiente real e específico de investigação.São Cristóvão, S",science,134,not included

Infatti, ora che povertà, disuguaglianze, degrado ambientale e umano hanno quasi compromesso la sopravvivenza della vita sulla Terra, la necessità di perseguire diversi paradigmi di sviluppo, produzione e consumo ha progressivamente catalizzato l’attenzione di un numero crescente di studiosi, professionisti e autorità di regolazione (nonchè della società in generale), per i quali la definizione di percorsi di cambiamento in grado di invertire le attuali tendenze globali è diventata una priorità di assoluto rilievo.
Nonostante i numerosi eventi internazionali recentemente avvenuti (primo fra tutti l’accordo sui Sustainable Development Goals da parte delle Nazioni Unite) abbiano consentito di aggiornare le priorità globali di sostenibilità alla luce dei mutati scenari mondiali, occorre sottolineare come, accanto alla definizione di nuovi obiettivi di sostenibilità, l’effettivo perseguimento delle sfide della sostenibilità debba passare attraverso un maggiore impegno verso la concreta attuazione di tali priorità da parte di tutti gli attori sociali.
Tra gli attori coinvolti nel processo di transizione verso la sostenibilità, le aziende rivestono certamente un ruolo di primo piano. Gli ultimi anni, infatti, hanno mostrato quanto possano essere devastanti gli effetti di comportamenti aziendali sconsiderati: frodi, violazioni delle norme in materia di lavoro e crescente inquinamento derivante dalle attività aziendali rappresentano solo alcuni degli eventi che hanno simboleggiato il fallimento del paradigma aziendale basato sulla massimizzazione del profitto nel creare società più giuste ed un ambiente naturale più salubre. Tale realtà ha interessato particolarmente le aziende operanti nel settore Agro-alimentare (dati sia il ruolo chiave rivestito dell’agricoltura nel contesto economico globale che le gravi conseguenze sui livelli di approvvigionamento alimentare causate dalle minacce ambientali derivanti dai paradigmi agricoli tradizionali e, più in generale, dalle attuali catene del valore Agro-alimentari) e, tra queste, le aziende multinazionali (data la severità degli impatti sociali e ambientali derivanti dal loro operato).
La crescente consapevolezza in merito all’insostenibilità delle attuali traiettorie di sviluppo aziendale ha pertanto portato sia aziendalisti che operatori a concentrarsi sulla ricerca di costrutti teorici che potessero sintetizzare la necessità per le aziende di abbracciare aspetti economici, sociali ed ambientali nei loro core business da un punto di vista integrato, con la conseguenza che molti concetti promuoventi l’adozione dei principi di sostenibilità a livello aziendale sono apparsi in letteratura nel corso degli anni. Tuttavia, la maggior parte di tali concetti è sembrata (e sembra tuttora) soffrire della mancanza di una visione integrata in merito alle diverse dimensioni della sostenibilità. E’ in questo contesto che il concetto di Corporate Sustainability, concepito come la massima espressione dell’integrazione tra le dimensioni di sostenibilità all'interno delle aziende, si è gradualmente affermato.
L’avvento della Corporate Sustainability, a sua volta, ha fatto emergere la necessità di cambiare progressivamente il modo in cui le aziende pensano a ciò che producono, a come producono ciò che esse producono, nonchè agli effetti che le loro attività hanno sulla società e l'ambiente, spingendo il mondo accademico a concentrarsi sul concetto di Modello di Business ed, in particolare, a mettere in discussione l’adeguatezza degli attuali Modelli di Business, accusati di non tenere debitamente in considerazione l’impatto degli aspetti sociali e ambientali sulla creazione di valore. In particolare, la necessità di concettualizzare Modelli di Business integranti al loro interno aspetti economici, sociali e ambientali ha fatto sì che il termine Modello di Business per la Sostenibilità si affermasse, non certo senza difficoltà. Il concetto di Modello di Business è infatti di per sé stato (ed è tuttora) oggetto di molteplici definizioni, che hanno portato ad un disaccordo generale su quale sia l’esatto significato del termine. Tale disaccordo si è successivamente spostato al concetto di Modello di Business per la Sostenibilità, come dimostrato dalle diverse concettualizzazioni attraverso i quali il termine è stato definito nel corso del tempo.
Il disaccordo esistente in merito a quale sia la definizione esatta del termine Modello di Business per la Sostenibilità non ha tuttavia indebolito la necessità di allontanarsi dalle attuali traiettorie di sviluppo aziendale per abbracciare un nuovo modo di pensare alle aziende, un modo secondo cui esse sono considerate come un elemento in grado di migliorare le condizioni sociali e ambientali mantenendo, allo stesso tempo, adeguati livelli di redditività. Al contrario, questo ha avuto importanti conseguenze in termini di ricerca: piuttosto che concentrarsi sull’elaborazione di specifiche e precise definizioni a priori di Modello di Business per la Sostenibilità, infatti, una parte della letteratura ha cominciato a concentrarsi sul processo di transizione dai Modelli di Business “tradizionali” ai Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità (con una particolare attenzione al ruolo svolto dall'innovazione), nonché sulle possibili tipologie di Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità che tale processo può originare. Inoltre, accanto alla necessità di mappare i principali cambiamenti per la sostenibilità all’interno dei Modelli di Business, è emerso il bisogno di allineare i Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità con le rispettive strategie, bisogno che ha dato origine ad un interessante filone di ricerca all’interno della Corporate Sustainability. Nonostante strategia e Modello di Business siano ormai considerati come due concetti distinti, infatti, è stata messa in luce una forte correlazione tra essi.
Una volta emersa l’importanza di allineare Modelli di Business e strategie di sostenibilità, è stata evidenziata la necessità di individuare quegli elementi in grado di favorire tale allineamento. In questo senso, la letteratura ha mostrato come i sistemi di Contabilità Direzionale e, in particolare, i Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione rivestano un ruolo chiave sia nella formulazione che nell’attuazione delle strategie di sostenibilità. Tuttavia, mentre il rapporto tra Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione e strategie di sostenibilità è stato ampiamente analizzato in letteratura (e importanti risultati di ricerca sono stati raggiunti in questo senso), il rapporto tra Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione e Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità risulta essere stato trascurato. Come sopra accennato, tuttavia, la stessa letteratura sembra essere concordare sempre più sul fatto che la corretta formulazione ed attuazione di strategie di sostenibilità debba essere accompagnata da modifiche coerenti nei Modelli di Business o, in altre parole, che i cambiamenti nelle strategie e nei Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità debbano essere allineati tra loro, soprattutto con riferimento al grado di incorporazione degli aspetti di sostenibilità. Pertanto, il ruolo che i Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione hanno nell’allineare strategie e Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità dovrebbe essere analizzato in maniera più approfondita.
Date tali premesse, il presente lavoro esplora il ruolo svolto dai Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione nell’allineare strategie e Modelli di Business per la Sostenibilità, attraverso un caso di studio su Barilla, multinazionale italiana operante nel settore Agro-alimentare. Dopo una breve introduzione sugli obiettivi e le motivazioni sottostanti alla ricerca (Capitolo 1), in particolare, l’elaborato offre una panoramica sullo sviluppo storico del concetto di sostenibilità (capitolo 2), per poi esplorare l'evoluzione del concetto di Corporate Sustainability (Capitolo 3) e successivamente analizzare il concetto di Modello di Business per la Sostenibilità, mettendo altresì in evidenza i suoi rapporti con quello di strategia di sostenibilità (Capitolo 4). Dopo aver fornito una panoramica sui temi della Contabilità Direzionale e del Controllo di Gestione per la sostenibilità (capitolo 5), l’elaborato illustra la metodologia (interpretativa) e il metodo (caso di studio) impiegati nel presente lavoro (Capitolo 6), per poi presentare il caso di studio Barilla, ed infine proporre alcune osservazioni conclusive, evidenziando i contributi principali e le limitazioni dello studio (capitolo 7).
Dal punto di vista del contributo scientifico, il lavoro mostra come, nel caso di studio ha analizzato, anche se il Sistema di Controllo di Gestione ha contribuito all'allineamento tra Modello di Business e strategia di sostenibilità, l’entità di tale contributo è stata limitata dalla carenza di integrazione tra strumenti di controllo “tradizionali” e strumenti orientati alla sostenibilità (cioè specificamente progettati per monitorare gli aspetti di sostenibilità). Pertanto, in questo senso il lavoro mira a contribuire a quel filone di ricerca sul tema del Controllo di Gestione che suggerisce come, al fine di perseguire efficacemente la sostenibilità, i Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione debbano evolversi, attraverso una migliore integrazione fra aspetti economici, ambientali e sociali, nonché evidenziando e misurando in modo più chiaro i trade-offs (tipici del concetto di Corporate Sustainability) spesso esistenti tra questi aspetti.
Come noto, l'adozione di un approccio qualitativo non consente di ottenere risultati statisticamente generalizzabili, poiché il suo scopo principale è quello di descrivere in dettaglio ed interpretare fenomeni sociali, senza fornire tuttavia modelli predittivi ed esplicativi. Inoltre, i risultati dello studio potrebbero essere influenzati dalla definizione di Modello di Business scelta. Come ampiamente illustrato nel lavoro, infatti, sono molte le definizioni di Modello di Business presenti in letteratura, e anche se la definizione di Modello di Business scelta è considerata “robusta” dalla letteratura, la scelta di una diversa definizione potrebbe portare a risultati diversi. Occorre tuttavia sottolineare come sia la stessa letteratura a suggerire, data l’eterogeneità nelle definizioni di Modello di Business, di scegliere la definizione più adatta a rispondere alla domanda di ricerca. In questo senso, si segnala come ulteriori analisi potrebbero esplorare il ruolo dei Sistemi di Controllo di Gestione nell’allineare Modelli di Business e strategie di sostenibilità in altre aziende, anche operanti in settori differenti, consentendo di confrontare i risultati emergenti dai vari casi di studio ed eventualmente rafforzare le evidenze fornite dal caso di studio oggetto del presente lavoro.
There is little doubt that sustainability represents one the greatest imperatives of the 21st century. In fact, now that poverty, inequality, environmental and human degradation have almost compromised the survival of life on Earth, the need to pursue different paradigms of development, production and consumption have progressively catalyzed the attention of a growing number of academics, practitioners and regulators (as well as society as a whole), to whom the definition of pathways of change able to reverse current global trends has become an absolute priority.
Despite several international events that have recently taken place (first of all the agreement on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) made possible to update global sustainability priorities in the light of changed scenarios, it must be underlined that, alongside the definition of new sustainability goals, the effective tackling of sustainability challenges should pass through a greater commitment to the concrete implementation of such priorities by all societal actors.
Among the actors involved in the process of transition towards sustainability, companies certainly play a prominent role. Recent years, in fact, have shown how devastating the effects of reckless corporate behavior can be: frauds, breach of work regulations, as well as increasing pollution caused by corporate activities represent just some of the events that symbolized the failure of profit maximization-oriented paradigm in creating fairer societies and healthier natural environment. Such reality has particularly affected companies operating in the Agri-food sector (given both the key role played by agriculture in the global economic scenario and the serious consequences on food supply levels caused by environmental threats deriving from traditional agricultural paradigms and, more generally, from current Agri-food value chains) and, among these, multinational companies (given the severity of social and environmental impacts deriving from their operate).
Growing awareness of unsustainability of Business-As-Usual trajectories led both business academics and practitioners to focus their efforts on the research of theoretical constructs that could synthetize the need for companies to embrace economic, social and environmental issues in their core business from an integrated standpoint, with the consequence that many concepts promoting the adoption of sustainability principles at company level appeared in literature over the years. However, the majority of such concepts seemed (and seems) to suffer of a lack of an integrated view about different sustainability dimensions. It is moving from this context that the concept of Corporate Sustainability, as the fullest expression of the integration between sustainability dimensions within companies, gradually established itself.
The advent of Corporate Sustainability, in turn, made emerge the need for a progressive change in the way in which companies think about what they produce, how they produce what they produce, as well as about the effects that their activities have on society and environment, leading scholarly efforts to focus on the concept of Business Model and, in particular, to question the adequacy of the existing Business Models, accused to do not take into consideration the impact of social and environmental aspects in the creation of value appropriately. In particular, the need to conceptualize Business Models in which social and environmental aspects are fully integrated with economic ones made emerge the term Business Model for Sustainability, certainly not without difficulties. The concept of Business Model per se has in fact been subject to multiple definitions over time, leading to a general disagreement about its exact meaning. Such disagreement has then subsequently shifted to the concept of Business Model for Sustainability, as showed by several conceptualizations through which the term has been defined over time.
Disagreement over the exact definition of Business Model for Sustainability, however, have not weakened the need to move away from Business-As-Usual trajectories in order to embrace a new way of thinking about companies, a way according to which companies are considered as a factor able to improve societal and environmental conditions keeping, at the same time, adequate profitability levels. On the contrary, this had important consequence in terms of research: rather than focusing on the elaboration of specific and precise a priori definitions of Business Model for Sustainability, in fact, an always more consistent part of the literature has begun to focus on the process of transition from “traditional” Business Models to Business Models for Sustainability (with a particular emphasis on the role played by innovation), as well as on possible typologies of Business Models for Sustainability that this process could originate. Moreover, alongside the need to map main changes towards sustainability in Business Models, the need to align Business Models for Sustainability with sustainability strategies emerged, originating an interesting field of research within Corporate Sustainability area. Despite strategy and Business Model are now considered as two distinct concepts, in fact, a close relationship between them has been highlighted by several authors.
Once the importance of aligning Business Model and strategy for sustainability has been highlighted, the need to individuate the elements that can favor such alignment emerged. In this sense, literature has showed that Management Accounting and, above all, Management Control Systems can play a key role both in formulation and implementation of sustainability strategies. Nevertheless, while the relationship between Management Control Systems and sustainability strategies has been extensively explored (and important research results have been achieved in this sense), the relationship between Management Control Systems and Business Models for Sustainability seems to be underexplored in literature. As above mentioned, however, the same literature seems to increasingly agree on the fact that the appropriate formulation and implementation of sustainability strategies should be accompanied by consistent changes in the Business Models or, in other words, changes in strategies and Business Models for Sustainability should be aligned between them, especially in terms of the degree of incorporation of sustainability issues. Therefore, the analysis of the role that Management Control Systems have in the implementation of Business Models for Sustainability and, above all, that of the role that Management Control Systems have in aligning strategies and Business Models for Sustainability should be analysed in more detail.
Given this premise, this work explores the role played by Management Control Systems in aligning sustainability strategies and Business Models for Sustainability. To do this, a case study on Barilla, an Italian multinational company operating in Agri-food sector, has been conducted. After a brief introduction to the objectives and motivations for the research (Chapter 1), in particular, the work provides an overview on the historical development of sustainability concept (Chapter 2), to then explore the evolution of the concept of Corporate Sustainability (Chapter 3) and analyse the concept of Business Model for Sustainability, highlighting its relationships with that of sustainability strategy (Chapter 4). Subsequently, after having provided an overview on Management Accounting and Control for sustainability (Chapter 5), methodology (interpretive) and method (case study) employed in the present work are illustrated (Chapter 6). Finally, after having presented the case study on Barilla, some concluding remarks are provided, and main contributions and limitations of the study are highlighted (Chapter 7).
In terms of scientific contributions, the work shows that, in the case study analysed, although the Management Control System contributed to the alignment between Business Model and sustainability strategy, the magnitude of such contribution was limited by the lack of integration between “traditional” management control tools and sustainability-oriented ones (specifically designed to monitor aspects of sustainability). Therefore, in this sense the work aims at contributing to that stream of Management Control research suggesting that, in order to effectively pursue sustainability, Management Control Systems must evolve, by better integrating economic, environmental and social aspects between them, as well as by highlighting and measuring trade-offs (typical of Corporate Sustainability concept) often existing between these aspects in a clearer way.
As known, the adoption of a qualitative approach does not allow to obtain statistically-generalizable results, since main aim of such approach is that of describing in detail, understanding and interpreting social phenomena without providing, however, predictive or explanatory models. Moreover, results of the study may be affected by the definition of Business Model chosen. As widely illustrated in the work, in fact, there are many definitions of Business Model in literature, and even if the definition of Business Model selected is considered a “robust” one, choosing a different definition could lead to different results. However, it must be underlined that is the same literature to suggest, given the heterogeneity in existing definitions, to choose the most suitable definition of Business Model to answer the research question. In this sense, further analyses could explore the role of Management Control Systems in aligning Business Models for Sustainability and sustainability strategies in other companies, also operating in different sectors, allowing to compare results emerging from various case studies, and eventually strengthening evidence provided by the case study object of the present work",science,135,not included

,to_check,core,,,core,matter and memory and deep learning,,"The recent phenomenon of ‘Deep Learning,’ which has given us such science-fiction-like innovations as search tools in photographic applications and the growing reality of self-driving cars, is a new form, and subset, of ‘Machine Learning’ made possible by very recent innovations in computing.   Machine Learning itself has been around for some decades – essentially pattern-recognition software that requires very substantial computing resources, which were, until very recently, mostly theoretical and hard to come by.  Machine Learning was one avenue of the field of Artificial Intelligence known as Narrow A.I. – the kind of ‘artificial intelligence’ that was strictly limited in scope as a first-steps starting point of what came, as a result, to be known as General A.I.  General A.I., known then as simply, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, was the 1950s dream that brought us such things as Robbie the Robot, and more recently C3PO, and The Terminator: the kind of science fiction characters that remain the only manifestations of General Artificial Intelligence.



‘Deep Learning’ also continues engineering’s 1940s trend of using language in a way that I will contest in this paper: a co-opting of words that have been used, in the past, to describe human activities, using them instead to describe what engineers have managed to make machines do.  These co-optations reduce the richness of the word, making its referent an algorithm: a flow diagram that represents the bare essentials of what an engineer can understand and reproduce of a human activity; not the human activity itself.  This diagram of the ‘engineering possible’ over-simplifies the human activity it tries to depict.   With continued usage, the meaning of the word for us today has all-too-often become reduced to what the engineer has newly defined it to mean: something much less than it once was.  



In this paper I propose to attempt to roll back some of these co-optations, and to re-introduce some of the richness of the words that have been taken by engineering.  I shall examine Turing’s seminal paper on the notion of a thinking machine.  I shall be using the philosophical insights of Henri Bergson, especially in his book, Matter and Memory, and the discoveries of neuroscience and complexity scientists. I will try to show that the answer to Turing’s question, ‘Can machines think?’ remains a resounding, ‘No!’, and that notions such as ‘deep learning’ are in fact not only an inaccurate use of the very human experience of learning, but degrade the latter in using such a term",robotics,137,not included

However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI).

Moreover, it is very tough to tune the parameters of reward mechanism since the driving styles vary a lot among the different users. For instance, an aggressive driver may prefer driving with high acceleration whereas some conservative drivers prefer a safer driving style. Therefore, we propose an apprenticeship learning in combination with deep reinforcement learning approach that allows the agent to learn the driving and stopping behaviors with continuous actions. We use gradient inverse reinforcement learning (GIRL) algorithm to recover the unknown reward function and employ REINFORCE as well as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to learn the optimal policy.

In this work, we build on these failure detection systems and develop a pipeline that learns to identify the correct trajectory to execute that restores the vision system and the unmanned vehicle to a safe state. The key challenge with using a deep learning pipeline for this problem is the limited amount of training data available from a real world system.

Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the water-logged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect.

In general, these services are computationally expensive, especially for the machine learning based applications (e.g., CNN-based object detection). Nevertheless, the on-board computation unit possess limited compute resources, raising a huge challenge to deploy these computation-intensive services on the vehicle. On the contrary, the cloud-based architecture conceptually with unconstrained resources suffers from unexpected extended latency that attributes to the large-scale Internet data transmission; thus, adversely affecting the services' real-time performance, quality of services and user experiences. To address this dilemma, inspired by the promising edge computing paradigm, we propose to build an Open Vehicular Data Analytics Platform (OpenVDAP) for CAVs, which is a full-stack edge based platform including an on-board computing/communication unit, an isolation-supported and security & privacy-preserved vehicle operation system, an edge-aware application library, as well as an optimal workload of?oading and scheduling strategy, allowing CAVs to dynamically detect each service's status, computation overhead and the optimal of?oading destination so that each service could be finished within an acceptable latency and limited bandwidth consumption.

In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR simulator that augments real point cloud with synthetic obstacles (e.g., cars, pedestrians, and other movable objects). Unlike previous simulators that entirely rely on CG models and game engines, our augmented simulator bypasses the requirement to create high-fidelity background CAD models. Instead, we can simply deploy a vehicle with a LiDAR scanner to sweep the street of interests to obtain the background point cloud, based on which annotated point cloud can be automatically generated. This unique ""scan-and-simulate"" capability makes our approach scalable and practical, ready for large-scale industrial applications. In this paper, we describe our simulator in detail, in particular the placement of obstacles that is critical for performance enhancement.

The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones.

With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system.

This paper proposes the fusion of neural networks, fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms, with the aim to strengthen the modeling power for epidemiological dynamics. We deploy an additive fuzzy system into a neural network architecture in order to incorporate recurrent nodes to enable the fuzzy system to handle temporal data. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the fuzzy rule structure before supervised training is applied to adjust parameters. As epidemiological time series exhibit complex behavior and possibly cyclic patterns, the addition of recurrent nodes to the fuzzy system improves the modeling capability.

Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",health,211,not included

The algorithms that were investigated for this paper are based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), measures of variance, linear predictive coding, and measurement of approximate entropy (AE). Based on the results from the test data set, the HMM algorithm performed best for this application. In general, there is little difference between the performance of the HMM and AE algorithms. However, the implementation of the HMM algorithm is more computationally efficient. Because of the large amount of data that must be analyzed in ambulatory ECG recordings, the computational efficiency must be considered as an issue of practicality. Review of the data illuminated some of the strengths and weaknesses of the various algorithms. Variance measures performed with either high sensitivity or high positive predictivity, but were not able to achieve a desirable operating point that had both acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity. Although AE and LPC had acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity, the HMM performed even better than both of these in terms of overall error rate. It would seem that an observational model such as the HMM, fits the data better than parametric models such as AE and LPC.

At the same time, US recreational boaters already are burdened with high numbers of fatal and injurious accidents, and are being encouraged to navigate using Internet-based APPs that require texting. Our analyses of trends in recent US Coast Guard's (USCG's) Boating Statistics<sup>1</sup> seem to support that accidents due to inattention are on the rise. Specifically, owner/operator inattention is causing a higher number of collisions with other recreational boats and these are accompanied by a related rise in fatalities per collision. This observation is in-line with the US Dept. of Transportation findings that texting while driving leads to more violent accidents; therefore, more fatalities/accident. Review of recent years of USCG Boating Statistics (2004 thru 2012, subsequent to the beginning of the fuel crisis) yielded several interesting conclusions. Using data 2012 as a benchmark, there were 4,515 recreational boating accidents resulting in 651 fatalities. In 73% of these fatal accidents, the owner/operators had no USCG approved instruction. Also alarming, in 13% of the 4515 accidents the cause was owner/operator inattention. Add to this, in 1010 accidents of the 4,515, these involved a collision with another recreational boat! (That's over 22% of the total accidents). It's shocking to realize that the number of moms, dads, young men and women and children that are dying and seriously injured per year, while enjoying this recreational activity, was nearly equaled the yearly US troop losses and serious injuries during the Iraq war.

This technique has been supporting pathologists in making precise decisions regarding differential diagnosis and subtyping, and in creating personalized treatment plans. However, the interpretation of IHC results presents challenges in complicated cases. Furthermore, rapidly increasing amounts of IHC data are making it even harder for pathologists to reach to definitive conclusions. Methods We developed ImmunoGenius, a machine-learning-based expert system for the pathologist, to support the diagnosis of tumors of unknown origin. Based on Bayesian theorem, the most probable diagnoses can be drawn by calculating the probabilities of the IHC results in each disease. We prepared IHC profile data of 584 antibodies in 2009 neoplasms based on the relevant textbooks. We developed the reactive native mobile application for iOS and Android platform that can provide 10 most possible differential diagnoses based on the IHC input.

Machine learning analyses of large-scale MRI data are pivotal in advancing the diagnosis, management and improve outcomes in neuro-oncology. A common challenge to robust machine learning approaches is the lack of large ‘ground truth’ datasets in supervised learning for building classification and prediction models. The creation of these datasets relies on human-expert input and is time-consuming and subjective error-prone, limiting effective machine learning applications. Simulation of mechanistic aspects such as geometry, location and physical properties of brain tumours can generate large-scale ground-truth datasets allowing for comparison of analysis techniques in clinical applications. We aimed to develop a transparent and convenient method for building ‘ground truth’ presentations of simulated glioma lesions on anatomical MRI.
               
                  Materials/methods
                  The simulation workflow was created using the Feature Manipulation Engine (FME®), a data integration platform specializing in the spatial data processing. By compiling and integrating FME’s functions to read, integrate, transform, validate, save, and display MRI data, and experimenting with ways to manipulate the parameters concerning location, size, shape, and signal intensity with the presentations of glioma, we were able to generate simulated appearances of high-grade gliomas on gadolinium-based high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI (1 mm3). Data of patients with canonical high-grade tumours were used as real-world tumours for validating the accuracy of the simulation. Twenty raters who are experienced with brain tumour interpretation on MRI independently completed a survey, designed to distinguish simulated and real-world brain tumours. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for assessing the performance of the approach with the binary classification of simulated vs real-world tumours. Correlation and regression were used in run time analysis, assessing the software toolset’s efficiency in producing different numbers of simulated lesions. Differences in the group means were examined using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test.
               
                  Results
                  The simulation method was developed as an interpretable and useful workflow for the easy creation of tumour simulations and incorporation into 3D MRI. A linear increase in the running time and memory usage was observed with an increasing number of generated lesions. The respondents' accuracy rate ranged between 33.3 and 83.3 %. The sensitivity and specificity were low for a human expert to differentiate simulated lesions from real gliomas (0.43 and 0.58) or vice versa (0.65 and 0.62). The mean scores ranking the real-world gliomas did not differ between the simulated and real tumours.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The reliable and user-friendly software method can allow for robust simulation of high-grade glioma on MRI. Ongoing research efforts include optimizing the workflow for generating glioma datasets as well as adapting it to simulating additional MRI brain changes.",health,252,not included

Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much smaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. Different from the popular approach of simultaneously training encoder and decoder using neural network models, the CS theory ensures a high probability of accurate signal reconstruction based on random measurements that is shorter than the length of the original signal under a sparsity constraint. Such method is particularly useful when measurements are expensive, such as wireless sensing of civil structures, because its hardware implementation allows down sampling of signals during the sensing process. Hence, CS methods can achieve significant energy saving for the sensing devices. However, the strong assumption of the signals being highly sparse in an invertible space is relatively hard to guarantee for many real images, such as image of cracks. In this paper, we present a new approach of CS that replaces the sparsity regularization with a generative model that is able to effectively capture a low dimension representation of targeted images. We develop a recovery framework for automatic crack segmentation of compressed crack images based on this new CS method. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of our method that takes advantage of the strong capability of generative models to capture the necessary features required in the crack segmentation task even the backgrounds of the generated images are not well reconstructed. The superior performance of our recovery framework is illustrated by comparisons to three existing CS algorithms. Furthermore, we show that our framework is potentially extensible to other common problems in automatic crack segmentation, such as defect recovery from motion blurring and occlusion.",health,253,not included

There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment.

We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time.

                  Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) have brought several breakthroughs to biomedical image analysis by making available more consistent and robust tools for the identification, classification, reconstruction, denoising, quantification, and segmentation of patterns in biomedical images. Recently, some applications of DL and ML in Computed Tomography (CT) scans for low dose optimization were developed. Nowadays, DL algorithms are used in CT to perform replacement of missing data (processing technique) such as low dose to high dose, sparse view to full view, low resolution to high resolution, and limited angle to full angle. Thus, DL comes with a new vision to process biomedical data imagery from CT scan. It becomes important to develop architectures and/or methods based on DL algorithms for minimizing radiation during a CT scan exam thanks to reconstruction and processing techniques.

We based our study on the literature and proposed a pipeline for low dose CT scan image reconstruction. Our proposed pipeline relies on DL and the Spark Framework using MapReduce programming. We discuss our proposed pipeline with those proposed in the literature to conclude the efficiency and importance.

Traditional CAD systems in mammography screening have followed a rules-based approach, incorporating domain knowledge into hand-crafted features before using classical machine learning techniques as a classifier. The first commercial CAD system, ImageChecker M1000, relies on computer vision techniques for pattern recognition. Unfortunately, CAD systems have been shown to adversely affect some radiologists' performance and increase recall rates. The Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge was a multidisciplinary collaboration that provided 640,000 mammography images for teams to help decrease false-positive rates in breast cancer screening. Winning solutions leveraged deep learning's (DL) automatic hierarchical feature learning capabilities and used convolutional neural networks.

                  Drug safety researchers seek to know the degree of certainty with which a particular drug is associated with an adverse drug reaction. There are different sources of information used in pharmacovigilance to identify, evaluate, and disseminate medical product safety evidence including spontaneous reports, published peer-reviewed literature, and product labels. Automated data processing and classification using these evidence sources can greatly reduce the manual curation currently required to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls (i.e. drugs that cause adverse drug events and those that do not) to be used in drug safety research.
               
                  Methods
                  In this paper we explore a method for automatically aggregating disparate sources of information together into a single repository, developing a predictive model to classify drug-adverse event relationships, and applying those predictions to a real world problem of identifying negative controls for statistical method calibration.
               
                  Results
                  Our results showed high predictive accuracy for the models combining all available evidence, with an area under the receiver-operator curve of ⩾0.92 when tested on three manually generated lists of drugs and conditions that are known to either have or not have an association with an adverse drug event.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Results from a pilot implementation of the method suggests that it is feasible to develop a scalable alternative to the time-and-resource-intensive, manual curation exercise previously applied to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls to be used in drug safety research.",health,267,not included

More precisely, prognostics of PEMFC is major area of focus nowadays, which aims at identifying degradation of PEMFC stack at early stages and estimating its Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. This paper presents a data-driven approach for prognostics of PEMFC stack using an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet- Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) models. This development aim at improving the robustness and applicability of prognostics of PEMFC for an online application, with limited learning data.

                  A programme proposal for competency-based Neurosurgery training adapted to the specialization project is presented. This proposal has been developed by a group of neurosurgeons commissioned by the SENEC (Spanish Society of Neurosurgery) and could be modified to generate a final version that could come into force coinciding with the implementation of the specialization programme. This document aims to facilitate the test of the new programme included in the online version of our journal.
               
                  Duration of the programme
                  Total training period is 6 years; initial 2 years belong to the surgery specialization and remaining 4 years belong to core specialty period.
               
                  Structure of the programme
                  It is a competency-based programmed based on the map used by the US Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) including the following domains of clinical competency: Medical knowledge, patient care, communication skills, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, health systems, interprofessional collaboration and professional and personal development. Subcompetencies map in the domains of Knowledge and Patient care (including surgical competencies) was adapted to the one proposed by AANS and CNS (annex 1 of the programme). A subcompetency map was also used for the specialization rotations.
               
                  Instruction methods
                  Resident's training is based on personal study (self-learning) supported by efficient use of information sources and supervised clinical practice, including bioethical instruction, clinical management, research and learning techniques.
               
                  Evaluation methods

Several approaches have been proposed for identifying one or more faults treated in an isolated way.

This work introduces a novel methodology that merges singular value decomposition, statistical analysis, and artificial neural networks for multiple combined fault identification. Obtained results demonstrate its high effectiveness on detecting faulty bearings, unbalance, broken rotor bars, and all their possible combinations. The developed field programmable gate array-based implementation offers a portable low-cost solution for online classification of the rotating machine condition in real time. Thanks to its generalized nature, the introduced approach can be extended for detecting multiple combined faults under different working conditions by a proper calibration.",health,270,not included

During an image-guided neurosurgery, path planning remains the foremost and hence the most important step to perform an operation and ensures the maximum resection of an intended target and minimum sacrifice of health tissues. In this investigation, the technique of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) coupled with machine learning algorithms are exploited in designing a computer aided path planning system (CAP) to assist junior doctors in planning surgical paths while sustaining the highest precision. Specifically, after evaluation of approaches of sparse coding and K-means in constructing a codebook, the model of sparse codes of 3D SIFT has been furthered and thereafter employed for retrieving, The novelty of this work lies in the fact that not only the existing algorithms for 2D images have been successfully extended into 3D space, leading to promising results, but also the application of CBIR that is mainly in a research realm, to a clinical sector can be achieved by the integration with machine learning techniques. Comparison with the other four popular existing methods is also conducted, which demonstrates that with the implementation of sparse coding, all methods give better retrieval results than without while constituting the codebook, implying the significant contribution of machine learning techniques.",health,272,not included

The method has a high success rate, approximately 97%. Unlike analytical methods based on geometric descriptions of the object sought, the method proposed here can cover a large area of shape variation of the artery under study, which normally occurs during examinations as a result of the pressure on the examined tissue, tilt of the probe, setup of the sonographic device, and other factors. This method shows great promise in automating the process of determining circulatory system parameters in the non-invasive clinical diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases. The method employs a Viola-Jones detector that has been specially adapted for efficient detection of transverse sections of the carotid artery. This algorithm is trained on a set of labeled images using the AdaBoost algorithm, Haar-like features and the Matthews coefficient. The training algorithm of the artery detector was modified using evolutionary algorithms. The method for training a cascade of classifiers achieves on a small number of positive and negative training data samples (about 500 images) a high success rate in a computational time that allows implementation of the detector in real time. Testing was performed on images of different patients for whom different ultrasonic instruments were used under different conditions (settings) so that the algorithm developed is applicable in general radiologic practice.",health,273,not included

                  In Taiwan, the classification of real problems of children with appropriate occupational therapy is a difficult job for the therapist. The complexities of 127 attribute values to be evaluated in the assessment, the misleading diagnosis which may be made by the pediatrician and the shortage of manpower cause of high workload for the therapist. The design of an easy to use and effective classification model is therefore an important issue in children’s occupational therapy treatment. This study accordingly applies an artificial neural network (ANN) and classification and regression tree (CART) techniques to skeleton an intelligent classification model in order to provide a comprehensive framework to assist the therapist to raise the accuracy when categorizing children’s problems for occupational therapy. These categories with critical attributes under the guidelines of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) are discussed, in order to assist the therapist for precise assessment and appropriate treatment. To the best of our knowledge, no research has yet been conducted on the problems’ characteristics in children’s occupational therapy.
               
                  Methods
                  Based on the advice and assistance of the therapists and occupational therapy treatment needed, 127 outpatients from a regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2010 were selected as the data sets for problems in children occupation classification. This study accordingly suggests an intelligent model for the classification which integrates ANN and CART. The major steps in applying the model include: (1) building an ANN higher performance trained model; and (2) adopting CART to the trained model and building in previous steps, to extract the critical attributes of children occupational problems.
               
                  Results
                  The results showed that artificial neural network had a higher accuracy, up to 84%, with evenly distributed datasets. Then high performance of the trained neural network had been extracted for the rules by using the classification tree approach in the classification and regression trees application. Most important of all, this study indicated that some of the rules can correctly identify up to 67% of the problems of the children with 100% confidence, which is much better than the current evaluations being used. Moreover, the tree with a binary variable of age and 8 predicators were found and listed afterward, such as, gross coordination, upper left muscle tone, interpersonal skill, proprioceptive and vestibular, visual, visual stimulus input for influence of emotional and movement, swallowing, and dressing. Actual implementation showed that the intelligent classification model is capable of integrating ANN and CART techniques to clarify children’s occupational therapy problems with considerable accuracy.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The model could be employed as a supporting system in making decisions regarding children problems with occupational therapy classifications and treatment. The rules extracted from CART were helpful to therapists in classifying what category the real problems of the children belonged to. This study expected that more machine learning techniques will certainly play an essential role in future children occupational therapy applications.",health,274,not included

                  Information Technologies and Knowledge-based Systems can significantly improve the management of complex distributed health systems, where supporting multidisciplinarity is crucial and communication and synchronization between the different professionals and tasks becomes essential. This work proposes the use of the ontological paradigm to describe the organizational knowledge of such complex healthcare institutions as a basis to support their management. The ontology engineering process is detailed, as well as the way to maintain the ontology updated in front of changes. The paper also analyzes how such an ontology can be exploited in a real healthcare application and the role of the ontology in the customization of the system. The particular case of senior Home Care assistance is addressed, as this is a highly distributed field as well as a strategic goal in an ageing Europe.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  The proposed ontology design is based on a Home Care medical model defined by an European consortium of Home Care professionals, framed in the scope of the K4Care European project (FP6). Due to the complexity of the model and the knowledge gap existing between the – textual – medical model and the strict formalization of an ontology, an ontology engineering methodology (On-To-Knowledge) has been followed.
               
                  Results
                  After applying the On-To-Knowledge steps, the following results were obtained: the feasibility study concluded that the ontological paradigm and the expressiveness of modern ontology languages were enough to describe the required medical knowledge; after the kick-off and refinement stages, a complete and non-ambiguous definition of the Home Care model, including its main components and interrelations, was obtained; the formalization stage expressed HC medical entities in the form of ontological classes, which are interrelated by means of hierarchies, properties and semantically rich class restrictions; the evaluation, carried out by exploiting the ontology into a knowledge-driven e-health application running on a real scenario, showed that the ontology design and its exploitation brought several benefits with regards to flexibility, adaptability and work efficiency from the end-user point of view; for the maintenance stage, two software tools are presented, aimed to address the incorporation and modification of healthcare units and the personalization of ontological profiles.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The paper shows that the ontological paradigm and the expressiveness of modern ontology languages can be exploited not only to represent terminology in a non-ambiguous way, but also to formalize the interrelations and organizational structures involved in a real and distributed healthcare environment. This kind of ontologies facilitates the adaptation in front of changes in the healthcare organization or Care Units, supports the creation of profile-based interaction models in a transparent and seamless way, and increases the reusability and generality of the developed software components. As a conclusion of the exploitation of the developed ontology in a real medical scenario, we can say that an ontology formalizing organizational interrelations is a key component for building effective distributed knowledge-driven e-health systems.",health,276,not included

To that end, we detail a modern one, the LANL reduced gradient bubble model (RGBM), dynamical principles, and correlations with the LANL Data Bank data. Table, profile, and meter fit and risk parameters are obtained in statistical likelihood analysis from decompression exposure data. The RGBM algorithm enjoys extensive and utilitarian application in mixed gas diving, both in recreational and technical sectors, and forms the bases for released tables, software, and decompression meters used by scientific, commercial, and research divers. The LANL Data Bank is described, and the methods used to deduce risk are detailed. Risk functions for dissolved gas and bubbles are summarized. Parameters that can be used to estimate profile risk are tallied. To fit data, a modified Levenberg–Marquardt routine is employed. The LANL Data Bank presently contains 2879 profiles with 20 cases of DCS across nitrox, trimix, and heliox deep and decompression diving. This work establishes needed correlation between global mixed gas diving, specific bubble model, and deep stop data. Our objective is operational diving, not clinical science. The fit of bubble model to deep stop data is chi squared significant to 93%, using the logarithmic likelihood ratio of null set (actual set) to fit set.

Completed datasets are preferred for a number of analysis methods, and successful imputation of missing EHR data can improve interpretation and increase our power to predict health outcomes. However, use of the most popular imputation methods mainly require scripting skills, and are implemented using various packages and syntax. Thus, the implementation of a full suite of methods is generally out of reach to all except experienced data scientists. Moreover, imputation is often considered as a separate exercise from exploratory data analysis, but should be considered as art of the data exploration process. We have created a new graphical tool, ImputEHR, that is based on a Python base and allows implementation of a range of simple and sophisticated (e.g., gradient-boosted tree-based and neural network) data imputation approaches. In addition to imputation, the tool enables data exploration for informed decision-making, as well as implementing machine learning prediction tools for response data selected by the user.

A major problem for health authorities is that we do not know. In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative. Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity. As Bluetooth transmission is the most likely method used for such inter-device communication, and as our suggested ""virtual viruses"" do not harm individuals' software or intrude on privacy, we call these Safe Blues. In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals' locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages: - Data about the spread of Safe Blues is uploaded to a central server in real time, which can give authorities a more up-to-date picture in comparison to actual COVID-19 data, which is only available retrospectively. - Sampling of Safe Blues data is not biased by being applied only to people who have shown symptoms or who have come into contact with known positive cases. These features mean that there would be real statistical value in introducing Safe Blues. In the medium term and end game of COVID-19, information from Safe Blues could aid health authorities to make informed decisions with respect to social distancing and other measures. In this paper we outline the general principles of Safe Blues and we illustrate how Safe Blues data together with neural networks may be used to infer characteristics of the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

At the same time, many challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends by making use of continuous crowdsourced labeling of public social media content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow from data collection, filtering, labeling and training of machine learning classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the public health domain. This work describes the technical aspects of the platform, thereby covering the functionalities at its current state and exploring its future use cases and extensions",health,281,included

There are several Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions that rely on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, Deep Learning (DL) have been included for its high potential to improve accuracy on fall detection. Also, the use of fog devices for the ML inference (detecting falls) spares cloud drawback of high network latency, non-appropriate for delay-sensitive applications such as fall detectors. Though, current fall detection systems lack DL inference on the fog, and there is no evidence of it in real environments, nor documentation regarding the complex challenge of the deployment. Since DL requires considerable resources and fog nodes are resource-limited, a very efficient deployment and resource usage is critical. We present an innovative highly-efficient intelligent system based on a fog-cloud computing architecture to timely detect falls using DL technics deployed on resource-constrained devices (fog nodes). We employ a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to collect patient monitoring data. In the fog, we propose a smart-IoT-Gateway architecture to support the remote deployment and management of DL models. We deploy two DL models (LSTM/GRU) employing virtualization to optimize resources and evaluate their performance and inference time. The results prove the effectiveness of our fall system, that provides a more timely and accurate response than traditional fall detector systems, higher efficiency, 98.75% accuracy, lower delay, and service improvement.This research was supported by the Ecuadorian Government through the Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation (SENESCYT) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program as part of the ACTIVAGE project under Grant 732679.Sarabia-Jácome, D.; Usach, R.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing.

Bugüne kadar sınıflandırma işlemi genellikle çeşitli algoritmalar yardımıyla yazılımsal olarak yapılmaktaydı, oysa birçok uygulamada, sınıflandırma işlemini daha hızlı ve gerçek zamanda yapmak gerektiğinden bu algoritmaların donanımsal olarak gerçeklenmeleri çok daha yararlı olmaktadır. Ayrıca günümüzde portatif cihazların da artmasından dolayı donanımsal olarak gerçeklenecek cihazlarda da güç tüketimi büyük önem kazanmıştır. Dolayısıyla sınıflandırıcı devrelerin de bu ihtiyaçları karşılayacak şekilde tasarlanması gerekmektedir. Bu makalede akım-modlu düşük güçte çalışan bir sınıflandırıcı devresi sunulmaktadır. Önerilen sınıflandırıcı devresi, temel bir bloktan yararlanmaktadır; bu temel bloklar kullanılarak daha gelişmiş sınıflandırıcı yapılarının gerçekleştirilebileceği gösterilmiştir.

However, to develop well defined software and hardware based criteria in the application of pattern recognition problems, is possible. The aim of classification can be defined as to assign an unknown object to a class containing similar objects (or to distinguish objects having the same properties from those not possessing). Classification is especially important in the real world applications or in the digital world. Basic classification methods using nearest neighbourhood algorithm have first been seen in early sixties under the subject tile"" pattern recognition."" Classification is used in a huge variety of applications such as automatic target identification, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence, template matching, pattern recognition, analog to digital converters, quantization, medical diagnosis, statistics etc. Therefore nowadays, be it in the real or digital world, data classification is becoming increasingly important. But until recently, major work on classification was on developing algorithms used in software packages whereas, in many applications it is becoming more and more important to classify data much faster and in real time, entailing the need for hardware realization of these algorithms. Software approaches are not practical for real time applications, the processing is computationally very expensive, consuming a lot of Central Processing Unit (CPU) time when implemented as software running on general purpose computers. So in literature hardware implementation of classifier topologies become necessary. Also in literature hardware realized classifiers which are designed to work in low power operation; moreover some of these hardware classifiers do not have custom tunability. So they can only be used for a specific application. The recent developments in electronics technology has created a perfect medium for the hardware realization of classifier structures which, in turn, will render many classifier application prospects feasible in real time. This paper targets the design and application to real world problems of tunable, low power new classifier circuits using CMOS technology. So, a low-power CMOS implementation of a multi-input data classifier with several output levels is presented. The proposed circuit operates in current-mode and can classify several types of analog vector data. An architecture is developed comprising a threshold circuit based on CMOS transistors operating in subthreshold region. To this purpose a one dimensional classifier, called core circuit is proposed. The core circuit also works as a one-dimensional classifier. As this circuit is designed to operate in currentmode the input and the output data is provided to the core circuit with currents. So by interconnecting several core circuits and adding the output currents a multi output classifier can be obtained. Also, combining several core circuits in groups in such a way that each group has identical input current (different from the others), a multi-dimensional, multi-level output classifier can be obtained. Also, numerous efforts in balancing the trade off between power consumption, area and speed have resulted in an acceptable performance. On the other hand, the rapid increasing use of battery operated portable equipment in application areas such as telecommunications and medical electronics increases the importance of low-power and small sized VLSI circuits' technologies. One solution to achieve lowpower and acceptable performance is to operate the transistors in the subthreshold region. The CMOS transistors working in subthreshold region are suitable only for specific applications which need, not very high performance, but low power consumption. The primary aim of this paper is to develop a low power classifier circuit with n inputs and externally tunable decision regions with different output amplitude for each region. Due to the subthreshold operation of the transistors in the proposed core circuit, very low power consumption becomes possible. The proposed core circuit is constructed with two threshold and a subtractor circuit. The SPICE simulation of the threshold circuit, core circuit, one dimensional and two dimensional classifier circuits are given. Using 0.35 μm parameters of AMS CMOS technology, SPICE simulations are performed and a low-power, custom tunable classifier circuit is realized. Because of the parallel processing characteristic of the circuit, it is well suited for real-world applications",health,290,not included

To solve these complex reinforcement learning problems, we must first decide on a policy representation. But determining the best representation can be challenging, since the environment includes many poorly-understood processes (such as student engagement) and is therefore difficult to accurately simulate. These domains are also high stakes, making it infeasible to evaluate candidate representations by running them online. Instead, one must leverage existing data to learn and evaluate new policies for future use. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology for comparing and validating policies offline. Our method is unbiased, agnostic to representation, and focuses on the ability of each policy to generalize to new data. We apply this methodology to a partially-observable, high-dimensional concept sequencing problem in an educational game. Guided by our evaluation methodology, we propose a novel feature compaction method that substantially improves policy performance on this problem. We deploy the best-performing policies to 2,000 real students and show that the learned adaptive policy shows statistically significant improvement over random and expert baselines, improving our achievement-based reward measure by 32%.",health,291,not included

For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programing (GP) to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem. However, like other AutoML systems, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data. None Results None We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the system's scalability: Feature Set Selector (FSS) and Template. FSS provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. FSS increases TPOT's efficiency in application on big data by slicing the entire dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing GP to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed GP and enables the incorporation of FSS at the beginning of each pipeline. Consequently, FSS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show TPOT-FSS significantly outperforms a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation. We apply TPOT-FSS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of two modules, TPOT-FSS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.

This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.",health,293,not included

The behaviour of diagnostic models could be sensitive with regard to the amount of features, and significant features can represent the problem better than the entire set. Consequently, algorithms to identify these features are valuable contributions. This work deals with the feature selection problem through attribute clustering. The proposed algorithm is inspired by existing approaches, where the relative dependency between attributes is used to calculate dissimilarity values. The centroids of the created clusters are selected as representative attributes. The selection algorithm uses a random process for proposing centroid candidates, in this way, the inherent exploration in random search is included. A hierarchical procedure is proposed for implementing this algorithm. In each level of the hierarchy, the entire set of available attributes is split in disjoint sets and the selection process is applied on each subset. Once the significant attributes are proposed for each subset, a new set of available attributes is created and the selection process runs again in the next level. The hierarchical implementation aims to refine the search space in each level on a reduced set of selected attributes, while the computational time-consumption is improved also. The approach is tested with real data collected from a test bed, results show that the diagnosis precision by using a Random Forest based classifier is over 98 % with only 12 % of the attributes from the available set.",health,294,not included

We further study the correlation between categories in different dimensions, and the trend of different types of bugs. The findings include: (1) semantic bugs are the dominant root cause. As software evolves, semantic bugs increase, while memory-related bugs decrease, calling for more research effort to address semantic bugs; (2) the Linux kernel operating system (OS) has more concurrency bugs than its non-OS counterparts, suggesting more effort into detecting concurrency bugs in operating system code; and (3) reported security bugs are increasing, and the majority of them are caused by semantic bugs, suggesting more support to help developers diagnose and fix security bugs, especially semantic security bugs.

At the same time, many challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends by making use of continuous crowdsourced labelling of public social media content.

The purpose of this article is to describe emerging approaches for assessing stress using speech, which we do by reviewing the methodological advantages of these digital health tools, and the validation, ethical, and privacy issues raised by these technologies. As we describe, it is now possible to assess stress via the speech signal using smartphones and smart speakers that employ software programs and artificial intelligence to analyze several features of speech and speech acoustics, including pitch, jitter, energy, rate, and length and number of pauses. Because these digital devices are ubiquitous, we can now assess individuals' stress levels in real time in almost any natural environment in which people speak. These technologies thus have great potential for advancing digital health initiatives that involve continuously monitoring changes in psychosocial functioning and disease risk over time. However, speech-based indices of stress have yet to be well-validated against stress biomarkers (e.g., cortisol, cytokines) that predict disease risk. In addition, acquiring speech samples raises the possibility that conversations intended to be private could one day be made public; moreover, obtaining real-time psychosocial risk information prompts ethical questions regarding how these data should be used for medical, commercial, and personal purposes. Although assessing stress using speech thus has enormous potential, there are critical validation, privacy, and ethical issues that must be addressed.",health,297,not included

Predicting the time when the size grows to the level where maintenance is needed prevents unexpected efforts and helps to spot problematic artifacts before they become critical.

Virtual prototyping software is essentially multi body simulation software that requires the availability of models of all the vehicle components. The choice of the model is then of paramount importance, since it heavily affects the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results. Conventional models (like linear models) are often inadequate to describe the behavior of complex nonlinear components, so that it is necessary to appeal to different modelling approaches. This is actually the case when dealing with motorcycle suspension systems, given that their most critical part, the shock absorber, exhibits nonlinear and time-variant behavior. In this paper, a grey-box model of a racing motorcycle mono tube shock absorber is proposed. It consists of a nonlinear parametric model and a black-box, neural network based model. The absorber model has been implemented in a numerical simulation environment, and it has been validated against experimental test data. The results of the validation show that the model is able to reproduce the real behavior of the shock absorber with an accuracy that matches or even beats that of other models previously presented in the literature. The interfacing of the proposed model to the ADAMS virtual prototyping environment is also discussed.",industry,310,not included

There is a growing demand in the textile industry to leverage computer vision technology for more efficient quality control in the hope that it will replace the traditional labor-intensive inspection by naked eyes. However, there is an underlying viewpoint in most existing fabric datasets that automatic defect detection is a traditional image classification problem, thus more samples help better, which lacks enough consideration about the problem itself and real application environments. After deep communication with users, we find these facts that an assembly line usually has only a few fixed texture fabrics for a long period, users prefer fast deployment and easily upgradable model to a general model and long-time tuning, and users hope the process of collecting samples, annotating, and deployment affects assembly lines as little as possible. This implies that defect detection is different from popular deep learning problems. Multiple-stage models and fast training become more attractive since users are able to train and deploy models by themselves according to the real conditions of samples that can be obtained. Based on this analysis, we propose a new fabric dataset “ZJU-Leaper”. It provides a series of task settings in accordance with the progressive strategy dealing with the problem, from only normal samples to many defective samples with precise annotations, to facilitate real-world application. To avoid misleading information and inconsistency issues associated with the prior evaluation metrics, we propose a new evaluation protocol by experimental analysis of task-specific indexes, which can tell a truthful comparison between different inspection methods. We also offer some novel solutions to address the new challenges of our dataset, as part of the baseline experiments.

Meanwhile, it is able to reduce the high labor cost of manual inspection and boost the productivity of the textile industry. To develop effective mathematical inspection algorithms, the fabric dataset serves as an indispensable component to present a practical application environment and enable fair evaluation for algorithms. This paper proposes a new dataset, called “ZJU-Leaper” designed from a viewpoint of multiple-stage models and fast training, containing threefold novelty: 1) the data collection and organization consider the actual requirements and special characteristics of assembly lines in textile factories; 2) it has several designed task settings in order to meet the different levels of requirements in the practical inspection task; 3) it provides a reasonable evaluation protocol for comprehensive comparisons between different inspection algorithms. The preliminary experiments show that some existing algorithms still cannot reach the satisfying performance by this benchmark, which implies more effort should be made to develop new methods for the real use of automatic defect inspection.</p>",industry,321,not included

However, in order to achieve good results in a new domain, it is generally demanded to fine-tune a pre-trained deep architecture using new labeled data coming from the target application domain. The fine-tuning procedure is also required when the domain application settings change, e. g., when a camera is moved, or a new camera is installed. This implies the collection and pixel-wise la-beling of images to be used for training, which slows down the deployment of semantic segmentation systems in real industrial scenarios and increases the industrial costs. Taking into account the aforementioned issues, in this paper we propose an approach based on Adversarial Learning to perform scene adaptation for semantic segmentation.

In the proposed system, a human expert demonstrates a finishing operation, and the demonstrated motion is recorded in the Cartesian space. The robot’s kinematic model is augmented with a virtual mechanism, which is defined according to the applied finishing tool. This way, the kinematic model is expanded with additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to compute the optimal joint space motion of the robot without altering the essential aspects of the Cartesian space task execution as demonstrated by the human expert. Finishing operations, such as polishing and grinding, occur in contact with the treated workpiece. Since information about the contact point position is needed to control the robot during the operation, we have developed a novel approach for accurate estimation of contact points using the measured forces and torques. Finally, we applied iterative learning control to refine the demonstrated operations and compensate for inaccurate calibration and different dynamics of the robot and human demonstrator.

Existing approaches are both too complex and too time-consuming to be applied in flexible and small-scale production, which often requires the frequent deployment of new applications. Our approach is based on programming by demonstration and enables the programming of finishing operations also for users who are not specialists in robot programming. Programming by demonstration is especially useful for teaching finishing operations because it enables the transfer of expert knowledge about finishing skills to robots without providing lengthy task descriptions or manual coding. Besides the human demonstration of the desired operation, the proposed approach also requires the availability of the kinematic model for the machine tool applied to carry out the finishing operation. We provide several practical examples of grinding and polishing tools and how to integrate them into our approach. Another feature of the proposed system is that user demonstrations of finishing operations can be transferred between different combinations of robots and machine tools.",industry,347,included

processing can be seen in industries ranging from developing neural network
based pre-distortors for enhanced mobile broadband to designing FPGA-based

thesis, we explore how niche domains can benefit vastly if we look at neurons
as a unique boolean function of the form $f:B^{I} \rightarrow B^{O}$, where $B
= \{0,1\}$. We focus on how to design topologies that complement such a view of
neurons, how to automate such a strategy of neural network design, and
inference of such networks on Xilinx FPGAs. Major hardware borne constraints
arise when designing topologies that view neurons as unique boolean functions.
Fundamentally, realizing such topologies on hardware asserts a strict limit on
the 'fan-in' bits of a neuron due to the doubling of permutations possible with
every increment in input bit-length. We address this limit by exploring
different methods of implementing sparsity and explore activation quantization.
Further, we develop a library that supports training a neural network with
custom sparsity and quantization. This library also supports conversion of
trained Sparse Quantized networks from PyTorch to VERILOG code which is then
synthesized using Vivado, all of which is part of the LogicNet tool-flow. To
aid faster prototyping, we also support calculation of the worst-case hardware
cost of any given topology. We hope that our insights into the behavior of
extremely sparse quantized neural networks are of use to the research community

Moreover, the similarity of color also poses a challenge in segmentation. In
this article, we propose to divide the pose estimation process into three

convolutional neural network was utilized to perform object detection.
Concerning the reliability of surface texture, we leveraged the contour

inapplicable to clustered metal parts due to the difficulties in segmentation,
we use the dense discrete points along the metal part edges as semantic
keypoints for contour detection. Afterward, we exploit both keypoint

However, the implementation of NMPC in real time has two challenges: Firstly, the design of an accurate non-linear model, which can run many times faster than real time. Secondly, the usage of a rapid and reliable optimization algorithm to solve the optimization problem in real time. To solve these issues, the constrained MIMO NMPC is created based on the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm as a result of its clarity, ease of use, and capacity to deal with problems in one algorithm. In addition, seven ensembles of eight multi-input single-output (MISO) non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models are used as a base model for the GPC controller to predict the future process outputs. Estimation of free and forced responses of the GPC based on the neural network (NN) model of the plant each sampling time without performing instantaneous linearization is proposed in this study, which reduces the NMPC optimization problem to a linear optimization problem at each sampling step. In addition, the Hildreth's quadratic programming algorithm is used to solve the quadratic optimization problem within the NMPC controller, which offers ease of use and reliability in real time applications.

Therefore, new scalable approaches are required to perform hyperspectral image analysis. In this article we address an efficient methodology for conducting Unsupervised Image Segmentation – one of the basic and most fundamental image analysis operations. In the methodology proposed, unsupervised segmentation is conducted after transforming the spectral and spatial dimensions of the raw hyperspectral image into a more compact representation using multivariate and multiresolution techniques. The clusters identified in the compact image representation are then used to train a discriminative classifier. The classifier is then adapted and transferred for application to the raw image, where it will efficiently label all the original pixels. With the proposed methodology, the computational expensive operations (unsupervised clustering and classifier learning) are minimized, whereas the efficient implementation of the classifier guarantees the analysis at the native resolution.

Retrofitting carbon capture technologies to existing fossil-fuel fired power plants is an important solution to avoid the “lock-in” of emissions, but the high operating costs hinders their large scale application. The coexistence of renewable power and carbon capture opens up a new avenue that the deployment of carbon capture can provide additional flexibility for better accommodation of renewable power while excess renewables can be used to reduce the operating costs of carbon capture. To this end, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence based optimal scheduling strategy for the power plant-carbon capture system in the context of renewable power penetration to show that the mutual benefits between carbon capture and renewable power can be achieved when the carbon capture process is made fully adjustable. An artificial intelligent deep belief neural network is used to reflect the complex interactions between carbon, heat and electricity within the power plant carbon capture system. Multiple operating goals are considered in the scheduling such as minimizing the operating costs, renewable power curtailment and carbon emission, and the particle swarm heuristic optimization is employed to find the optimal solution. The impacts of carbon capture constraint mode, carbon emission penalty coefficient, carbon dioxide production constraints and renewable power installed capacity are investigated to provide broader insight on the potential benefit of carbon capture in future low-carbon energy system. A case study using real world data of weather condition and load demand shows that renewable power curtailment can be reduced by 51% with the integration of post-combustion capture systems and 35% of total carbon emission are captured by the use of excess renewable power through optimal scheduling.

Even industrial electronic component and system design also prefer same slim fashion. On other hand the overheating of electronic components reduces its performance, life and by the way the reliability of such electronic product/system is greatly affected due to overheating. The conventional cooling methods failed to offer best performances. Hence this part of research proposed a effective two phase cooling technique with nano-fluid. The objective of this research is to maintain the maximum temperature at the junction and hot spots in order to break a new ground in the cooling of electronic systems. The Maximum permissible operating temperature for any commercial electronic applications is only upto 70 °C (equal to 343.15 K) and above which most of the inherent electronic circuits may malfunction and destroy the entire application.The HotSpot Simulator-6.0 software employed for establish, verify the simulated model and trial runs to answer many ‘what if’ questions. In the simulation, hottest spot has been found in Int_Reg region, where the steady temperature grows beyond the threshold temperature level. The temperature has to be decreased in order to provide reliable working environment. Hence, HFO 1234ze nano-fluid employed with flow rate of 1100 ml per minute. The nanofliuid minimizes the temperature of the simulated electronic circuit from 351.80 K to 326.86 K in UUT. The proposed two phase nano-fluid cooling system for 3-D Unit-Under Test (UUT) was verified and validated with real system and simulated for experiments. Thus, a high range of temperature difference from the initial and final steady state temperature has been evidently shown in the proposed two phase nano fluid cooling method.

In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production.

Unfortunately, to be implemented, this kind of testing method often incurs very high costs (expensive instruments, long test time…). A common approach, in the literature, is the so-called indirect/alternate test strategy. This strategy consists in deriving targeted specifications from low-cost Indirect Measurements (IMs). During the industrial test phase, the estimation of regular specifications using IMs is based on a correlation model that has been built previously, during a training phase. Despite the substantial test cost reduction offered by this strategy, its deployment in industry is limited, mainly because of a lack of confidence in the accuracy of estimations made by the correlation model. A solution to increase the confidence in the estimation of specifications using the indirect approach is to implement redundancy in the prediction phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that the redundancy implementation brings more than identifying rare misjudged circuits from a high-correlated model. Indeed redundancy massively increases the accuracy despite of the lack of accurate models that have been assumed in previous implementations of redundant indirect testing.

Fuzzy membership functions are generated for completion, job waiting and machine idle times. Different methods are proposed to obtain the fuzzy parameters. To model the functional relation between the input and output variables, multilayered feedforward networks (MFNs) trained with error backpropagation learning rule are used. The trained network is able to apply the learnt relationship to new problems. In this paper, an implementation alternative to the existing heuristic algorithms is provided. Once the network is trained adequately, it can provide an outcome (solution) faster than conventional iterative methods by its generalizing property.

For reclamation of this water, manufacturing of new sorbent for permeable reactive barrier was required through precipitation of Mg and Fe hydroxides nanoparticles on the activated carbon (AC) surface with best Mg/Fe molar ratio of 7.5/2.5. Mixture of 50% coated AC and 50% scrap iron was applied to eliminate SO42− from contaminated water with efficiency of 59% and maximum capacity of adsorption equals to 9.5 mg/g for a time period of 1 h, sorbent dosage 40 g/L, and initial pH = 5 at 50 mg/L initial SO42− concentration and 200 rpm shaking speed. Characterization analyses certified that the plantation of Mg and Fe nanoparticles onto AC was achieved. Continuous tests showed that the longevity of composite sorbent is increased with thicker bed and lower influent concentration and flow rate. Computer solution (COMSOL) software was well simulated for continuous measurements. The reclamation of real contaminated groundwater was achieved in column set-up with efficiency of 70% when flow rate was 5 mL/min, bed depth was 50 cm and inlet SO42− concentration was 2301 mg/L.Validerad;2021;Nivå 2;2021-07-29 (beamah);Forskningsfinansiär: Taif University (TURSP-2020/49)</p",industry,395,not included

Variety of services and applications can be built based on the availability and accessibility of indoor positioning information, for example indoor navigation and various location-based services. Different approaches have been proposed to provide indoor positioning information to users, in which an underlying system infrastructure is usually assumed to be well deployed in advance to provide the position information to users. Among many others, one common strategy is to deploy a bunch of active sensor nodes, such as WiFi APs and Bluetooth transceivers, to the indoor environment to serve as reference landmarks. The user's current location can thus be obtained directly or indirectly according to the active sensor signals collected by the user. Different from conventional infrastructure-based approaches, which put additional sensor devices to the environment, we utilize available objects in the environment as location landmarks. Leveraging wildly available smartphone devices as customer premises equipment to the user and the cutting-edge deep-learning technology, we investigate the feasibility of an infrastructure-free intelligent indoor positioning system based on visual information only. The proposed scheme has been verified by a real case study, which is to provide indoor positioning information to users in Taipei Main Station, one of the busiest transportation stations in the world. We use available pedestrian directional signage as location landmarks, which include all of the 52 pedestrian directional signs in the testing area. The Google Objection Detection framework is applied for detection and recognition of the pedestrian directional sign. According to the experimental results, we have shown that the proposed scheme can achieve as high as 98% accuracy to successfully identify the 52 pedestrian directional signs for the three test data sets which include 6,341 test images totally.

Human platelet concentrates are sources of growth factors for cell expansion but such products are characterized by undesired variability. Pooling together single-donor products improves consistency, but the minimal pool sample size was never determined. Methods Supernatant rich in growth factors (SRGF) derived from n = 44 single-donor platelet-apheresis was obtained by CaCl2 addition. n = 10 growth factor concentrations were measured. The data matrix was analyzed by a novel statistical algorithm programmed to create 500 groups of random data from single-donor SRGF and to repeat this task increasing group statistical sample size from n = 2 to n = 20. Thereafter, in created groups (n = 9500), the software calculated means for each growth factor and, matching groups with the same sample size, the software retrieved the percent coefficient of variation (CV) between calculated means. A 20% CV was defined as threshold. For validation, we assessed the CV of concentrations measured in n = 10 pools manufactured according to algorithm results. Finally, we compared growth rate and differentiation potential of adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASC) expanded by separate SRGF pools. Results Growth factor concentrations in single-donor SRGF were characterized by high variability (mean (pg/ml)–CV); VEGF: 950–81.4; FGF-b: 27–74.6; PDGF-AA: 7883–28.8; PDGF-AB: 107834–32.5; PDGF-BB: 11142–48.4; Endostatin: 305034–16.2; Angiostatin: 197284–32.9; TGF-β1: 68382–53.7; IGF-I: 70876–38.3; EGF: 2411–30.2). In silico performed analysis suggested that pooling n = 16 single-donor SRGF reduced CV below 20%. Concentrations measured in 10 pools of n = 16 single SRGF were not different from mean values measured in single SRGF, but the CV was reduced to or below the threshold. Separate SRGF pools failed to differently affect ASC growth rate (slope pool A = 0.6; R2 = 0.99; slope pool B = 0.7; R2 0.99) or differentiation potential. Discussion Results deriving from our algorithm and from validation utilizing real SRGF pools demonstrated that pooling n = 16 single-donor SRGF products can ameliorate variability of final growth factor concentrations. Different pools of n = 16 single donor SRGF displayed consitent capability to modulate growth and differentiation potential of expanded ASC.

Smart contracts also can be mentioned here, although the ’intelligence’ of smart contracts still needs to be seriously elaborated. These trends should inevitably lead to an increased role of logical methods working with semantics, and significantly expand the scope of their application in practice. However, there are a number of problems that hinder this process.

We are developing an approach, which makes the application of logical modeling efficient in some important areas. The approach is based on the concept of locally simple models and is primarily focused on solving tasks in the management of enterprises, organizations, governing bodies. The most important feature of locally simple models is their ability to replace software systems. Replacement of programming by modeling gives huge advantages, for instance, it dramatically reduces development and support costs. Modeling, unlike programming, preserves the explicit semantics of models allowing integration with artificial intelligence and robots. In addition, models are much more understandable to general people than programs.

In this paper we propose the implementation of the concept of locally simple modeling on the basis of so-called document models, which has been developed by us earlier. It is shown that locally simple modeling is realized through document models with finite submodel coverages.

This scenario reveals an enabling environment for the use of an Expert system. The goal of the study was to develop an Expert system based on artificial intelligence for supporting the transcatheter aortic prosthesis selection.  Methods: The system was developed on Expert SINTA. The rules were created according to anatomical parameters indicated by the manufacturing company. Annular aortic diameter, aortic area, aortic perimeter, ascending aorta diameter and Valsalva sinus diameter were considered. After performing system accuracy tests, it was applied in a retrospective cohort of 22 patients with submitted to the CoreValve prosthesis implantation. Then, the system indications were compared to the real heart team decisions.  Results: For 10 (45.4%) of the 22 patients there was no concordance between the Expert system and the heart team. In all cases with discordance, the software was right in the indication. Then, the patients were stratified in two groups (same indication vs. divergent indication). The baseline characteristics did not show any significant difference. Mortality, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, aortic regurgitation and prosthesis leak did not present differences. Therefore, the maximum aortic gradient in the post-procedure period was higher in the Divergent Indication group (23.9 mmHg vs. 11.9 mmHg, P=0.03), and the mean aortic gradient showed a similar trend.  Conclusion: The utilization of the Expert system was accurate, showing good potential in the support of medical decision. Patients with divergent indication presented high post-procedure aortic gradients and, even without clinical repercussion, these parameters, when elevated, can lead to early prosthesis dysfunction and the necessity of reoperation",industry,399,not included

In order to obtain the numeric estimation along with its reliability, the construction of prediction intervals (PIs) is highly demanded by any practical applications as well as being long term for providing more information on future trends. Bearing this in mind, in this article, a hierarchical granular computing (HGrC)-based model is established for constructing long-term PIs, in which probabilistic modeling gives rise to a long horizon of numeric prediction, and the deployment of information granularities hierarchically extends the result to be interval-valued format. Considering that the structure of this model has a direct impact on its performance, Monte-Carlo search with a policy gradient technique is then applied for reinforcement structure learning. Compared with the existing methods, the size (length) of the granules in the proposed approach is unequal so that it becomes effective for not only periodic but also nonperiodic data. Furthermore, with the use of parallel strategy, the efficiency can be also guaranteed for real-world applications.

In modern software development, developers frequently use different applications including IDEs, Web Browsers, documentation software (such as Office Word, Excel, and PDF applications), and other tools to complete their tasks. This creates significant challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. Researchers usually instrument the software tools to log developers’ behavior for further studies. This is feasible for studies on development activities using specific software tools. However, instrumenting all software tools commonly used in real work settings is difficult and requires significant human effort. Furthermore, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. This abstraction is often performed manually or based on simple heuristics. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the above two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. First, we use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. ActivitySpace uses operating-system level instrumentation to track developer interactions with a wide range of applications in real work settings. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach to reduce the human effort to abstract low-level behavior data. Specifically, considering the sequential nature of the interaction data, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers’ low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To validate the generalizability of the proposed data collection approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner’s company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers’ one-week work in three actual software projects. The experiment with the collected data confirms that with initial human-labeled training data, the CRF model can be trained to infer development activities from low-level actions with reasonable accuracy within and across developers and software projects. This suggests that the machine learning approach is promising in reducing the human efforts required for behavior data analysis.",industry,403,included

An increasing number of people are playing electronic games, placing them among other favorite leisure activities. When surveyed on the most fun entertainment activities in the year 2000, 35 percent of all Americans identified computer and video games, where watching television fell second at 18 percent, followed by surfing the internet (15%), reading books (13 %) and going to the movies (11%) [8]. On-line gaming has offered people new means of having social interaction with people in faraway locations and let them access and play out fantasy-driven identities they are unable to manifest in the real world [12]. In 2002, the percentage of frequent game players that play games online rose to 31 percent up from 24 percent the year before [8]. Within the games, or through the use of websites based around the games, dedicated and long-lived communities have formed which have created new content, sometimes leading to commercial ventures. Electronic game play, however, is not limited to home use. Game parlors and LAN parties are becoming a popular means to play online games. Also, 37 percent of Americans who own game consoles (or computers used to play games), report that they also play games on mobile devices such as PDAs and mobile phones [8]. The popularity of computer games has thus not only made them important carriers of culture and trends but also a financially interesting area. They also function as a vehicle for the development and deployment of new hardware, software and user interface techniques. According to Interactive Digital Software Association (www.idsa.com), the computer and video game software industry in the US generated $6.35 billon in sales from 225 million units in 2001 (up 7.9% and 4.5% from 2000 respectively).

As a technique of providing protection, many intrusion detection system (IDS) studies have been conducted. However, because of the complicated network environment and rising means of attack, it is difficult to cover all attack classes, most of the existing classification techniques are hard to deploy in a real environment since they cannot deal with the open set problem. We propose a novel artificial neural network based-methodology to solve this problem. Our suggested method can classify known classes while also detecting unknown classes. We conduct research from two points of view. On the one hand, we use the openmax layer instead of the traditional softmax layer. Openmax overcomes the limitations of softmax, allowing neural networks to detect unknown attack classes.

In addition to random coefficient initialization, the main advantages for these learning models are the speed of training (no multiple iterations required) and no initial coefficient definition (e.g. no adaptation constant as in multilayer perceptron). These features are adequate for real time operation since a fast online training can be achieved, benefiting to applications (industrial, automotive, portable systems) where other neural networks learning approaches could not be used due to large resource usage, low speed and lack of flexibility. Thus, targeting hardware implementation allows its use in embedded systems, expanding its application areas to real time systems and, in general, those applications where the use of desktop computers is not possible.

Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers’ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers’ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively.

UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating in real time on a reasonably modern workstation.

This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive deployment strategy for UAV-aided networks based on hybrid deep reinforcement learning, where a UAV can adjust its movement direction and distance to serve users who move randomly in the target area. Through hybrid deep reinforcement learning, UAVs can be trained offline to obtain the global state information and learn a completely distributed control strategy, with which each UAV only needs to take actions based on its observed state in the real deployment to be fully adaptive. Moreover, in order to improve the speed and effect of learning, we improve hybrid reinforcement learning, by adding genetic algorithms and TD-error-based resampling optimization mechanism. Simulation results show that the hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm has better efficiency and robustness in multi-UAV control, and has better performance in terms of coverage, energy consumption and average throughput, by which average throughput can be increased by 20% to 60%.",smart cities,433,not included

Indeed, as the brain's neural network is already entrained in its physical hardware, it clearly does not require an ANN software add-on to learn from natural data.

evasion attacks, in which a malware developer manipulates their malicious
software such that it is misclassified as benign. Such software hides some

applying small perturbations. A special case of evasive malware hides by
repackaging a bonafide benign mobile app to contain malware in addition to the
original functionality of the app, thus retaining most of the benign properties
of the original app. We present a novel malware detection system based on
metamorphic testing principles that can detect such benign-seeming malware

features removed. If the app was originally classified benign and is indeed
benign, the output for the source and derived inputs should be the same class,
i.e., benign, but if they differ, then the app is exposed as likely malware.
Malware apps originally classified as malware should retain that classification
since only features prevalent in benign apps are removed. This approach enables
the machine learning model to classify repackaged malware with reasonably few
false negatives and false positives. Our training pipeline is simpler than many

allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data
crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real
working location to improve its utility, which causes adverse effects to the
spatial crowdsourcing platform. To address this issue, we present three
strategyproof deployment mechanisms for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to
place a mobile base station, e.g., vehicle or robot, which is responsible for
transferring the wireless power and collecting the crowdsourced data. As the
benchmark, we first apply the classical median mechanism and evaluate its
worst-case performance. Then, we design a conventional strategyproof deployment
mechanism to improve the expected utility of the spatial crowdsourcing platform
under the condition that the workers' locations follow a known geographical
distribution. For a more general case with only the historical location data
available, we propose a deep learning based strategyproof deployment mechanism
to maximize the spatial crowdsourcing platform's utility. Extensive
experimental results based on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in allocating tasks and charging power
to workers while avoiding the dishonest worker's manipulation.",smart cities,473,not included

The performance of secondary user communication depends largely on the intelligent choice of an appropriate spectral opportunity. The purpose of this research is to propose and assess the performance of a spectral decision model for CRN based on the Deep Learning technique. To achieve this, a classifier was adapted through the feature extraction technique that identifies three levels of traffic (high, medium and low) in a spectral occupation experimental power matrix that models the primary user. The extraction of features is done by Deep Learning and the process of classifying the successful set of features is done by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). These were used along with five evaluation metrics—total handoffs, failed handoffs, bandwidth, delay and throughput—to measure the performance of the proposed spectral decision model based on the Deep Learning technique, and to compare the results with the Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution (VIKOR), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW). This work presents five contributions: incorporation of the real behavior of licensed users, implementation of performance metrics for spectral mobility, proposal of an RGB conversion algorithm based on the threshold level, feedback in the classifier and a methodology based on priorities and scores to establish the channels with the highest availability.

Compared with the traditional stripping method, the GDE-based electrochemical system has a certain potential to be competitive, in terms of energy consumption. For instance, a rough-cost estimate based only on operating costs regarding chemical usage, air blowing, and water pumping revealed that the system consumed 13.44 kWh/kg N, whereas the conventional stripper required 27.6 kWh/kg N. This analysis showed that an electrochemical approach such as our GDE-based method can recover NH3, (particularly in gaseous form) from LW.

So current methods are based on reduced complexity models or flight envelopes are determined locally. This paper presents a novel method to estimate the global flight envelope of impaired aircraft in real-time for any unknown failure degree. In the proposed method, first, numerous flight envelopes are evaluated using a high fidelity model at various failure degrees and different flight conditions and prepared as training data. Then multiple feedforward neural networks are trained offline by a Bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm. Finally, the trained networks are used to estimate flight envelopes in real time.

To demonstrate the applicability of the DA methodology, we performed numerical experiments in which a priori assumed true parameters related to the grain boundary (GB) energy cusp and GB mobility peak of Σ7 coincidence site lattice GB were estimated from synthetic data of time-evolving polycrystalline microstructure.

In order to minimize the total cost, this study simultaneously considers semitrailer truck and vehicle sharing, and establishes a linear mathematical model capable of interpreting real world practices under single or multiple alliances scenarios. An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm are reasonably combined into a hybrid meta-heuristics to solve the cooperative 2E-LDPN optimization problem. This algorithm combines the merits of IPSO and ACO with local and global search capabilities, and redistributes customer zones on the basis of region partitioning solutions in order to rationalize transportation activities. Finally, an Improved Shapley value model is applied to guarantee profits allocation's fairness and is proved reliable in term of alliance stability. Empirical results out of a case study in Chongqing city show that the IPSO–ACO hybrid algorithm is superior to three well-known algorithms on the cost solution and the number of iterations. Using the Improved Shapley value model and strictly monotonic path (SMP) selection principles, optimal adhesion sequences for two alliances and a grand alliance are yielded.

E-Water aims at providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mékrou river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland.
                  In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization.
                  To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and hypothetical scenarios in the Mékrou river basin. The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income.

In problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. However, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. The present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. The method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. Each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. While the initial control area is radial, its shape is adaptively improved using a Hermite interpolation procedure. The modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. As optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. The modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the Greek island of Santorini.

                  Neural networks can risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with potential acute coronary syndromes with a high specificity, potentially facilitating ED discharge of patients to home. We hypothesized that the use of “real-time” neural networks would decrease the admission rate for ED chest pain patients.
               
                  Methods
                  We conducted a before-and-after trial. Consecutive ED patients with chest pain were evaluated before and after implementation of a neural network in an urban university ED. Data included 40 variables used in neural networks for acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Data were obtained in real time, and neural network outputs were provided to the treating physician while patients were in the ED. On hospital discharge, attending physicians received feedback, including neural network output, their initial clinical impression, cardiac test results, and final diagnosis. The main outcome was the actual admit/discharge decision made before versus after the implementation of the neural network.
               
                  Results
                  Before implementation, 4,492 patients were enrolled; after implementation, 432 patients were enrolled. Implementation of the neural network did not decrease the hospital admission rate (before: 62.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 61.3% to 64.1%] versus after: 66.6% [95% CI 62.2% to 71.0%]). Additionally, the ICU admission rates were not different (11.4% [95% CI 10.5% to 12.3%] versus 9.3% [95% CI 6.6% to 12.0%]). Physician query found that the neural network changed management in only 2 cases (<1%).
               
                  Conclusion
                  The use of real-time neural network feedback did not influence the admission decision for ED patients with chest pain, most likely because the neural network output was delayed until the return of cardiac markers, and the disposition decision had already been made by that time.",smart cities,495,not included

In 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, many predicted that sealed gates would soon become relics of a bygone era. Today, we find a different reality. Instead of disappearing, borders are transforming. In this article, we build upon the shifting border logic to explore how responses to the global pandemic have accelerated processes of detachment of mobility control from a fixed territorial marker. From global travel bans to mandating prearrival proof of a negative test result taken within 48 or 72 hours prior to departure to requiring digital registration of a passenger's travel history to enforcing strict post-arrival mandatory quarantine orders that arrest mobility, the shifting border paradigm has provided a template for policymakers to respond to a mounting global crisis. In addition to regulating movement across international borders and within countries, we trace the surprising return of subnational and interregional division lines in managing mobility, the erosion of the once taken for granted right to return to one’s home country, and the spatial and legal techniques used to block refugees from reaching terra firma during the pandemic. Next, we critically evaluate the authorization given under emergency regulations to deploy novel biometric and AI technologies, big data, and predictive algorithms to surveil moving bodies at real time and reprimand those deemed to have breached their quarantine or related governmental emergency measures. While drastic times call for drastic measures, techniques of movement control that ""scan"" and trace our bodies raise serious questions about justice, fairness, and the risk of discrimination, which may well remain with us even long after the pandemic is over",smart cities,496,not included

Predictions of human movement based on these transaction streams represents tremendous new opportunities from optimizing fleet allocation of on-demand transportation such as UBER and LYFT to dynamic pricing of services. However, transportation research thus far has primarily focused on tackling other challenges from traffic congestion to network capacity. To take on this new opportunity, we propose a real-time framework, called PULSE (Prediction Framework For Usage Load on Subway SystEms), that offers accurate multi-granular arrival crowd flow prediction at subway stations. PULSE extracts and employs two types of features such as streaming features and station profile features. Streaming features are time-variant features including time, weather, and historical traffic at subway stations (as time-series of arrival/departure streams), where station profile features capture the time-invariant unique characteristics of stations, including each station’s peak hour crowd flow, remoteness from the downtown area, and mean flow. Then, given a future prediction interval, we design novel stream feature selection and model selection algorithms to select the most appropriate machine learning models for each target station and tune that model by choosing an optimal subset of stream traffic features from other stations. We evaluate our PULSE framework using real transaction data of 11 million passengers from a subway system in Shenzhen, China.

This paper presents a novel methodology for optimizing the traffic signal timings in signalized urban intersections, under non-recurrent traffic incidents. With the purpose of producing fast and reliable decisions, we combine the fast running Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and the reliable Genetic Algorithms (GA) into a single optimization framework. Firstly, we deploy a typical GA algorithm by considering the phase duration as the decision variable and the objective function as the total travel time in the network. We fine tune the GA for crossover, mutation, fitness calculation and obtain the optimal parameters. Secondly, we train several regression models to predict the total travel time in the studied traffic network, and select the best performing model which we further hyper-tune. Lastly, we propose a new algorithm BGA-ML combining the GA algorithm and the extreme-gradient decision-tree (XGBT), which is the best performing regression model, together in a single optimization framework. Comparison and results are generated by two experiments (one synthetic and one from real urban traffic network) and show that the new BGA-ML is much faster than the original GA algorithm and can reduce the total travel time by almost half when used under incident conditions.",smart cities,500,not included

Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, is no exception in exceeding the healthy levels of pollution. In addition to the impact of urbanization, motorization, and rapid population growth, particulate pollution is modulated by meteorological factors and geophysical characteristics, which complicate the implementation of the most advanced models of weather forecast. Thus, this paper proposes a machine learning approach based on six years of meteorological and pollution data analyses to predict the concentrations of PM2.5 from wind (speed and direction) and precipitation levels. The results of the classification model show a high reliability in the classification of low ( 25 µg/m3) and low (<10 µg/m3) versus moderate (10–25 µg/m3) concentrations of PM2.5. A regression analysis suggests a better prediction of PM2.5 when the climatic conditions are getting more extreme (strong winds or high levels of precipitation). The high correlation between estimated and real data for a time series analysis during the wet season confirms this finding. The study demonstrates that the use of statistical models based on machine learning is relevant to predict PM2.5 concentrations from meteorological data.",smart cities,502,not included

Identifying emerging applications based on well-known port numbers is no longer reliable. While deep packet inspection (DPI) solutions can be accurate, they require constant updates of signatures and become infeasible for encrypted payload especially in multimedia applications (e.g. Skype). Statistical approaches based on machine learning have thus been considered more promising and robust to encryption, privacy, protocol obfuscation, etc. However, the computation complexity of traffic classification using those statistical solutions is high, which prevents them being deployed in systems that need to manage Internet traffic in real time. This paper proposes a FPGA-based parallel architecture to accelerate the statistical identification of multimedia applications while maintaining high classification accuracy. Specifically, we base our design on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm which has been shown to be one of the most accurate machine learning algorithms for Internet traffic classification. To enable high-rate data streaming for real-time classification, we adopt the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for approximate k-NN. The LSH scheme is carefully designed to achieve high accuracy while being efficient for implementation on FPGA. Processing components in the architecture are optimized to realize high throughput.

Such an estimate is required by most 3-D to 2-D registration and tracking methods that can efficiently refine an initial value by numerical optimization to precisely recover 3-D pose. However the analytic computation of an initial pose guess requires the solution of an extremely complex correspondence problem that is due to the large number of topologically distinct aspects that arise when a three dimensional opaque object is imaged by a camera. Hence general analytic methods fail to achieve real-time performance and most tracking and registration systems are initialized interactively or by ad hoc heuristics. To overcome these limitations we present a novel method for approximate object pose estimation that is based on a neural net and that can easily be implemented in real-time. A modification of Kohonen's self-organizing feature map is systematically trained with computer generated object views such that it responds to a preprocessed image with one or more sets of object orientation parameters. The key idea proposed here is to choose network topology in accordance with the representation of 3-D orientation. Experimental results from both simulated and real images demonstrate that a pose estimate within the accuracy requirements can be found in more than 81% of all cases. The current implementation operates at 10 Hz on real world images.,multimedia,513,not included

This is a problem of generic interest to researchers in the computer graphics, computer vision, artificial intelligence and robotics community where it plays an important role in applications such as object recognition, mapping, navigation and conversion from point clouds representations to 3D surface models. Prior work on the subject is either computationally burdensome, precluding real time applications such as robotic navigation and mapping, prone to error for noisy measurements commonly found at long range or requires availability of coregistered color imagery. The approach we describe consists of 3 steps: (1) detect a set of candidate planar surfaces, (2) cluster the planar surfaces merging redundant plane models, and (3) segment the point clouds by imposing a Markov Random Field (MRF) on the data and planar models and computing the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) of the segmentation labels using Bayesian Belief Propagation (BBP). In contrast to prior work which relies on color information for geometric segmentation, our implementation performs detection, clustering and estimation using only geometric data. Novelty is found in the fast clustering technique and new MRF clique potentials that are heretofore unexplored in the literature. The clustering procedure removes redundant detections of planes in the scene prior to segmentation using BBP optimization of the MRF to improve performance. The MRF clique potentials dynamically change to encourage distinct labels across depth discontinuities. These modifications provide improved segmentations for geometry-only depth images while simultaneously controlling the computational cost. Algorithm parameters are tunable to enable researchers to strike a compromise between segmentation detail and computational performance. Experimental results apply the algorithm to depth images from the NYU depth dataset which indicate that the algorithm can accurately extract large planar surfaces from depth sensor data.",multimedia,514,not included

Simultaneously, we have seen growing interest in orbital activities such as satellite servicing and debris removal that depend on proximity operations between spacecraft. However, two key challenges currently pose a major barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity operations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an effective system for model development that streamlines data curation, training, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images of a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This paper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically for on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges. The core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a cloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development process. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset, to generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses (positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly observed in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based framework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common functionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all projects while giving complete independence to project-specific code. Time-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation and model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to any scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and models from any machine. The presented system has been used in the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory with marked benefits in development speed and quality. Remote development, scalable compute, and automatic organization of data and artifacts have dramatically decreased iteration time while increasing reproducibility and system comprehension. Diverse, high-fidelity synthetic images that more closely replicate the real environment have improved model performance against real-world data.

Our approach is unique in that it handles obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability, and rotation of footstep placements, which typically have required non-convex constraints, in a single mixed-integer optimization that can be efficiently solved to its global optimum. Reachability is enforced through a convex inner approximation of the reachable space for the robot's feet. Rotation of the footsteps is handled by a piecewise linear approximation of sine and cosine, designed to ensure that the approximation never overestimates the robot's reachability. Obstacle avoidance is ensured by decomposing the environment into convex regions of obstacle-free configuration space and assigning each footstep to one such safe region. We demonstrate this technique in simple 2D and 3D environments and with real environments sensed by a humanoid robot. We also discuss computational performance of the algorithm, which is currently capable of planning short sequences of a few steps in under one second or longer sequences of 10-30 footsteps in tens of seconds to minutes on common laptop computer hardware.

Meanwhile, to clarify our achievements following scientific method, we have to establish our evaluation function FMI to give a score to tell what level of goodness our implementation could achieve. The first task is implementation of different region growing algorithms. We implement a general split and merge algorithm and the Blob Coloring algorithm that can work both in 2D and in 3D with different homogeneity criteria. For the split and merge algorithm, we will use quad-tree algorithm to split and merge our image based on the homogeneity. For the blob algorithm, we will check the L shape, then merge the pixels with similar homogeneity, and ignore those not. According to the experimental results, We found the split merge algorithm is generally better than the blob algorithm. Although for some case, the blob algorithm can also reach to more than 0.8 FMI score in evaluating, the overall performance is still bad. Split and merge algorithm works well on all the image cases.

The result coming from our implementation could be used in biomedical field such as cancer detection, as well as in public management such as suspects outline detection.

This makes in-cabin monitoring critical to improve safety and mitigate dangerous situations in case of a crash, and especially in high levels of autonomous driving.

Under this model, we use object classifiers to associate low-level visual features to objects, and at the same time, we use contextual relations to associate objects to scenes.

However, the Internet can only provide no guaranteed delivery. The high dynamic of the available bandwidth may cause bitrate switching or video rebuffering, thus inevitably damaging the QoE. Besides, the frequently requested popular videos are transmitted for multiple times and contribute to most of the bandwidth consumption, which causes massive transmission redundancy. Therefore, we propose a Learning-based Edge with cAching and Prefetching (LEAP) to improve the online user QoE of adaptive video streaming. LEAP introduces caching into the edge to reduce the redundant video transmission and employs prefetching to fight against network jitters. Taking the state information of users into account, LEAP intelligently makes the most beneficial decisions of caching and prefetching by a QoE-oriented deep neural network model. To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we deploy the implemented prototype of LEAP in both the simulated scenario and the real Internet. Compared with all selected schemes, LEAP at least raises average bitrate by 34.4% and reduces video rebuffering by 42.7%, which leads to at least 15.9% improvement in the user QoE in the simulated scenario.

With ABR, each video content is transcoded into multiple representations in different bitrates and resolutions. However, video transcoding is computing intensive, which requires the transcoding service providers to deploy a large number of servers for transcoding the video contents published by the content producers. As such, a natural question for the transcoding service provider is how to provision the computing resource for transcoding the video contents while maximizing service profit. To address this problem, we design a cloud video transcoding system by taking the advantage of cloud computing technology to elastically allocate computing resource. We propose a method for jointly considering the task scheduling and resource provisioning problem in two timescales, and formulate the service profit maximization as a two-timescale stochastic optimization problem. We derive some approximate policies for the task scheduling and resource provisioning.

The surging traffic demand, as well as the real-time property of live videos, make it challenging for content delivery networks (CDNs) to guarantee the Quality-of-Experiences (QoE) of viewers. The initial video segment (IVS) of live streaming plays an important role in the QoE of live viewers, particularly when users require fast join time and smooth view experience. State-of-the-art research on this regard estimates network throughput for each viewer and thus may incur a large overhead that offsets the benefit. To tackle the problem, we propose Rldish, a scheme deployed at the edge CDN server, to dynamically select a suitable IVS for new live viewers based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Rldish is transparent to both the client and the streaming server. It collects the real-time QoE observations from the edge without any client-side assistance, then uses these QoE observations as real-time rewards in RL. We deploy Rldish as a virtualized network function (VNF) in a real HTTP cache server, and evaluate its performance using streaming servers distributed over the world. Our experiments show that Rldish improves the state- of-the-art IVS selection scheme w.r.t. the average QoE of live viewers by up to 22%.",multimedia,557,included

Then, an online iterative training procedure is employed to refine the classifier using additional training images. Online adaptation of color probabilities is used to enable the classifier to cope with illumination changes. Tracking over time is realized through a novel technique, which can handle multiple colored blobs.

One such application area is the adoption of Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) by law enforcement officials. The need to be ‘always-on’ puts heavy constraints on battery usage in these camera front-ends, thus limiting their widespread adoption. Further, the increasing number of such cameras is expected to create a data deluge, which requires large processing, transmission and storage capabilities. Instead of continuously capturing and streaming or storing videos, it is prudent to provide “smartness” to the camera front-end. This requires hardware assisted image recognition and template matching in the front-end, capable of making judicious decisions on when to trigger video capture or streaming. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) based neural networks have been shown to provide high accuracy for image recognition and are well suited for low power and re-configurable systems.

In this paper we concentrate on rate-coded AER. The problem is addressed as an algorithmic problem, in which different methods are proposed, implemented and tested through software algorithms. The proposed algorithms are comparatively evaluated according to different criteria. Emphasis is put on the potential of such algorithms for a) doing the frame-based to event-based representation in real time, and b) that the resulting event streams resemble as much as possible those generated naturally by rate-coded address-event VLSI chips, such as silicon AER retinae. It is found that simple and straightforward algorithms tend to have high potential for real time but produce event distributions that differ considerably from those obtained in AER VLSI chips. On the other hand, sophisticated algorithms that yield better event distributions are not efficient for real time operations. The methods based on linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR) pseudorandom number generation is a good compromise, which is feasible for real time and yield reasonably well distributed events in time.

low-rank representations by combining and extending recent ideas for learning
fast sparse coding regressors with structured non-convex optimization
techniques. This approach connects robust principal component analysis (RPCA)
with dictionary learning techniques and allows its approximation via trainable
encoders. We propose an efficient feed-forward architecture derived from an
optimization algorithm designed to exactly solve robust low dimensional
projections. This architecture, in combination with different training
objective functions, allows the regressors to be used as online approximants of
the exact offline RPCA problem or as RPCA-based neural networks. Simple
modifications of these encoders can handle challenging extensions, such as the
inclusion of geometric data transformations. We present several examples with
real data from image, audio, and video processing. When used to approximate
RPCA, our basic implementation shows several orders of magnitude speedup

the strength of the inclusion of learning to the RPCA approach on a music

use data from the robot's actual operating domain during training. Therefore,
it is not possible to rely on pre-built, generic datasets when deploying robots

We formulate skull defect restoration as a 3D volumetric shape completion task, where a partial skull volume is completed automatically. The difference between the completed skull and the partial skull is the restored defect; in other words, the implant that can be used in cranioplasty. To fulfill the task of volumetric shape completion, a fully data-driven approach is proposed. Supervised skull shape learning is performed on a database containing 167 high-resolution healthy skulls. In these skulls, synthetic defects are injected to create training and evaluation data pairs. We propose a patch-based training scheme tailored for dealing with high-resolution and spatially sparse data, which overcomes the disadvantages of conventional patch-based training methods in high-resolution volumetric shape completion tasks. In particular, the conventional patch-based training is applied to images of high resolution and proves to be effective in tasks such as segmentation. However, we demonstrate the limitations of conventional patch-based training for shape completion tasks, where the overall shape distribution of the target has to be learnt, since it cannot be captured efficiently by a sub-volume cropped from the target. Additionally, the standard dense implementation of a convolutional neural network tends to perform poorly on sparse data, such as the skull, which has a low voxel occupancy rate. Our proposed training scheme encourages a convolutional neural network to learn from the high-resolution and spatially sparse data.

These systems, e.g., for real-time 24/7 broadcast transcription, often work with input-stream data containing utterances in more than one language. This multilingual data can correctly be transcribed in real-time only if the language used is identified with just a small latency for each input frame. For this purpose, a novel approach to on-line spoken language identification is proposed in this work. Its development is documented within a series of consecutive experiments starting in the off-line mode for 11 Slavic languages, going through artificially prepared multilingual data for the on-line scenario, and ending with real bilingual TV programs containing utterances in mutually similar Czech and Slovak. The resulting scheme that we propose operates frame-by-frame; it takes in a multilingual stream of speech frames and outputs a stream of the corresponding language labels. It utilizes a weighted finite-state transducer as a decoder, which smooths the output from a language classifier fed by multilingual and augmented bottleneck features. An essential factor from the accuracy point of view is that these features, as well as the classifier itself, are based on deep neural network architectures that allow the modeling of long-term time dependencies. The obtained results show that our scheme allows us to determine the language spoken in real-world bilingual TV shows with an average latency of around 2.5 seconds and with an increase in word error rate by a mere 2.9% over the reference 18.1% value yielded by using manually prepared language labels.",multimedia,609,not included

The new concept of bird’s accent is presented to assess the search ability of particles in their local areas. To conserve the diversity of the population during searching, particles are separated into different accent groups by their regional habitation and are classified into different categories of birds/particles in each cluster according to their common manner of singing. A particle in an accent-group can select other particles as its neighbors from its group or from other groups (which sing differently) if the selected particles have the same expertise in singing or are less experienced compared to this particle. To allow the search escaping from local optima, the most expert particles (parents) “die” and are regularly replaced by a novice (newborn) randomly generated ones.

In new multimedia based networks, new challenges move from technology-oriented services to user-oriented services which prove the importance of QoE. Service providers' growth depends nowadays not only on QoS parameters but also on clients' feeling and expectation. That is why; service providers must measure received QoE and this becomes a challenge regarding the evaluation of users' feeling. For users, qualitative perception differs from one user to another and service providers affront difficulties to transform the qualitative values into the quantitative one. The QoE evaluation needs more sophisticated methods to describe the real expectation of users. New multimedia applications provide at any user locations media who are sharing video, and communicating together in virtual network. These applications require providing the best possible QoE to consumers. When it comes to us, we present in this paper a machine learning approach combined with adaptive coding in order to provide a better QoE for video streaming services. This solution will be established using SDN architecture. We can justify this choice because we need a centralized architecture, where the totality of the network is known, to predict its status. So, we will implement a machine learning algorithm in the controller: this algorithm, called ML-based SSIM, will calculate approximately the quality needed for a video to be streamed.

To protect Virtual Machines (VMs) in which CPSs are functioning against malware-based attacks, malware detection and mitigation technique is emerging as a highly crucial concern. The traditional VM-based anti-malware software themselves a potential target for malware-based attack since they are easily subverted by sophisticated malware. Thus, a reliable and robust malware monitoring and detection systems are needed to detect and mitigate rapidly the malware based cyber-attacks in real time particularly for virtualized environment. The Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) has emerged as a fine-grained out-of-VM security solution to detect malware by introspecting and reconstructing the volatile memory state of the live guest Operating System (OS) by functioning at the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) or hypervisor.

This thesis therefore investigates how to allow deploying AR systems to any device with an attached camera.

One crucial part of an AR system is the detection of arbitrary objects in the camera frame and naturally accompanying the estimation of their 6D-pose.
This increases the degree of scene understanding that AR applications require for placing augmentations in the real world. Currently, this is limited by a coarse segmentation of the scene into planes as provided by the aforementioned frameworks.
Being able to reliably detect individual objects, allows attaching specific augmentations as required by e.g. AR maintenance applications.
For this, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate the 6D-pose of all visible objects from a single RGB image.
Here, the addressed challenge is the automated training of the respective CNN models, given only the CAD geometry of the target object.
First, we look at reconstructing the missing surface data in real-time before we turn to the more general problem of bridging the domain gap between the non-photorealistic representation and the real world appearance.
To this end, we build upon generative adversarial network (GAN) models to formulate the domain gap as an unsupervised learning problem.
Our evaluation shows an improvement in model performance, while providing a simplified handling compared to alternative solutions.

Furthermore, the calibration data of the used camera must be known for precise pose estimation. This data, again, is only available for the restricted set of devices, that the proprietary frameworks support.
To lift this restriction, we propose a web-based camera calibration service that not only aggregates calibration data, but also guides users in the calibration of new cameras.
Here, we first present a novel calibration-pose selection framework that reduces the number of required calibration images by 30% compared to existing solutions, while ensuring a repeatable and reliable calibration outcome.
Then, we present an evaluation of different user-guidance strategies, which allows choosing a setting suitable for most users.
This enables even novice users to perform a precise camera calibration in about 2 minutes.
Finally, we propose an efficient client-server architecture to deploy the aforementioned guidance on the web, making it available to the widest possible range of devices.

The active practice of BVD includes intelligent surveillance and activity recognition, among other challenging tasks. To efficiently address these tasks, the computer vision research community has provided monitoring systems, activity recognition methods, and many other computationally complex solutions for the purposeful usage of BVD. Unfortunately, the limited capabilities of these methods, higher computational complexity, and stringent installation requirements hinder their practical implementation in real-world scenarios, which still demand human operators sitting in front of cameras to monitor activities or make actionable decisions based on BVD. The usage of human-like logic, known as fuzzy logic, has been employed emerging for various data science applications such as control systems, image processing, decision making, routing, and advanced safety-critical systems. This is due to its ability to handle various sources of real world domain and data uncertainties, generating easily adaptable and explainable data-based models. Fuzzy logic can be effectively used for surveillance as a complementary for huge-sized artificial intelligence models and tiresome training procedures. In this paper, we draw researchers’ attention towards the usage of fuzzy logic for surveillance in the context of BVD. We carry out a comprehensive literature survey of methods for vision sensory data analytics that resort to fuzzy logic concepts. Our overview highlights the advantages, downsides, and challenges in existing video analysis methods based on fuzzy logic for surveillance applications. We enumerate and discuss the datasets used by these methods, and finally provide an outlook towards future research directions derived from our critical assessment of the efforts invested so far in this exciting field",multimedia,618,not included

Itinerari nell'Italia del Novecento",01/01/2019 00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/288644199.pdf,,"La   questione   minorile   è   stata   ripercorsa   dalla storiografia soprattutto attraverso il prisma della repressione e prevenzione; nell’Italia  del  Novecento  il  bisogno  di  controllo  sociale,  ‘pensiero dominante’, ha complicato la costruzione del diritto peri minori e deiminori.La codificazione civile, ‘a misura di adulto’, assegnava infatti i diritti al soggetto razionale ed autonomo, quasi a riproporre l’impostazione del paternalismo liberale di Stuart Mill, a proposito di minori da proteggere in primo luogo da se stessi. L’ordinamento contemplava i minori soprattutto per imporgli l’‘antico onora il padre’;anche se il codice civile del 1942 non prevedeva  una  soggezione  totale  dei  figli  rispetto  alla  potestà  genitoriale, prima  del  fascismo  ed  ancoranegli  anni  Cinquanta  la  patria  potestà  era intesa come ‘rimedio’ all’incapacità di agire del figlio, ostacolo all’«azione dello Stato» nell’ordine e disordine della famiglia. Agli inizi del secolo la «protezione giuridica dei minorenni» pareva «sconosciuta al nostro diritto e fuori della legislazione», inadeguata soprattutto nell’impietoso paragone con la legislazione europea e d’oltreoceano; la comparazione con un ‘altrove felice’ –in primo luogo il Children Actdel 1908 –sarebbe stata una costante nelle politiche nazionali per l’infanzia ed adolescenza, dalla Circolaredel guardasigilli V.E. Orlando al Progetto di Codice per i minorenni.Lontano dallo ‘specialismo’ –cifra della scientia iurisnazionale –il diritto minorile aveva vocazione ‘interdisciplinare’, nel poggiare soprattutto sul legame tra diritto e pedagogia; nel 1910 Orlando parlava all’Istituto pedago-gico forense di Milano del diritto‘da sempre e per sempre’ preminente per i minori, quello alla «protezione educativa», all’«educazione, siapure  for-zata».  Nell’Italia  liberale  era  ampio  il  dibattito  e  significativa  la  pro-gettazione; ne era un ‘ultimo atto’ il ProgettoFerri, inteso a distinguere tra bambini e adolescenti e a costruire una giustizia penale speciale rispetto a quella per gli adulti. Negli anni del fascismo –anche in questa materia tutt’al-tro  che  parentesi –era invece serrata la legislazione, con l’istituzione dell’Opera nazionale maternità e infanzia –attiva fino al 1975 –l’Opera na-zionale Balilla, il Tribunale per i minorenni (Rd. 1404/1934). Il regime inten-deva  marcare  il  passaggiodella  questione  minorile  dal  campo  penale  a quello «sociale»; era centrale la «rieducazione», come ribadito nel 1941 dal guardasigilli Dino Grandi. Il Rd. 140/1934 si ricollegava alla codificazione pe-nale e penal-processuale (1930), ed era ‘apripista’ della codificazione civile (1942). Nella dottrina degli anni Cinquanta l’«autonomia»del diritto minorile na-sceva con il Tribunale per i minori; cenni sporadici erano riservati alla Costi-tuzione  ed  alla  Dichiarazionedi  Ginevra  dei  diritti  universali  dei  bambini (1924). Pur in un orizzonte meramente esortatorio, in seguito le fonti inter-nazionali avrebbero avrebbero ‘incalzato’ il legislatore italiano,soprattutto sul piano, problematico, dell’attuazione dei principi. Il  diritto  minorile  si sviluppava inoltre come sorta di judge made law–costruito sopratutto dai presidenti del Tribunale dei minori, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone,  Occhiogrosso,  Fadiga –profilo  problematico  per  la  prevalente cultura giuridica legalista italiana, ostile all’ampio potere discrezionale, eser-citato dal giudice specializzato in materia giurisdizionale ed amministrativa. Nel 1951 nasceva inoltre l’Unione italiana giudici per minorenni, poi Associa-zione, motore del processo legislativo; nel 1971 era istituita la pianta orga-nica del «giudice specializzato».Il  diritto  minorile  era  complicato  dai  cambiamenti  di  costume,  che investivano  la  società:  nel  primoNovecento  il  dibattito tra  giuristi,  giudici, politici, scienziati sociali era iscritto nell’orizzonte della autorità,paterna e/o dello  Stato,  non  in  quello  della  libertà  ed  autonomia  del  minore.  Con  un cambio di prospettiva, all’Assemblea Costituente Aldo Moro tematizzava un diritto  «problematico»,  stante  l’incapacità  di  agire  del  soggetto,  ma «autentico». Quasi ad anticipare il best interest of the child, la legge 431/67 –detta  dell’adozione  speciale –attribuiva   al   Tribunale   il   compito   di «promuovere e difendere i diritti del minore». Elia –relatore di una densa sentenza  della  Consulta  del  1981 –sostenne che il “centro di gravità” del sistema passava dall’“interesse dall’adottante a quello dell’adottato”. Ma non    mancavano    problemi:    davanti    ai    concretissimi    drammi    sulla destinazione del bambino –madre sola e problematica o Istituto –Jemolo si chiedeva «dov’è l’interesse del minore», interrogativo a suo avviso non sciolto dalla legge, che aveva affidato al giudice «un compito che non è suo». Anche il mondo del diritto era lambito da nuove sensibilità e trasformazioni sociali: alla metà degli anni Settanta siponevail tema del «metodo», con la trasformazione  del  «diritto  minorile»,  da  «diritto  dei  minori  a  diritto  dei diritti dei minori». Con la riforma del diritto di famiglia del 1975 il «vecchio» diritto  minorile  pareva  destinato  a  lasciare  il  posto  ad  uno  «nuovo»;perAlfredo  Carlo  Moro  tramontava  il  soggetto  «unificato»,ed  entravano  in scena «Pierino, Maria»; alla luce della Convenzione internazionale dei diritti del fanciullo del 1989, ratificata in Italia due anni dopo, Moro affermava che il discorso sui «diritti» doveva poggiare sulla «attuazione». D’altro canto si osservava  che  il  legislatore  non  poteva  stabilire  per  legge  i  contenuti  dei diritti –primo di tutti quello all’educazione –se  non  con  criteri  generali  e astratti,   e   che   il  minore  non  era  considerato  dall’ordinamento  come soggetto di diritto, ma come destinatario di decisioni prese da altri, genitori, tutori, giudici. Nel 1970 Cividali metteva in scena un «giudice nuovo», impegnato a pro-muovere i diritti del minore, empatico con la «persona», più che intento ad applicare ‘freddamente’ la legge. La polarità tra il rispetto delle norme, a tu-tela di tuttii bambini, e la decisione nel migliore interessedi quelparticolare bambino, anche contravvenendo alla legge, irrompeva con il ‘caso celebre’ di Serena Cruz, tolta dal Tribunale per i minorenni di Torino alla famiglia, che l’aveva adottata illegalmente; quel ‘caso celebre’ metteva in scena il corto circuito tra legalità e «vera giustizia». Quanto al rapporto tra minori e istitu-zioni, intese alla rieducazione, la prassi mostra che, dal fascismo alla repub-blica, alla «discontinuità  politica»è  corrisposta  una «continuità  istituzio-nale», anche nella violenza esercitata sui minori; da qui una ‘provocazione’, la creazione di un «Tribunale per la difesa dei minori». Neppure il codice di procedura penale minorile del 1988, inteso a «educare responsabilizzando», è parso assicurare ai minorenni una efficace «garanzia».The juvenile question has been traced by historiography above all through the prism of repression and prevention; in twentieth-cen-tury Italy the need for social control, ""dominant thought"", has complicated the construction of the right for minors and minors. In fact, civil codification, ""adult-friendly"", assigned the rights to the rational and autonomous subject, as if to re-propose the liberal paternalism of Stuart Mill, about minors to be protected  in  the  first  place  by  themselves.  The  system  envisaged  minors above all to impose the ancient on it honors the father; even if the civil code of  1942  did  not  foresee  a  total  subjection  of  the  children  with  respect  to parental authority, before fascism and still in the fifties the parental author-ity was understood as 'remedy' to the inability to act of the child, obstacle to the action of the State in the order and disorder of the family. At the be-ginning of the century the ""legal protection of minors"" seemed ""unknown to our law and outside the law"", inadequate especially in the pitiless compari-son with European and overseas legislation; the comparison with a ‘happy elsewhere’ -first and foremost the Children Act of 1908 -would have been a constant in national policies for children and adolescents, from the Circular of the Minister of Justice V.E. Orlando to the Code Project for minors.Far from ‘specialism’ -a figure of the italian scientia iuris-the juvenile law had an ‘interdisciplinary’ figure, based above all on the link between law and pedagogy; in 1910 Orlando was speaking at the Milan Forensic Pedagogical Institute  of the  ""always  and forever""  pre-eminent  right for  minors, that of ""educational protection"", ""education, albeit forced"". In liberal Italy the plan-ning was significant and the debate was significant; the Ferri Project was a 'final act', intended to distinguish between children and adolescents and to build a special criminal justice system with respect to that for adults. In the years of fascism -even in this matter anything but parenthesis -legislation was tightened, with the institution of the Maternity and Childhood National Opera -active until 1975 -the Balilla National Opera, the Juvenile Court (Rd.1404/1934). The regime intended to mark the passage of the juvenile issue from the criminal to the ""social"" field; ""re-education"" was central, as reiter-ated in 1941 by the Minister of Justice Dino Grandi. Rd. 140/1934 was linked to the penal  and  penal-procedural  codification  (1930)  and  was  a  ""forerun-ner"" of civil codification (1942). In the doctrine of the 1950s the ""autonomy"" of juvenile law was born with the juvenile court; sporadic notes were reserved for the Constitution and the Geneva Declaration of Universal Children's Rights (1924). Despite a merely exhortatory  horizon,  the  international  sources  later  allegedly  ""urged""  the Italian legislator, above all on the problematic level of implementation of the principles.  The  juvenile  law  developed  as  a  sort  of  judge  made  law -built above all by the presidents of the juvenile court, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone, Occhiogrosso, Fadiga -problematic profile for the prevailing  legalistic  Italian  legal  culture,  hostile  to  the  wide  discretion, exercised  by  the  judge  specialized  in  jurisdictional  and  administrative matters. In 1951 the Italian Union of judges for minors was also born, then the  Association,  the  engine  of  the  legislative  process;  in  1971  the  organic plan of the ""specialized judge"" was established.The  juvenile  law  was  complicated  by  the  changes  of  custom,  which invested  the  society:  in  the  early  twentieth  century  the  debate  between jurists, judges, politicians, social scientists was inscribed in the horizon of the paternal and / or state authority, not in that of freedom and autonomy of the minor. With a change of perspective, at the Constituent Assembly Aldo Moro discussed a ""problematic"" right, given the subject's inability to act, but ""authentic"".  Asif  to  anticipate  the  best  interest  of  the  child,  law  431/67 -called  special  adoption -gave  the  Court  the  task  of  ""promoting  and defending  the  rights  of  the  child"".  Elia -who  was  the  speaker  of  a  dense sentence of the Consulta in 1981 -argued that the ""center of gravity"" of the system shifted ""from the interest of the adopter to the one adopted"". But there were problems: in front of the very real dramas about the destination of  the  child -single  and  problematic  mother  or  Institute -Jemolo  asked himself  ""where  is  the  minor's  interest"",  a  question  in  his  opinion  not dissolved by the law, which he had entrusted to the judge a task that is not his. Even  the  world  of  law  was  surrounded  by  new  sensitivities  and  social transformations:  in  the  mid-seventies  the  theme  of  the  ""method""  was posed,  with  the  transformation  of  the  ""juvenile  right"",  from  ""the  right  of minors to the rights of minors' rights"". With the family law reform of 1975, the ""old"" child law seemed destined to give way to a ""new"" one; for Alfredo Carlo Moro set the ""unified"" subject, and ""Pierino, Maria"" entered the scene; in the light of the 1989 International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified in Italy two years later, Moro affirmed that the discourse on ""rights"" had  to  rest  on  ""implementation"".  On  the  other  hand  it  was  observed  that the legislator could not establish by law the contents of the rights -first of all that to education -if not with general and abstract criteria, and that the minor was not considered by law as a subjectof right, but as a recipient of decisions made by others, parents, guardians, judges.In 1970 Cividali staged a ""new judge"", committed to promoting the rights of  the  child,  empathetic  with  the  ""person"",  rather  than  intent  on  applying the  law  ""coldly"".  Thepolarity  between  the  respect  of  the  rules,  for  the protection  of  all  children,  and  the  decision  in  the  best  interest  of  that particular  child,  even  in  contravention  of  the  law,  burst  with  the  'famous case' of Serena Cruz, removed by the Turin Juvenile Court to the family, who had  adopted  it  illegally;  that  ""celebrated  case""  staged  the  gap  between legality  and  ""true  justice"".  As  for  the  relationship  between  minors  and institutions, meant for re-education, the practice shows that, from fascism to the republic, political discontinuity is matched by institutional continuity, even  in  the  violence  exercised  on  minors;  hence  the  ""provocation"",  the creation of a ""Tribunal for the defense of minors"". Not even the 1988 Code of  Juvenile  Criminal  Procedure,  intended  to""educate  by  empowering"", seemed to ensure an effective ""guarantee"" for minors",multimedia,623,not included

This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology’s practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders—consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries—and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers’ needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers’ needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets. The study, being the first to explore real estate technologies, is limited by the number of research publications on the SRE technologies that has been compensated through incorporation of online reports",multimedia,624,not included

The new implementation, which is coded in C++ and takes advantage of the parallelization functionalities both on CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units), was validated using different benchmark cases and compared, in terms of numerical output and computational efficiency, with other well-known hydraulic software packages. Depending on the complexity of the specific test case, the new parallel implementation can achieve speedups up to two orders of magnitude when compared with the standard version. The speedup is especially remarkable for the GPU parallelization that uses Nvidia CUDA (compute unified device architecture). The efficiency is as good as the one provided by some of the most popular hydraulic models. We also present the application of Iber+ to model an extreme flash flood that took place in the Spanish Pyrenees in October 2012. The new implementation was used to simulate 24 h of real time in roughly eight minutes of computing time, while the standard version needed more than 15 h.

In fact, civil codification, ""adult-friendly"", assigned the rights to the rational and autonomous subject, as if to re-propose the liberal paternalism of Stuart Mill, about minors to be protected in the first place by themselves. The system envisaged minors above all to impose the ancient on it honors the father; even if the civil code of 1942 did not foresee a total subjection of the children with respect to parental authority, before fascism and still in the fifties the parental authority was understood as 'remedy' to the inability to act of the child, obstacle to the action of the State in the order and disorder of the family. At the beginning of the century the ""legal protection of minors"" seemed ""unknown to our law and outside the law"", inadequate especially in the pitiless comparison with European and overseas legislation; the comparison with a ‘happy elsewhere’ - first and foremost the Children Act of 1908 - would have been a constant in national policies for children and adolescents, from the Circular of the Minister of Justice V.E. Orlando to the Code Project for minors.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from ‘specialism’ - a figure of the italian scientia iuris - the juvenile law had an ‘interdisciplinary’ figure, based above all on the link between law and pedagogy; in 1910 Orlando was speaking at the Milan Forensic Pedagogical Institute of the ""always and forever"" pre-eminent right for minors, that of ""educational protection"", ""education, albeit forced"". In liberal Italy the planning was significant and the debate was significant; the Ferri Project was a 'final act', intended to distinguish between children and adolescents and to build a special criminal justice system with respect to that for adults. In the years of fascism - even in this matter anything but parenthesis - legislation was tightened, with the institution of the Maternity and Childhood National Opera - active until 1975 - the Balilla National Opera, the Juvenile Court (Rd . 1404/1934). The regime intended to mark the passage of the juvenile issue from the criminal to the ""social"" field; ""re-education"" was central, as reiterated in 1941 by the Minister of Justice Dino Grandi. Rd. 140/1934 was linked to the penal and penal-procedural codification (1930) and was a ""forerunner"" of civil codification (1942).
In the doctrine of the 1950s the ""autonomy"" of juvenile law was born with the juvenile court; sporadic notes were reserved for the Constitution and the Geneva Declaration of Universal Children's Rights (1924). Despite a merely exhortatory horizon, the international sources later allegedly ""urged"" the Italian legislator, above all on the problematic level of implementation of the principles. The juvenile law developed as a sort of judge made law - built above all by the presidents of the juvenile court, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone, Occhiogrosso, Fadiga - problematic profile for the prevailing legalistic Italian legal culture, hostile to the wide discretion, exercised by the judge specialized in jurisdictional and administrative matters. In 1951 the Italian Union of judges for minors was also born, then the Association, the engine of the legislative process; in 1971 the organic plan of the ""specialized judge"" was established.
The juvenile law was complicated by the changes of custom, which invested the society: in the early twentieth century the debate between jurists, judges, politicians, social scientists was inscribed in the horizon of the paternal and / or state authority, not in that of freedom and autonomy of the minor. With a change of perspective, at the Constituent Assembly Aldo Moro discussed a ""problematic"" right, given the subject's inability to act, but ""authentic"". As if to anticipate the best interest of the child, law 431/67 - called special adoption - gave the Court the task of ""promoting and defending the rights of the child"". Elia - who was the speaker of a dense sentence of the Consulta in 1981 - argued that the ""center of gravity"" of the system shifted ""from the interest of the adopter to the one adopted"". But there were problems: in front of the very real dramas about the destination of the child - single and problematic mother or Institute - Jemolo asked himself ""where is the minor's interest"", a question in his opinion not dissolved by the law, which he had entrusted to the judge a task that is not his. Even the world of law was surrounded by new sensitivities and social transformations: in the mid-seventies the theme of the ""method"" was posed, with the transformation of the ""juvenile right"", from ""the right of minors to the rights of minors' rights"". With the family law reform of 1975, the ""old"" child law seemed destined to give way to a ""new"" one; for Alfredo Carlo Moro set the ""unified"" subject, and ""Pierino, Maria"" entered the scene; in the light of the 1989 International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified in Italy two years later, Moro affirmed that the discourse on ""rights"" had to rest on ""implementation"". On the other hand it was observed that the legislator could not establish by law the contents of the rights - first of all that to education - if not with general and abstract criteria, and that the minor was not considered by law as a subject of right, but as a recipient of decisions made by others, parents, guardians, judges.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1970 Cividali staged a ""new judge"", committed to promoting the rights of the child, empathetic with the ""person"", rather than intent on applying the law ""coldly"". The polarity between the respect of the rules, for the protection of all children, and the decision in the best interest of that particular child, even in contravention of the law, burst with the 'famous case' of Serena Cruz, removed by the Turin Juvenile Court to the family, who had adopted it illegally; that ""celebrated case"" staged the gap between legality and ""true justice"". As for the relationship between minors and institutions, meant for re-education, the practice shows that, from fascism to the republic, political discontinuity is matched by institutional continuity, even in the violence exercised on minors; hence the ""provocation"", the creation of a ""Tribunal for the defense of minors"". Not even the 1988 Code of Juvenile Criminal Procedure, intended to ""educate by empowering"", seemed to ensure an effective ""guarantee"" for minors.La questione minorile è stata ripercorsa dalla storiografia soprattutto attraverso il prisma della repressione e prevenzione; nell’Italia del Novecento il bisogno di controllo sociale, ‘pensiero dominante’, ha complicato la costruzione del diritto per i minori e dei minori. La codificazione civile, ‘a misura di adulto’, assegnava infatti i diritti al soggetto razionale ed autonomo, quasi a riproporre l’impostazione del paternalismo liberale di Stuart Mill, a proposito di minori da proteggere in primo luogo da se stessi. L’ordinamento contemplava i minori soprattutto per imporgli l’‘antico onora il padre’;&nbsp;anche se il codice civile del 1942 non prevedeva una soggezione totale dei figli rispetto alla potestà genitoriale, prima del fascismo ed ancora negli anni Cinquanta la patria potestà era intesa come ‘rimedio’ all’incapacità di agire del figlio, ostacolo all’«azione dello Stato» nell’ordine e disordine della famiglia. Agli inizi del secolo la «protezione giuridica dei minorenni» pareva «sconosciuta al nostro diritto e fuori della legislazione», inadeguata soprattutto nell’impietoso paragone con la legislazione europea e d’oltreoceano; la comparazione con un ‘altrove felice’ – in primo luogo il Children Act del 1908 – sarebbe stata una costante nelle politiche nazionali per l’infanzia ed adolescenza, dalla Circolare del guardasigilli V.E. Orlando al Progetto di Codice per i minorenni.
Lontano dallo ‘specialismo’ – cifra della scientia iuris nazionale – il diritto minorile aveva vocazione ‘interdisciplinare’, nel poggiare soprattutto sul legame tra diritto e pedagogia; nel 1910 Orlando parlava all’Istituto pedagogico forense di Milano del diritto&nbsp; ‘da sempre e per sempre’ preminente per i minori, quello alla «protezione educativa», all’«educazione, sia pure forzata». Nell’Italia liberale era ampio il dibattito e significativa la progettazione; ne era un ‘ultimo atto’ il Progetto Ferri, inteso a distinguere tra bambini e adolescenti e a costruire una giustizia penale speciale rispetto a quella per gli adulti. Negli anni del fascismo – anche in questa materia tutt’altro che parentesi – era invece serrata la legislazione, con l’istituzione dell’Opera nazionale maternità e infanzia – attiva fino al 1975 – l’Opera nazionale Balilla, il Tribunale per i minorenni (Rd. 1404/1934). Il regime intendeva marcare il passaggio della questione minorile dal campo penale a quello «sociale»; era centrale la «rieducazione», come ribadito nel 1941 dal guardasigilli Dino Grandi. Il Rd. 140/1934 si ricollegava alla codificazione penale e penal-processuale (1930), ed era ‘apripista’ della codificazione civile (1942).
Nella dottrina degli anni Cinquanta l’«autonomia» del diritto minorile nasceva con il Tribunale per i minori; cenni sporadici erano riservati alla Costituzione ed alla Dichiarazione di Ginevra dei diritti universali dei bambini (1924). Pur in un orizzonte meramente esortatorio, in seguito le fonti internazionali avrebbero avrebbero ‘incalzato’ il legislatore italiano, soprattutto sul piano, problematico, dell’attuazione dei principi. Il diritto minorile si sviluppava inoltre come sorta di judge made law – costruito sopratutto dai presidenti del Tribunale dei minori, Radaelli, Baviera, Cividali, Meucci, Moro, Vercellone, Occhiogrosso, Fadiga – profilo problematico per la prevalente cultura giuridica legalista italiana, ostile all’ampio potere discrezionale, esercitato dal giudice specializzato in materia giurisdizionale ed amministrativa. Nel 1951 nasceva inoltre l’Unione italiana giudici per minorenni, poi Associazione, motore del processo legislativo; nel 1971 era istituita la pianta organica del «giudice specializzato».
Il diritto minorile era complicato dai cambiamenti di costume, che investivano la società: nel primo Novecento il dibattito tra giuristi, giudici, politici, scienziati sociali era iscritto nell’orizzonte della autorità, paterna e/o dello Stato, non in quello della libertà ed autonomia del minore. Con un cambio di prospettiva, all’Assemblea Costituente Aldo Moro tematizzava un diritto «problematico», stante l’incapacità di agire del soggetto, ma «autentico». Quasi ad anticipare il best interest of the child, la legge 431/67 – detta dell’adozione speciale – attribuiva al Tribunale il compito di «promuovere e difendere i diritti del minore». Elia – relatore di una densa sentenza della Consulta del 1981 – sostenne che il “centro di gravità” del sistema passava dall’“interesse dall’adottante a quello dell’adottato”. Ma non mancavano problemi: davanti ai concretissimi drammi sulla destinazione del bambino – madre sola e problematica o Istituto – Jemolo si chiedeva «dov’è l’interesse del minore», interrogativo a suo avviso non sciolto dalla legge, che aveva affidato al giudice «un compito che non è suo». Anche il mondo del diritto era lambito da nuove sensibilità e trasformazioni sociali: alla metà degli anni Settanta si poneva il tema del «metodo», con la trasformazione del «diritto minorile», da «diritto dei minori a diritto dei diritti dei minori». Con la riforma del diritto di famiglia del 1975 il «vecchio» diritto minorile pareva destinato a lasciare il posto ad uno «nuovo»;&nbsp; per Alfredo Carlo Moro tramontava il soggetto «unificato»,&nbsp;ed entravano in scena «Pierino, Maria»; alla luce della Convenzione internazionale dei diritti del fanciullo del 1989, ratificata in Italia due anni dopo, Moro affermava che il discorso sui «diritti» doveva poggiare sulla «attuazione». D’altro canto si osservava che il legislatore non poteva stabilire per legge i contenuti dei diritti – primo di tutti quello all’educazione – se non con criteri generali e astratti, e che il minore non era considerato dall’ordinamento come soggetto di diritto, ma come destinatario di decisioni prese da altri, genitori, tutori, giudici.
Nel 1970 Cividali metteva in scena un «giudice nuovo», impegnato a promuovere i diritti del minore, empatico con la «persona», più che intento ad applicare ‘freddamente’ la legge. La polarità tra il rispetto delle norme, a tutela di tutti i bambini, e la decisione nel migliore interesse di quel particolare bambino, anche contravvenendo alla legge, irrompeva con il ‘caso celebre’ di Serena Cruz, tolta dal Tribunale per i minorenni di Torino alla famiglia, che l’aveva adottata illegalmente; quel ‘caso celebre’ metteva in scena il corto circuito tra legalità e «vera giustizia». Quanto al rapporto tra minori e istituzioni, intese alla rieducazione, la prassi mostra che, dal fascismo alla repubblica, alla «discontinuità politica» è corrisposta una «continuità istituzionale», anche nella violenza esercitata sui minori; da qui una ‘provocazione’, la creazione di un «Tribunale per la difesa dei minori». Neppure il codice di procedura penale minorile del 1988, inteso a «educare responsabilizzando», è parso assicurare ai minorenni una efficace «garanzia»",multimedia,626,not included

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multi-neuronal spike pattern detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike latency, which enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and heterosynaptic plasticity, which allows the own regulation of synaptic weights. From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multi-dimensional, temporal, feature space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to experimental data obtained from a motor-inhibitory cognitive task. The results show that out method exhibits similar performance compared with other classification methods, indicating the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, its simplicity and low computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface, personal biometrics authentication, or early detection of diseases.GS acknowledges financial support by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (PTA-2015-10395-I).

One such animation technique that has been widely used in the animation and visual effects industry is called \u22rotoscoping\u22 and has allowed uniquely stylized animations to capture the motion of real life action sequences, however it is a very complex and time consuming process. Automating this arduous technique would free animators from performing frame by frame stylization and allow them to concentrate on their own artistic contributions. This thesis introduces a new artificial system based on an existing neural style transfer method which creates artistically stylized animations that simultaneously reproduce both the motion of the original videos that they are derived from and the unique style of a given artistic work. This system utilizes a convolutional neural network framework to extract a hierarchy of image features used for generating images that appear visually similar to a given artistic style while at the same time faithfully preserving temporal content. The use of optical flow allows the combination of style and content to be integrated directly with the apparent motion over frames of a video to produce smooth and visually appealing transitions. The implementation described in this thesis demonstrates how biologically-inspired systems such as convolutional neural networks are rapidly approaching human-level behavior in tasks that were once thought impossible for computers. Such a complex task elucidates the current and future technical and artistic capabilities of such biologically-inspired neural systems as their horizons expand exponentially. Further, this research provides unique insights into the way that humans perceive and utilize temporal information in everyday tasks. A secondary implementation that is explored in this thesis seeks to improve existing convolutional neural networks using a biological approach to the way these models adapt to their inputs. This implementation shows how these pattern recognition systems can be greatly improved by integrating recent neuroscience research into already biologically inspired systems. Such a novel hybrid activation function model replicates recent findings in the field of neuroscience and shows significant advantages over existing static activation functions",multimedia,628,not included

Places provide an environment for people to communicate, share perspectives, and in the process form new social connections. Due to the active role of places to the social fabric of city life, it is important to understand how people perceive and experience places. One fundamental construct that relates place and experience is ambiance, i.e., the impressions we ubiquitously form when we go out. Young people are key actors of urban life, specially at night, and as such play an equal role in co-creating and appropriating the urban space. Understanding how places and their youth inhabitants interact at night is a relevant urban issue. Until recently, our ability to assess the visual and perceptual qualities of urban spaces and to study the dynamics surrounding youth experiences in those spaces have been limited partly due to the lack of quantitative data. However, the growth of computational methods and tools including sensor-rich mobile devices, social multimedia platforms, and crowdsourcing tools have opened ways to measure urban perception at scale, and to deepen our understanding of nightlife as experienced by young people. In this thesis, as a first contribution, we present the design, implementation and computational analysis of four mobile crowdsensing studies involving youth populations from various countries to understand and infer phenomena related to urban places and people. We gathered a variety of explicit and implicit crowdsourced data including mobile sensor data and logs, survey responses, and multimedia content (images and videos) from hundreds of crowdworkers and thousands of users of mobile social networks. Second, we showed how crowdsensed images can be used for the computational characterization and analysis of urban perception in indoor and outdoor places. For both place types, urban perception impressions were elicited for several physical and psychological constructs using online crowdsourcing. Using low-level and deep learning features extracted from images, we automatically inferred crowdsourced judgments of indoor ambiance with a maximum R2 of 0.53 and outdoor perception with a maximum R2 of 0.49. Third, we demonstrated the feasibility to collect rich contextual data to study the physical mobility, activities, ambiance context, and social patterns of youth nightlife behavior. Fourth, using supervised machine learning techniques, we automatically classified drinking behavior of young people in an urban, real nightlife setting. Using features extracted from mobile sensor data and application logs, we obtained an overall accuracy of 76.7%. While this thesis contributes towards understanding urban perception and youth nightlife patterns in specific contexts, our research also contributes towards the computational understanding of urban places at scale with high spatial and temporal resolution, using a combination of mobile crowdsensing, social media, machine learning, multimedia analysis, and online crowdsourcing",multimedia,629,not included

data mining (SDM). It uses a multigene variant of the biologically inspired
machine learning method of genetic programming (MGGP) as the engine that drives
the automatic model discovery process. Symbolic data mining is the process of
extracting hidden, meaningful relationships from data in the form of symbolic
equations. In contrast to other data-mining methods, the structural
transparency of the generated predictive equations can give new insights into
the physical systems or processes that generated the data. Furthermore, this
transparency makes the models very easy to deploy outside of MATLAB. The
rationale behind GPTIPS is to reduce the technical barriers to using,
understanding, visualising and deploying GP based symbolic models of data,
whilst at the same time remaining highly customisable and delivering robust
numerical performance for power users. In this chapter, notable new features of
the latest version of the software are discussed with these aims in mind.
Additionally, a simplified variant of the MGGP high level gene crossover
mechanism is proposed. It is demonstrated that the new functionality of GPTIPS
2 (a) facilitates the discovery of compact symbolic relationships from data
using multiple approaches, e.g. using novel gene-centric visualisation analysis
to mitigate horizontal bloat and reduce complexity in multigene symbolic
regression models (b) provides numerous methods for visualising the properties
of symbolic models (c) emphasises the generation of graphically navigable
libraries of models that are optimal in terms of the Pareto trade off surface
of model performance and complexity and (d) expedites real world applications
by the simple, rapid and robust deployment of symbolic models outside the

For this purpose, biosensors using printed circuits composed from graphene microelectrodes using stabilized lipid membranes were constructed and developed.A number of particular methodologies were used to embody various receptors such as enzymes (urease and cholesterol oxidase) and an antibody (antibody D-dimer) in the sensors.Various physicochemical and instrumental methods of analysis, eg., differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectrophotometry, etc., were used to locate the position of the receptor (eg. antibody, enzyme, etc.) into the stabilized lipid membrane of the sensor and the mechanism of signal generation.The response of the sensor to various potentially toxic substrates eg. urea (urease immobilization), cholesterol (cholesterol oxidase immobilization) and D-dimer (immobilizing antibody D-dimer) and its stability with time were studied.For example, the response of urea biosensor towards various urea concentrations was found to have high sensitivity (ca. 70 mV/ concentration decade) over a range of urea concentrations between 1 Χ 10−6 Μ - 1 Χ 10−3 Μ. The response of cholesterol biosensor towards various concentrations of the substrate were also found to be highly sensitive (ca. 64 mV/ concentration decade) over a concentration range between 1 Χ 10−6 Μ - 1 Χ 10−3 Μ; this sensitivity is larger than those provided up to date in the literature. Finally the response of the D-dimer immunosensor was found satisfactory over a wide concentration range of analyte (10-6 μg/ mL - 10-3 μg/ mL) with a sensitivity of ca. 59 mV/ concentration decade with a rapid response of 15 s.The selectivity of the sensor construction method and on how to limit interferences were studied so that the sensor could be applied in real samples. The conditions for satisfactory stability and reproducibility of the chemical sensors were thoroughly studied and their construction into nanoscale was investigated.The results of the implementation of the constructed devices in real samples were satisfactory and show the possibility of construction of portable chemical sensors for the detection of toxicants for first time in the literature with many advantages, which can be used in the future as alternative systems instead of the time consuming, costly and complex chromatographic methods of analysis.Η παρούσα διατριβή εμβάθυνε για πρώτη φορά στην κατασκευή χημικών αισθητήρων για την ταχεία ανίχνευση τοξικών ουσιών.

Επίσης η απόκριση του αισθητήρα της χοληστερόλης σε διάφορες συγκεντρώσεις χοληστερόλης, βρέθηκε να παρουσιάζει υψηλή ευαισθησία (~64 mV/ δεκάδα συγκεντρώσεων) για μια ευρεία περιοχή συγκεντρώσεων της χοληστερόλης που κυμαινόταν από 1 Χ 10−6 Μ ως 1 Χ 10−3 Μ, και είναι καλύτερη από βιβλιογραφικά αναφερθέντες συσκευές βιοαισθητήρες χοληστερόλης. Τέλος η απόκριση του ανοσοαισθητήρα του D-dimer βρέθηκε ικανοποιητική για ένα ευρύ συγκέντρωσεων D-dimer (10-6 μg/ mL έως 10-3 μg/ mL) με ευαισθησία ~59 mV/ δεκάδα συγκεντρώσεων και με μια γρήγορη απόκριση 15s.Εν συνεχεία μελετήθηκε η εκλεκτικότητα της μεθόδου της κατασκευής των αισθητήρων και η άρση των παρεμποδίσεων για να εφαρμοστούν σε πραγματικά δείγματα.

This is achieved through analysis, modeling, implementation and simulation of artificial markets populated by software agents that represent economic self interested agents. Software agents are the constructs of a complex system, an artificial market that model a real existing market or an outline of a market design. The interest in simulating a market is multiple: exploiting existing market rules, searching for market design flaws and loopholes, and supporting decision making during a market mechanism design process. The main aim of the suggested approach is to analyze the behavior that emerges from the interaction of self interested agents acting in an artificial market. AEMAS (Artificial Economy MultiAgent System), a multiagent system architecture inspired by the Market Oriented Programming (MOP) approach is defined. In different economical sectors, e.g. energy markets, there is no consensus about which structures lead to social welfare maximization outcomes. An approach to find adequate architectures allows different market structure instances to be created and simulated, to ease the design and analysis of alternative structures. These alternatives can then be compared and potential design flaws eventually risen by simulation identified. Taking the electricity market as an example, two instances of the proposed architecture are presented, corresponding to the centralized dispatch arrangement common to non restructured markets, and the auction based pool, common to restructured markets.

Le présent mémoire résume les travaux de maîtrise réalisés dans l’optique de proposer une plateforme de déploiement et d’analyse d’algorithmes d’apprentissage appliqués aux animats. Les animats désignent des agents minimalement équipés aussi bien sur le plan mécanique qu’en termes de puissance de calcul. Néanmoins, la théorie gravitant autour de l’étude de ces entités vise à mettre en avant des méthodes d’apprentissages permettant à ceux-ci d’évoluer à partir de ce qu’ils auront appris de leur expérience dans l’environnement. À l’image des êtres vivants, les différences de perception du milieu environnant devraient permettre de voir naître des particularités et des comportements différents pour chacun d’entre eux. Par ailleurs, ces animats devraient avoir la faculté de pouvoir communiquer entre eux dans le but de permettre, s’ils le désirent, de pouvoir partager de l’information et de se servir d’une connaissance et d’un apprentissage communs pour assouvir ce qui devrait être leur principal objectif : survivre dans leur environnement. Le domaine de recherche des animats comprend aussi bien l’étude des animats simulés que celle des animats réels. Alors que le premier permet un déploiement facilité par l’abstraction rendue possible par les langages de haut niveau, la nécessité de devoir simuler un environnement avec l’ensemble de ses singularités induit une erreur de modélisation qui n’existe pas lorsque les animats sont physiquement réalisés. Par conséquent, si une telle plateforme était disponible, il serait alors seulement nécessaire de se concentrer sur les algorithmes d’apprentissage plutôt que sur des problèmes de modélisation. Par ailleurs, bien souvent, des algorithmes puissants lors des simulations se retrouvent inadaptés pour des problèmes réels de par le manque de fidélité entre l’environnement simulé et réel. Notamment, qu’adviendrait-il si un capteur devenait défectueux? Si une situation inconnue était rencontrée? Si le bruit ou la précision des capteurs avait mal été modélisés?Dans ce contexte, nous proposons d’étudier et de concevoir ce qui sera la base d’une plateforme de développement et d’analyse d’algorithmes d’apprentissage. À la différence des plateformes existantes, la principale originalité de cette plateforme réside dans la prise en compte des problèmes énergétiques. En effet, pour pouvoir survivre l’animat devrait être capable d’estimer et de prévoir ses dépenses énergétiques présentes et futures et de les prendre en considération dans le choix des tâches à effectuer.----------ABSTRACT This master’s thesis summarizes the achievements realized towards proposing a platform for deployment and analysis of machine learning algorithms applied to animats. Animats are agents minimally equipped on the mechanical plan as well as in terms of computing power. Nevertheless, the theory describing the study of these entities aims at discovering learning methods allowing them to evolve using what they learnt from their experience in the environment. Just like human beings, differences in perception of the surrounding environment should allow peculiarities and several behaviors for each of them. Besides, these animats should be able to communicate between them so as to allow, if needed, to share information and to use common knowledge and learning in order to succeed in what should be their main objective: survive in their environment. 
The research field of animats includes the study of simulated and real animats. While the former allows a facilitated deployment due to the abstraction made possible by high-level languages, the necessity to emulate an environment with all peculiarities can lead to modeling errors that may be avoided when animats are physically built. Consequently, if such a platform was available, it would only be necessary to focus on the learning algorithms rather than on the modelling problems. Besides, very often, powerful algorithms tested on simulation may prove themselves unsuitable for real problems in real environments. For instance, it is hard to predict what would happen if a sensor became defective, if an unexpected situation was met, or if the noise or the precision of the sensors was not properly modeled.In this context, we suggest studying and designing what will be the base of a platform for development and analysis of learning algorithms. Unlike the existing platforms, the main originality of this platform lies in the consideration of energy constraints. Indeed, to enhance its survivability, the animat should be able to estimate and to plan its present and future energy consumption and to consider it in the choices made. Besides, the objective was to design an animat sufficiently equipped to realize simple tasks but relatively primitive to make it necessary to take advantage of algorithmic parades, like for example the pooling of information. Therefore, the computing power embedded in the animat was purposely reduced to force the relocation of processing that proves too complex. On the other hand, a reduced size and a moderate price are necessary features to enable deployment of a colony of animats",multimedia,637,not included

Such dialogue systems must not only understand student speech, but must also endeavor to keep students engaged while scaffolding them through the curriculum. Crafting robust, natural tutoring interactions typically involves writing tightly scripted behaviors for a wide variety of student responses and scenarios.
Combining statistical machine learning with corpus-based methods in natural language processing presents a possible path to reducing this effort. Advances in reinforcement learning have been applied toward dialogue systems to learn optimal behaviors for a given task. However, these learned dialogue policies are tightly coupled to the specific dialogue system implementation. For content-rich applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, there is an immediate need to learn tutoring strategies and dialogue behaviors that can be leveraged across a variety of materials, concepts and lessons. Further generalization will require an intermediate representation of dialogue that can abstract the conversation to its underlying action, function, and content.
This work introduces the Dialogue Schema Unifying Speech and Semantics (DISCUSS), an intermediate linguistic representation that captures the semantics and pragmatics of speech while also allowing for domain-independent modeling of tutorial dialogue. To better understand the benefits of the DISCUSS representation, a corpus of computer-mediated tutorial dialogues was manually tagged with DISCUSS labels. These data were then used for three different tasks: utterance classification, dialogue move selection, and learning gains prediction.
System performance in these tasks demonstrate the utility and viability of the DISCUSS representation for analyzing and automating dialogue interactions. Utterance classifiers achieve DISCUSS labeling performance on par with inter-annotator agreement levels. System performance in ranking and selecting follow-up questions illustrates the usefulness of DISCUSS-based features for modeling and identifying the factors behind human decision making when teaching. Correlating features of the dialogue with measured learning gains in students shows how DISCUSS-derived metrics provide a detailed account of real tutoring strategies and student behaviors. Together these results represent a step toward more domain-independent mechanisms for modeling dialogue",multimedia,638,not included

In particolare l’attenzione è rivolta sul fatto che la lingua della comunicazione digitale costituisce una varietà linguistica dal confronto con la quale l’insegnamento di una L2 non può ormai prescindere, e che le tecnologie digitali della comunicazione, se correttamente adottate fuori e dentro la classe, consentono di ridurre il confine tra apprendimento guidato e acquisizione spontanea di una lingua seconda. Filo conduttore della riflessione è il concetto di “competenza comunicativa digitale”, che si aggiunge alle componenti della competenza linguistico-comunicativa indicate dal Quadro Comune Europeo di Riferimento per le Lingue. Nella seconda parte del lavoro, dal taglio più didattico, si presenta una serie di strumenti e di esperienze di insegnamento/apprendimento della L2 con l’uso delle tecnologie digitali.

The underlying theme is the concept of “digital communicative competence”, added to linguistic and communicative competences indicated by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

However, to develop well defined software and hardware based criteria in the application of pattern recognition problems, is possible. The aim of classification can be defined as to assign an unknown object to a class containing similar objects (or to distinguish objects having the same properties from those not possessing). Classification is especially important in the real world applications or in the digital world. Basic classification methods using nearest neighbourhood algorithm have first been seen in early sixties under the subject tile"" pattern recognition.""  Classification is used in a huge variety of applications such as automatic target identification, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence, template matching, pattern recognition, analog to digital converters, quantization, medical diagnosis, statistics etc. Therefore nowadays, be it in the real or digital world, data classification is becoming increasingly important. But until recently, major work on classification was on developing algorithms used in software packages whereas, in many applications it is becoming more and more important to classify data much faster and in real time, entailing the need for hardware realization of these algorithms. Software approaches are not practical for real time applications, the processing is computationally very expensive, consuming a lot of Central Processing Unit (CPU) time when implemented as software running on general purpose computers. So in literature hardware implementation of classifier topologies become necessary. Also in literature hardware realized classifiers which are designed to work in low power operation; moreover some of these hardware classifiers do not have custom tunability. So they can only be used for a specific application. The recent developments in electronics technology has created a perfect medium for the hardware realization of classifier structures which, in turn, will render many classifier application prospects feasible in real time. This paper targets the design and application to real world problems of tunable, low power new classifier circuits using CMOS technology. So, a low-power CMOS implementation of a multi-input data classifier with several output levels is presented. The proposed circuit operates in current-mode and can classify several types of analog vector data. An architecture is developed comprising a threshold circuit based on CMOS transistors operating in subthreshold region. To this purpose a one dimensional classifier, called core circuit is proposed. The core circuit also works as a one-dimensional classifier. As this circuit is designed to operate in current-mode the input and the output data is provided to the core circuit with currents. So by interconnecting several core circuits and adding the output currents a multi output classifier can be obtained. Also, com-bining several core circuits in groups in such a way that each group has identical input current (different from the others), a multi-dimensional, multi-level output classifier can be obtained. Also, numerous efforts in balancing the trade off between power consumption, area and speed have resulted in an acceptable performance. On the other hand, the rapid increasing use of battery operated portable equipment in application areas such as telecommunications and medical electronics increases the importance of low-power and small sized VLSI circuits' technologies. One solution to achieve low-power and acceptable performance is to operate the transistors in the subthreshold region. The CMOS transistors working in subthreshold region are suitable only for specific applications which need, not very high performance, but low power consumption.The primary aim of this paper is to develop a low power classifier circuit with n inputs and externally tunable decision regions with different output amplitude for each region. Due to the subthreshold operation of the transistors in the proposed core circuit, very low power consumption becomes possible. The proposed core circuit is constructed with two threshold and a subtractor circuit. The SPICE simulation of the threshold circuit, core circuit, one dimensional and two dimensional classifier circuits are given. Using 0.35 µm parameters of AMS CMOS technology, SPICE simulations are performed and a  low-power, custom tunable classifier circuit is  realized. Because of the parallel processing characteristic of the circuit, it is well suited for real-world applications. Keywords: Classifier circuits, CMOS, current-mode, low-power",multimedia,640,not included

While it suffices to consider the propositional case for investigating general properties and the overall behavior of a semantics, we feel that for real applications and for computational purposes an implementation should be able to handle first-order programs without grounding them. In this paper we present a theoretical framework by defining a calculus of program transformations that apply directly to rules with variables and function symbols. Our main results are that (a) this calculus is weakly confluent for arbitrary programs (i.e., it has the normal form property), (b) it is weakly terminating for Datalog ∨,¬ programs, (c) for finite ground programs it is equivalent to a weakly terminating calculus introduced by Brass and Dix (S.Brass, J.Dix, in: J.Dix, L.Pereira, T.Przymusinski (Eds.), Non-monotonic Extensions of Logic Programming, Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, Vol.927, Springer, Berlin, 1995, pp. 127–155), and (d) it approximates a generalization of Disjunctive Well-founded semantics (D-WFS) for arbitrary programs. We achieve this by transforming program rules into rules with equational constraints thereby using heavily methods and techniques from constraint logic programming (CLP). In particular, disconnection-methods play a crucial role. In principle, any constraint theory known from CLP can be exploited in the context of non-monotonic reasoning, not only equational constraints over the Herbrand domain. However, the respective constraint solver must be able to treat negative constraints of the considered constraint domain. In summary, this work yields the basis for a general combination of two paradigms: constraint logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning",multimedia,641,not included

The proposed model is aimed at solving prediction and inference problems. The implementation introduced in this work allows learning from data batches without the need of keeping them in memory afterwards. The learning architecture is built using Incremental Gaussian Mixture Models. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm and general geometric properties of Gaussian distributions are used to train the models.

The major challenges of ATR in SAR stem from severe data scarcity and great variation of SAR images. Recent work started to adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which, however, remain unable to handle the aforementioned challenges due to their high dependency on large quantities of data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional learning architecture, called Multi-Stream CNN (MS-CNN), for ATR in SAR by leveraging SAR images from multiple views. Specifically, we deploy a multi-input architecture that fuses information from multiple views of the same target in different aspects; therefore, the elaborated multi-view design of MS-CNN enables it to make full use of limited SAR image data to improve recognition performance. We design a Fourier feature fusion framework derived from kernel approximation based on random Fourier features which allows us to unravel the highly nonlinear relationship between images and classes. More importantly, MS-CNN is qualified with the desired characteristic of easy and quick manoeuvrability in real SAR ATR scenarios, because it only needs to acquire real-time GPS information from airborne SAR to calculate aspect differences used for constructing testing samples. The effectiveness and generalization ability of MS-CNN have been demonstrated by extensive experiments under both the Standard Operating Condition (SOC) and Extended Operating Condition (EOC) on the MSTAR dataset. Experimental results have shown that our proposed MS-CNN can achieve high recognition rates and outperform other state-of-the-art ATR methods.",multimedia,644,not included

The main goal of this article is to describe the designed and implemented algorithm for the automatic identification of the character string of billets on the rolling mill. The algorithm allows the conversion of image information from the front of the billet, which enters the rolling process, into a string of characters, which is further used to control the technological process. The purpose of this identification is to prevent the input pieces from being confused because different parameters of the rolling process are set for different pieces. In solving this task, it was necessary to design the optimal technical equipment for image capture, choose the appropriate lighting, search for text and recognize individual symbols, and insert them into the control system. The research methodology is based on the empirical-quantitative principle, the basis of which is the analysis of experimentally obtained data (photographs of billet faces) in real operating conditions leading to their interpretation (transformation into the shape of a digital chain). The first part of the article briefly describes the billet identification system from the point of view of technology and hardware resources. The next parts are devoted to the main parts of the algorithm of automatic identification—optical recognition of strings and recognition of individual characters of the chain using artificial intelligence. The method of optical character recognition using artificial neural networks is the basic algorithm of the system of automatic identification of billets and eliminates ambiguities during their further processing. Successful implementation of the automatic inspection system will increase the share of operation automation and lead to ensuring automatic inspection of steel billets according to the production plan. This issue is related to the trend of digitization of individual technological processes in metallurgy and also to the social sustainability of processes, which means the elimination of human errors in the management of the billet rolling process.",multimedia,646,not included

The algorithms, software, and hardware that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are, as a result, generally not effective for massive-scale sparse graphs from the real world due to their complexity and irregularity. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we combine the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) with a modern FPGA in order to achieve exceptional random access performance without any loss of flexibility or efficiency in computation. In particular, we develop collaborative software/hardware techniques to perform a level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on the FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that fully exploits the platform's capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. For each input graph, this algorithm provides an efficient data layout that allows the FPGA to coalesce memory requests into the largest possible HMC payload requests so that the number of memory requests, which is the primary factor in runtime, can be minimized. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by adding a merging unit. The merging unit takes the best advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluated the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications.

In this paper, to combine these efforts, we present an “access-averse” framework which encapsulates some of the existing algorithms for computing a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). This framework not only allows us to develop software whose performance can be tuned based on domain specific knowledge, but it also allows a user from one discipline to test an algorithm from another, or to combine the techniques from different algorithms. To demonstrate this potential, we implement the framework on multicore CPUs with multiple GPUs and compare the performance of two representative algorithms, blocked variants of matrix power and Lanczos methods. Our performance studies with large-scale graphs from real applications demonstrate that, when combined with communication-avoiding and thick-restarting techniques, the Lanczos method can be competitive with the power method, which is one of the most popular methods currently used for these applications. InIn addition, though we only focus on the truncated SVDs, the two computational kernels used in our studies, the sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiply and tall-skinny QR factorization, are fundamental building blocks for computing low-rank approximations with other objectives.

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost.",science,656,not included

Computational solutions for automatic bias and sensationalism detection for news articles can have tremendous impact if used in the right way. Because news is an ever-shifting domain, concept drift is an issue that must be dealt with in any real-world computational news classification system that relies on features and trained machine learning models. Yet, an empirical study of concept drift in such systems, especially popular systems released recently as open-source and used within organizations, has been lacking thus far. This short paper reports results on an empirical study specifically designed to assess concept drift, using an open-source, popular computational news classification system, on real news data crawled from the Web. We find that even a gap of two years (2017 vs. 2019) can lead to significant concept drift, a far narrower gap than observed in traditional machine learning domains, making deployment of pre-trained or openly available computational news classification models an ethically suspect issue.",science,665,not included

To explore the multiple pheromones mechanism which enable robots to solve complex collective tasks efficiently, we introduce an artificial multiple pheromone system (ColCOS<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Phi $ </tex-math></inline-formula>) to support swarm intelligence research by enabling multiple robots to deploy and react to multiple pheromones simultaneously.

The color sensors beneath the robots can detect and identify lingering “pheromones” on the screen. Meanwhile, the release of any pheromone from each robot is enabled by monitoring its positional information over time with an overhead camera. No other communication methods apart from virtual pheromones are employed in this system.

Materials and methods Using Twitter search features, all tweets containing keywords from both “radiology” and “COVID-19” were collected for the period January 01, 2020 up to April 24, 2020. The resulting dataset comprised of 8354 tweets. Images were classified as (i) images with text (ii) radiological content (e.g., CT scan snapshots, X-ray images), and (iii) non-medical content like personal images or memes. We trained our deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on training dataset of 1040 labeled images drawn from all three classes. We then trained another DL classifier for segmenting images into categories based on human anatomy. All software used is open-source and adapted for this research. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was assessed by comparing results on a test set of 1885 images. Results Our analysis shows that in COVID-19 related tweets on radiology, nearly 32% had textual images, another 24% had radiological content, and 44% were not of radiological significance. Our results indicated a 92% accuracy in classifying images originally labeled as chest X-ray or chest CT and a nearly 99% accurate classification of images containing medically relevant text. With larger training dataset and algorithmic tweaks, the accuracy can be further improved. Conclusion Applying DL on rich textual images and other metadata in tweets we can process and classify content for radiological significance in real time.",science,673,not included

self-calibrating combinations of speckles which are resistant to phase noise,

we reanalyze Palomar adaptive optics observations of the binary alpha Ophiuchi,

However, some parameters in the model may not be routinely measured in Superpave system, which restricts the use of the prediction model. In addition, new additives and recycling materials such as reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) have been extensively used in recent years and shown to have significant effect on the low-temperature cracking resistance of asphalt mixture. However, the effects have not been considered in the existing D(t) prediction models. Hence, the objective of this study is to develop models with significantly high accuracy to predict the D(t) of asphalt mixtures containing RAP. A total of 1890 sets of data points were collected from three different research projects. A Pearson correlation analysis was carried out to select the input parameters which are most influential to D(t). Two prediction models (i.e., multiple linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models) were proposed. A comprehensive analysis on the prediction accuracy and reasonability of the proposed models was conducted.

One of the main drawbacks of such approaches is the lack of a rigorous frame based on the laws of physics. This may render physically inconsistent the predictions of a trained network, which can be even dangerous for real applications.
                  Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks for constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material point level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the network’s architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to compute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In this way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their relation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the architecture of TANNs. Consequently, our approach does not have to identify the underlying pattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large data-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the predictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain thermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features, TANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling with neural networks.
                  We demonstrate the wide applicability of TANNs for modeling elasto-plastic materials, using both hyper- and hypo-plasticity models. Strain hardening and softening are also considered for the hyper-plastic scenario. Detailed comparisons show that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs. Finally, we demonstrate that the implementation of the laws of thermodynamics confers to TANNs high robustness in the presence of noise in the training data, compared to standard approaches.

                  A total of 154 patients were treated with the ViewRay MRIdian system between September 2018 and October 2019. The time process of MRgRT workflow steps of 962 fractions for 166 treatment sites was analyzed in terms of patient and online adaptive treatment (ART) characteristics.
               
                  Results
                  Overall, 774 of 962 fractions were treated with online ART, and 83.2% of adaptive fractions were completed in less than 60 minutes. Sixty-three percent, 50.3%, and 4.2% of fractions were completed in less than 50 minutes, 45 minutes, and 30 minutes, respectively. Eight-point-three percent and 3% of fractions were completed in more than 70 minutes and 80 minutes, respectively. The median time (tmed) for ART workflow steps were as follows: (1) setup tmed: 5.0 minutes, (2) low-resolution scanning tmed: 1 minute, (3) high-resolution scanning tmed: 3 minutes, (4) online contouring tmed: 9 minutes, (5) reoptimization with online quality assurance tmed: 5 minutes, (6) real targeting tmed: 3 minutes, (7) beam delivery with gating tmed: 17 minutes, and (8) net total treatment time tmed: 45 minutes.

The implementation of PL-based sensing schemes combining multiple QDs of different nature, excited at the same wavelength and emitting at different ones, allowed to obtain a specific analyte-response profile. The first-order fluorescence data obtained from the whole emission spectra of the CdTe/AgInS2 combined nanoprobe upon interaction with folic acid and Fe(II) were processed by using chemometric tools, namely partial least-squares (PLS) and artificial neural network (ANN).

Most detection mechanisms attempt to classify user accounts as real (i.e., benign, honest) or fake (i.e., malicious, Sybil) by analyzing either user-level activities or graph-level structures. These mechanisms, however, are not robust against adversarial attacks in which fake accounts cloak their operation with patterns resembling real user behavior.
                  In this article, we show that victims – real accounts whose users have accepted friend requests sent by fakes – form a distinct classification category that is useful for designing robust detection mechanisms. In particular, we present Íntegro – a robust and scalable defense system that leverages victim classification to rank most real accounts higher than fakes, so that OSN operators can take actions against low-ranking fake accounts. Íntegro starts by identifying potential victims from user-level activities using supervised machine learning. After that, it annotates the graph by assigning lower weights to edges incident to potential victims. Finally, Íntegro ranks user accounts based on the landing probability of a short random walk that starts from a known real account. As this walk is unlikely to traverse low-weight edges in a few steps and land on fakes, Íntegro achieves the desired ranking.
                  We implemented Íntegro using widely-used, open-source distributed computing platforms, where it scaled nearly linearly. We evaluated Íntegro against SybilRank, which is the state-of-the-art in fake account detection, using real-world datasets and a large-scale deployment at Tuenti – the largest OSN in Spain with more than 15 million active users. We show that Íntegro significantly outperforms SybilRank in user ranking quality, with the only requirement that the employed victim classifier is better than random.

Thus, it is critical to process massive amounts of data to retrieve knowledge. The existing software and automated tools to handle big data sets are not sufficient. As a result, an expandable mining technique that enfolds the large storage and processing capability of distributed or parallel processing platforms is essential.

The pivotal objective of this work is to illustrate real training data sets with reduced amount of elements or instances. These reduced amounts of data sets will ensure faster data classification and standard storage management with less sensitivity.

As load changes throughout the day and the year, electricity systems must be able to deliver the maximum load at all times, which will be hard trade for a practical power network. Smart grid technologies show strong potential to optimize asset utilization by shifting peak load to off peak times, thereby decoupling the electricity growth from peak load growth. Under Smart grid trade regulation, with continuous varying demand pattern, electricity price will be uneven as well. On this view point, in order to obtain a flatten demand, without affecting the welfare of the market participants, this paper presents an on-going effort to develop Demand Response (DR) governed swarm intelligence based stochastic peak load modeling methodology capable of restoring the market equilibrium during price and demand oscillations of the real-time smart power networks. This proposed DR based methodology allows generators and loads to interact in an automated fashion in real time, coordinating demand to flatten spikes and thereby minimizing erratic variations of price of electricity. For proper utilization of DR connectivity, a Curtailment Limiting Index (CLI) has been formulated, monitoring which in real time, for each of the Load Dispatch Centers (LDCs), the system operator can shape the electricity demand according to the available capacity of generation, transmission and distribution assets. The proposed methodology can also be highlighted for generating the most economical schedule for social welfare with standard operational status in terms of voltage profile, system loss and optimal load curtailment. The case study has been carried out in IEEE 30 bus scenario as well as on a practical 203 bus-265 line power network (Indian Eastern Grid) with both generator characteristics and price responsive demand characteristics or DR as inputs and illustrious Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has assisted the fusion of the proposed model and methodology. Encouraging simulation results suggest that, the effective deployment of this methodology may lead to an operating condition where an overall benefit of all the power market participants with standard operational status can be ensured and the misuse of electricity will be minimized.",science,704,not included

To gain more insights on workflows we introduce a lightweight workflow monitoring infrastructure, WOW-MON (WOrkfloW MONitor), which enables user's access not only to cross-application performance data such as end-to-end latency and execution time of individual workflow components at runtime, but also to customized performance events. To reduce profiling overhead, WOW-MON uses adaptive selection of performance metrics based on machine learning algorithms to guide profilers collecting only metrics that have most impact on performance of workflows. Through the study of real scientific workflows (e.g., LAMMPS) with the help of WOWMON, we found that the performance of the workflows can be significantly affected by both software and hardware factors, such as the policy of process mapping and in-situ buffer size. Moreover, we experimentally show that WOWMON can reduce data movement for profiling by up to 54% without missing the key metrics for performance debugging.",science,705,not included

They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as ∼1% for simulated and ∼2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely thousands of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as a user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort.

Everyday social experience involves “confidence” among people, which can be interpreted at the neurological level of a human brain. Recent studies suggest that oxytocin is a centrally-acting neurotransmitter important in the development and alteration of trust. Its administration in humans seems to increase trust and reduce fear, in part by directly inhibiting the amygdala. However, the cerebral microcircuitry underlying this mechanism is still unknown. We propose the first biologically realistic model for trust, simulating spiking neurons in the cortex in a real-time human–robot interaction simulation. At the physiological level, oxytocin cells were modeled with triple apical dendrites characteristic of their structure in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. As trust was established in the simulation, this architecture had a direct inhibitory effect on the amygdala tonic firing, which resulted in a willingness to exchange an object from the trustor (virtual neurorobot) to the trustee (human actor). Our software and hardware enhancements allowed the simulation of almost 100,000 neurons in real time and the incorporation of a sophisticated Gabor mechanism as a visual filter.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects.publishersversionpublishe",science,713,not included

Yet decisions and the underlying principles of decision-making have been difficult to integrate into the classical population-level models of ecology. Certainly, there is a long history of modeling individuals’ searching behavior, diet selection, or conflict dynamics within social interactions. When all individuals are given certain simple rules to govern their decision-making processes, the resultant population–level models have yielded important generalizations and theory. But it is also recognized that such models do not represent the way real individuals decide on actions. Factors that influence a decision include the organism’s environment with its dynamic rewards and risks, the complex internal state of the organism, and its imperfect knowledge of the environment. In the case of animals, it may also involve complex social factors, and experience and learning, which vary among individuals. The way that all factors are weighed and processed to lead to decisions is a major area of behavioral theory. While classic population-level modeling is limited in its ability to integrate decision-making in its actual complexity, the development of individual- or agent-based models (IBM/ABMs) (we use ABM throughout to designate both ‘agent-based modeling’ and an ‘agent-based model’) has opened the possibility of describing the way that decisions are made, and their effects, in minute detail. Over the years, these models have increased in size and complexity. Current ABMs can simulate thousands of individuals in realistic environments, and with highly detailed internal physiology, perception and ability to process the perceptions and make decisions based on those and their internal states. The implementation of decision-making in ABMs ranges from fairly simple to highly complex; the process of an individual deciding on an action can occur through the use of logical and simple (if-then) rules to more sophisticated neural networks and genetic algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the ways in which decisions are integrated into a variety of ABMs and to give a prospectus on the future of modeling of decisions in ABMs.",science,720,not included

These missing values can significantly affect subsequent statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms so there is a strong motivation to estimate these values as accurately as possible before using these algorithms. While many imputation algorithms have been proposed, more robust techniques need to be developed so that further analysis of biological data can be accurately undertaken. In this paper, an innovative missing value imputation algorithm called collateral missing value estimation (CMVE) is presented which uses multiple covariance-based imputation matrices for the final prediction of missing values. The matrices are computed and optimized using least square regression and linear programming methods.

Results: The new CMVE algorithm has been compared with existing estimation techniques including Bayesian principal component analysis imputation (BPCA), least square impute (LSImpute) and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). All these methods were rigorously tested to estimate missing values in three separate non-time series (ovarian cancer based) and one time series (yeast sporulation) dataset. Each method was quantitatively analyzed using the normalized root mean square (NRMS) error measure, covering a wide range of randomly introduced missing value probabilities from 0.01 to 0.2. Experiments were also undertaken on the yeast dataset, which comprised 1.7% actual missing values, to test the hypothesis that CMVE performed better not only for randomly occurring but also for a real distribution of missing values. The results confirmed that CMVE consistently demonstrated superior and robust estimation capability of missing values compared with other methods for both series types of data, for the same order of computational complexity. A concise theoretical framework has also been formulated to validate the improved performance of the CMVE algorithm.

The knowledge of what is in front of the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or planning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class label and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to the robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for addressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the integration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often difficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several high-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and training. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this fragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the semantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the training of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and the intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real robotic platform. Thus, we do not propose a new CNN approach in this paper. Instead, we provide a stable and easy-to-use tool to make this technology more approachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at closing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics research. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment. The training interface is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and the deployment interface provides C++ library that can be easily integrated in an existing robotics codebase, a ROS node, and two standalone applications for label prediction in images and videos.",robotics,722,included

SEAL is a research project aimed at developing Home Automation (HA) solutions for building energy management, user customization and improved safety of its inhabitants. One of the main problems of HA systems is the wide range of communication standards that commercial devices use. Usually this forces the designer to choose devices from a few brands, limiting the scope of the system and its capabilities. In this context, SmartSEAL is a framework that aims to integrate heterogeneous devices, such as sensors and actuators from different vendors, providing networking features, protocols and interfaces that are easy to implement and dynamically configurable. The core of our system is a Robotics middleware called Robot Operating System (ROS). We adapted the ROS features to the HA problem, designing the network and protocol architectures for this particular needs. These software infrastructure allows for complex HA functions that could be realized only levering the services provided by different devices. The system has been tested in our laboratory and installed in two real environments, Palazzo Fogazzaro in Schio and “Le Case” childhood school in Malo.

However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-learning to learn the shortest path on the building model’s graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actor–critic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces. Hence, our model achieves near optimal performance on the real world emergency environment.",robotics,736,included

For this quality they are being used in varying circumstances which humans cannot control. Rovers are special robots, capable of traversing through areas that are too difficult for humans. Even though it is a robust bot, lack of proper intelligence and automation are its basic shortcomings. As the main purpose of a rover is to traverse through areas of extreme difficulties, therefore an intelligent path generation and following system is highly required. Our research work aimed at developing an algorithm for autonomous path generation using GPS (Global Positioning System) based coordinate system and implementation of this algorithm in real life terrain, which in our case is MDRS, Utah, USA. Our prime focus was the development of a robust but easy to implement system. After developing such system, we have been able to successfully traverse our rover through that difficult terrain. It uses GPS coordinates of target points that will be fed into the rover from a control station. The rover capturing its own GPS signal generates a path between the current location and the destination location on its own. It then finds the deviation in its current course of direction and position. And eventually it uses Proportional Integral Derivative control loop feedback mechanism (PID control algorithm) for compensating the error or deviation and thus following that path and reach destination. A low cost on board computer (Raspberry Pi in our case) handles all the calculations during the process and drives the rover fulfilling its task using an microcontroller (Arduino).",robotics,747,included

We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map.

We present a novel Neural Net based policy, NavNet, which allows for easy deployment on a real robot. It consists of two sub policies - a high level policy which can understand real images and perform long range planning expressed in high level commands; a low level policy that can translate the long range plan into low level commands on a specific platform in a safe and robust manner. For every new deployment, the high level policy is trained on an easily obtainable scan of the environment modeling its visuals and layout. We detail the design of such an environment and how one can use it for training a final navigation policy. Further, we demonstrate a learned low-level policy.

This algorithm is quite popular within the robotics community for the production of trained neural networks without having to determine a priori their size and topology. The main drawback of the traditional NEAT algorithm is that, even though it can implement recurrent synaptic connections, which allow it to perform some time related processing tasks, its capabilities are rather limited, especially when dealing with precise time dependent phenomena. NEAT’s ability to capture the underlying dynamics that correspond to complex time series still has a lot of room for improvement. To address this issue, the paper describes a new implementation of the NEAT algorithm that is able to generate artificial neural networks (ANNs) with trainable time delayed synapses in addition to its previous capacities. We show that this approach, called $$\uptau $$ τ -NEAT improves the behavior of the neural networks obtained when dealing with complex time related processes.

Empirical trials suggest that tree-based search methods are the most efficient when the path limit is short, but do not scale well when the path length increases.

Those tasks can be either explicitly programmed by an engineer or learned by means of some automatic learning method, which improves the adaptability of the robot and reduces the effort of setting it up. In this sense, reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized as a promising tool for a machine to learn autonomously how to do tasks that are specified in a relatively simple manner. However, the dependency between these methods and the particular task to learn is a well-known problem that has strongly restricted practical implementations in robotics so far. Breaking this barrier would have a significant impact on these and other intelligent systems; in particular, having a core method that requires little tuning effort for being applicable to diverse tasks would boost their autonomy in learning and self-adaptation capabilities. In this paper we present such a practical core implementation of RL, which enables the learning process for multiple robotic tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods, we introduce a novel approach for action selection, called Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), that takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, robot pose, etc.), thus experienced sets of states accelerate the decision-making process of unexplored or rarely-explored states. Intensive experiments with both real and simulated robots, carried out with the software framework also introduced here, show that our implementation is able to learn different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. They also suggest that the combination of true online SARSA(λ) (TOSL) with QBIASSR can outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks.

                  The utility of a robotically controlled laser for use in a predator–prey-like (PPL) paradigm was explored for use in rats. This involved the construction of a robotic two-dimensional gimbal to dynamically position a laser beam in a behavioral test chamber. Custom software was used to control the trajectory and final laser position in response to user input on a console. The software also detected the location of the laser beam and the rodent continuously so that the dynamics of the distance between them could be analyzed. When the animal or laser beam came within a fixed distance the animal would either be rewarded with electrical brain stimulation or shocked subcutaneously.
               
                  Results
                  Animals that received rewarding electrical brain stimulation could learn to chase the laser beam, while animals that received aversive subcutaneous shock learned to actively avoid the laser beam in the PPL paradigm.

Specifically, for miniature mobile robots with serious computational limitations, that are typical of embedded systems, one of the main challenges is the adaptation of efficient computational methods in order to find solutions of complex optimization problems, which demand large execution times. This drawback compels the design of high-performance parallel optimization algorithms which must run over embedded system platforms. This paper describes how adequate hardware implementations of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm can be useful for real time adaptation of mobile robot controllers. For achieving this, a new architecture is proposed, which is based on an FPGA implementation of the opposition-based learning (OBL) approach applied to the PSO (for short HPOPSO), and which explores the intrinsic parallelism of this algorithm in order to adjust the weights of a neural robot controller in real time according to desired behaviors. The proposed HPOPSO was applied to the learning-from-demonstration problem in which a teacher performs executions of the desired behavior. Effectiveness of the proposed architecture was demonstrated by numerical simulations and the feasibility of the adaptive behavior of the neural robot controller was confirmed for two obstacle avoidance case studies that were preserved when one or more failures on the distance sensors occur.

The information processed within different neural subsystems is neurocomputed using distributed and dynamic patterns of neural activity. These emerging patterns can be hardly understood by merely taking into account individual cell activities. Studying how these patterns are elicited in the CNS under specific behavioral tasks has become a groundbreaking research topic in system neuroscience. This methodology of synthetic behavioral experimentation is also motivated by the concept of embodied neuroscience, according to which the primary goal of the CNS is to solve/facilitate the body–environment interaction.
                  With the aim to bridge the gap between system neuroscience and biological control, this paper presents how the CNS neural structures can be connected/integrated within a body agent; in particular, an efficient neural simulator based on EDLUT (Ros et al., 2006) has been integrated within a simulated robotic environment to facilitate the implementation of object manipulating closed loop experiments (action–perception loop). This kind of experiment allows the study of the neural abstraction process of dynamic models that occurs within our neural structures when manipulating objects.

Once we are able to build a cerebellar model that runs in realtime, which means that a computer simulation of 1 s in the simulated world completes within 1 s in the real world, the cerebellar model could be used as a realtime adaptive neural controller for physical hardware such as humanoid robots. In this paper, we introduce “Realtime Cerebellum (RC)”, a new implementation of our large-scale spiking network model of the cerebellum, which was originally built to study cerebellar mechanisms for simultaneous gain and timing control and acted as a general-purpose supervised learning machine of spatiotemporal information known as reservoir computing, on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Owing to the massive parallel computing capability of a GPU, RC runs in realtime, while reproducing qualitatively the same simulation results of the Pavlovian delay eyeblink conditioning with the previous version. RC is adopted as a realtime adaptive controller of a humanoid robot, which is instructed to learn a proper timing to swing a bat to hit a flying ball online.

However, these algorithms tend to require large amounts of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain on robots in the real world. We present an approach for efficiently learning goal-directed navigation policies on a mobile robot, from only a single coverage traversal of recorded data. The navigation agent learns an effective policy over a diverse action space in a large heterogeneous environment consisting of more than 2km of travel, through buildings and outdoor regions that collectively exhibit large variations in visual appearance, self-similarity, and connectivity. We compare pretrained visual encoders that enable precomputation of visual embeddings to achieve a throughput of tens of thousands of transitions per second at training time on a commodity desktop computer, allowing agents to learn from millions of trajectories of experience in a matter of hours. We propose multi- ple forms of computationally efficient stochastic augmentation to enable the learned policy to generalise beyond these precomputed embeddings, and demonstrate successful deployment of the learned policy on the real robot without fine tuning, despite environmental appearance differences at test time.

While the demand for these apaplications is growing, the performance benefits from general-purpose platforms is diminishing. This challenge has coincided with the explosion of data where the rate of data generation has reached an overwhelming level that is beyond the capabilities of current computing systems. Therefore, applications such as machine learning and robotics can benefit from hardware acceleration. Traditionally, to accelerate a set of workloads, we pro- file the code optimized for CPUs and offload the hot functions on hardware compute units designed specially for that particular function, hence providing higher performance and energy efficiency. Instead in this work, we take a revolutionary approach where we delve into the algorithmic properties of applications to define domain-generic hardware acceleration solutions. We leverage the property that a wide range of machine learning algorithms can be modeled as stochastic optimization problems. Using this insight we devise compute stacks for hardware acceleration that are built independent of the CPU. These stacks expose a high-level mathematical programming interface and automatically generate accelerators for users who have limited knowledge about hardware design, but can benefit from large performance and efficiency gains for their programs. 
Keeping these ambitious goals in mind, our work (1) strikes a balance between generality and specialization by breaking the long-held traditional abstraction of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) in favor of a more algorithm-centric approach; (2) develops hard- ware acceleration frameworks by co-designing a language, compiler, runtime system, and hardware to provide high performance and efficiency, in addition to flexibility and programmability; (3) segregates algorithmic specification from implementation to shield the programmer from continual hardware/software modifications while allowing them to benefit from the emerging heterogeneity of modern compute platforms; and (4) develops real cross-stack prototypes to evaluate these innovative solutions in a real-world setting and make them open-source to maximize community engagement and industry impact.

Among the various pre-processing steps of ML, Automatic Image Annotation (also known as automatic image tagging or linguistic indexing) is the process in which a computer system automatically assigns metadata in the form of captioning or keywords to a digital image. Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) methods (which have appeared during the last several years) make a large use of many ML approaches. Clustering and classification methods are most frequently applied to annotate images. In addition, these proposed solutions require a high computational infrastructure. However, certain real-time applications (small and ad-hoc intelligent applications) for example, autonomous small robots, gadgets, drone etc. have limited computational processing capacity. These small and ad-hoc applications demand a more dynamic and portable way to automatically annotate data and then perform ML tasks (Classification, clustering etc.) in real time using limited computational power and hardware resources. Through a comprehensive literature study we found that most image pre-processing algorithms and ML tasks are computationally intensive, and it can be challenging to run them on an embedded platform with acceptable frame rates. However, Raspberry Pi is sufficient for AIA and ML tasks that are relevant to small and ad-hoc intelligent applications. In addition, few critical intelligent applications (which require high computational resources, for example, Deep Learning using huge dataset) are only feasible to run on more powerful hardware resources. In this study, we present the framework of “Automatic Image Annotation for Small and Ad-hoc Intelligent Application using Raspberry Pi” and propose the low-cost infrastructures (single node and multi node using Raspberry Pi) and software module (for Raspberry Pi) to perform AIA and ML tasks in real time for small and ad-hoc intelligent applications.

systems is the tuning of the controller parameters. Typically, a model of the
system is used to obtain an initial controller, but ultimately the controller
parameters must be tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best
performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, methods from machine learning,
such as Bayesian optimization, have been used. However, as these methods
evaluate different controller parameters on the real system, safety-critical
system failures may happen. In this paper, we overcome this problem by
applying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm,
SafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an
initial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the
parameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying
performance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller
parameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high
probability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the
proposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller
parameters without human intervention.Comment: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2016. 6

Moreover,in modern human societies it is of great importance to build up machines thatcan be operated by non specialists or even by technologically illiterate people,such as youngsters or elderly. Therefore, the mobile robots to be released intothe market in the near future should possess, among others, the potential ofproducing meaningful internal perceptual representations of their own environment,capacitating them to cope a range of real-life situations and tasks. Tomake matters even more challenging, when it comes for mapping and navigation,robots should comprehend human concepts about places and objects,to skillfully deploy in human frequented environments. In response to thischallenge, intense research efforts, to build cognitive robots apt to competentlyperceive and understand their surroundings and to cooperate with humans,take place. With this goal in view, semantic mapping with mobile robots can constituteto a holistic solution in response to the aforementioned challenges. Thesemantic mapping is an augmented representation of the robot’s environmentthat -supplementary to the geometrical knowledge- encapsulates characteristicscompatible with human understanding. It provides several algorithmic opportunitiesfor innovative development of applications that will eventually lead tothe human robot interaction. The main objective of the PhD dissertation in handis the construction of accurate and consistent semantic maps facilitating amplerobot deployment in domestic environments.The motivation behind this PhD dissertation has been the observation thatthe plethora of the existing mapping and navigation algorithms are not ableto provide a sufficient representation of the environment in terms of humans’concepts. This is due to the fact that the mapping methods developed sofar focus on the construction of geometrical maps. Although some of thesesolutions proved to be capable of driving robots into specific target positions,they lack of high level cognition attributes, which would allow them to bring the human-robot interaction one step beyond. Aiming to remove this barrier, thisdissertation is oriented towards the direction of developing semantic mappingalgorithms for high level robot navigation. Therefore, this doctoral researchidentified the basic components of the semantic mapping and developed aninnovative solution for each one of them. Due to the fact that the semanticmapping requires an integrated system that comprises several subordinatemodules, a wide range of a algorithms that serve different tasks had to bedesigned and implemented. Within the context of this thesis several algorithmicmodules have been developed including a competent localization algorithm,novel simultaneously localization and mapping strategies, breakthrough place andobject recognition tactics, as well as the integration of all these methods undera time supervised framework able to produce consistent semantic maps. Dueto the fact that each subordinate module comprises an innovative solutionto the respective field, the resulting semantic mapping system constitutesa state of the art solution in the area of conceptual mapping with mobilerobots. The introduced algorithms exploit solely visual and depth sensors,while by combining basic tools from three different scientific areas such asrobotics, computer vision and machine learning the final objective is accomplished.Overall, the main contribution of this thesis to the advancement the stateof the art is the introduction of a stacked map hierarchy of four differenttype of maps, namely a metric, a topological, a labeled sparse topological andan augmented navigation one. Each of these representations accomplishes aunique purpose: (i) the metric is the physical (lower) layer; (ii) the topologicalone contains abstract geometrical information of the environment, i.e. pointclouds registered in a graph of nodes; (iii) the labeled sparse topological oneestablishes the spatiotemporal coherence by associating the respective nodes inthe topometric maps via place labels and geometrical transformations, enablingbidirectional exchange of information among the conceptual and metric mapsand, last, (iv) the augmented navigation map inheres the significance of thedetected places as well as their connectivity relationships, expressed in termsof their transition probability.The thesis in hand has been developed in a hierarchical fashion and can bedivided into four main chapters. The first one comprises a literature survey ofthe existing semantic mapping methods in which an explicit analysis of the sofar developed methods is sought. The insights of the semantic mapping arereviewed, the distinct components encompassing, to give a categorization of therelated literature, are studied the possible applications in mobile robotics areexamined and, lastly, the methods and databases available for benchmarkingare referred. Furthermore, a quality-based taxonomy of the existing semanticmapping methods highlights the dominant attributes such methods retain.More precisely, according to the scale, to which each method is expanded, the metric map could be either a single scene or a progressively created map.Another important attribute a typical semantic mapping method possessesis the existence of the respective topological map, that is an abstraction ofthe explored environment in terms of a graph. The nodes of such a graph areorganized in a geometrical manner, so as to simultaneously preserve conceptualknowledge about the explored places. Moreover, the modalities (single ormultiple visual cues) utilized to reason about the observed scene constitute anelement apt to distinguish the abundance of different methods. An additionalfeature in many recent semantic mapping techniques is the temporal coherencesuch a map reveals, which renders it useful for high-level activities, viz. taskplanning or human robot interaction.The second chapter refers to the description of the developed technologicalbackground required to build a consistent semantic map. Therefore, a majorcontribution of the first part is the development of an innovative visual odometryalgorithm able to operate in real time. This algorithm receives as input successivestereo pair of images from a stereoscopic camera mounted on a mobilerobot. It involves the detection of the salient landmarks between successiveimages. A depth estimation of these features is then obtained and a novelnon-iterative outlier detection and discarding methodology able to remove boththe mismatches between the features and the inserted errors due to the 3Dreconstruction procedure. A hierarchical motion estimation technique, whichproduces robust estimations for the movement of the robot is then adopted,thus providing refinements to the robot’s global position and orientation. Anadditional 3D reconstruction algorithm that operates on stereo images hasbeen developed providing accurate reconstruction of the area observed bythe robot. Moreover, the localization algorithm comprises the cornerstone forthe development of a simultaneously localization and mapping system suitablefor the 3D geometrical mapping of the explored environment. This 3D metricmapping system is based solely on an RGB-D sensor, where in course of robot’slocomotion 3D point clouds are merged with respect to the visual odometry.The resulted 3D map is refined by exploiting a random sample consensus planedetection algorithm accompanied by an iterative closest point registration step,among the dominant planes of the consecutive time instances, resulting thusin a very consistent geometrical 3D map. All the aforementioned developedalgorithms have been evaluated on a custom made robot platform bearing twostereoscopic cameras with different baselines and a RGB-D sensor.The third chapter encloses all the semantic mapping methods based onvisual cues that have been developed within this PhD dissertation. The firstone examines the overall traversability of the observed scene taking into considerationthe robot’s embodiment. This knowledge constitutes a cornerstone forthe autonomous robot navigation. The developed system utilizes an algorithm to retrieve specific characteristics of the environment using a stereo cameraand to produce a disparity map of the scene. Then, the v-disparity image iscalculated based on the disparity map. The v-disparity is then exploited by afeature extraction procedure to provide the system with respective conceptualvectors, which are used to train support vector machines in order to assess theoverall traversability of the scene. The traversable classified scenes are furtherprocessed and the likelihood distribution of the collision risk assessment, whenthe robot moves towards any direction, is calculated. The second part involvesthe description of a novel object recognition algorithm based on hierarchical temporalmemory networks. This constitutes a supervised learning method usedto recognize objects in different orientations. It introduces specific alternativerules for the design of each building block of a hierarchical temporal memorynetwork. These rules expand both the spatial and the temporal module ofthe network. Various type of input layers have been tested such as logppolarand saliency detection ones in order to find the solution that fits better in applicationsthat concern cluttered environments. The third part of this chaptercomprises the description of an innovative place classification algorithm. Withinthis work, in course of robot’s locomotion, salient visual features are detectedand they shape a bag-of-features problem, quantized by a neural gas to codethe spatial information for each scene. Each input image is transformed intoan appearance based histogram representation that abstracts the place in avery compatible and consistent manner. The learning procedure is performedby support vector machines able to accurately recognize multiple dissimilarplaces. The innovative appearance based algorithm produces semantic inferencessuitable for labeling unexplored environments. In the rest of this chaptera long range semantic mapping framework is described, where geometricalmapping, with place and object recognition is combined in order to construct ahuman oriented semasiological map. This framework features geometrical andsemasiological attributes capable to reveal relationships between objects andplaces in a real-life environment. The geometrical component consists of a 3Dmap, onto which a topological map is deployed, representing the explored areaas a graph of nodes. The semasiological part is realized by putting together aplace recognition algorithm and an object recognition one. The categorizationof the different places relies on the resolution of appearance-based consistencyhistograms, while for the recognition of objects in the scene we make use of thehierarchical temporal memory network boosted by a saliency attentional model.These semantical attributes are then deposited on each node of the topologicalmap, in order to augment it with the belief distributions regarding the visitedplaces, thus resulting in a 3D object map embodying geometrical and semanticalproperties.Finally, in the fourth chapter of this thesis a novel semantic mapping method suitable for robot navigation in a human compatible manner is illustrated. Themain objective of this chapter is to take into account the time proximity of therobot acquired frames within the semantic map. The goal of this method is; (i)to introduce a semasiological mapping method for robot exploration and (ii) tomake use of the constructed semantic map as a means to provide a hierarchicalnavigation solution. The semantic map is formed during the robot’s course,relying on the memorization of abstract place representations. It integrates thespace quantization, the time proximity of the acquired frames and the spatialcoherence in terms of a novel labeled sparse topological map. A time evolvingaugmented navigation graph is shaped determining the semantic topology ofthe explored environment and the physical connectivity among the recognizedplaces expressed by the inter-place transition probability. Concerning therobot navigation part, a human-robot interaction methodology is illustratedcapable of competently addressing go-to commands. As a product of thismodule, an augmented navigation graph is formed, which handles the high levelrobot navigation, forwarding the presumable sequence of places the robotshould traverse to reach its target location. Accordingly, for the low levellocal navigation the topometric data of the semantic map are made use of.Additionally, to assist the human robot interaction a graphical user interfacehas been developed providing an overall supervision of the mapping andnavigation procedure.The last chapter of this dissertation concludes the doctoral research conductedhereby. It discusses the achievements of this work, while it also highlightsthe open issues and the questions revealed during the developmentof the several algorithmic solutions.

Robotics-assisted tilt table technology was introduced for early rehabilitation of neurological patients. It provides cyclical stepping movement and physiological loading of the legs. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility of this type of device for peak cardiopulmonary performance testing using able-bodied subjects.

METHODS:

A robotics-assisted tilt table was augmented with force sensors in the thigh cuffs and a work rate estimation algorithm. A custom visual feedback system was employed to guide the subjects' work rate and to provide real time feedback of actual work rate. Feasibility assessment focused on: (i) implementation (technical feasibility), and (ii) responsiveness (was there a measurable, high-level cardiopulmonary reaction?). For responsiveness testing, each subject carried out an incremental exercise test to the limit of functional capacity with a work rate increment of 5 W/min in female subjects and 8 W/min in males.

RESULTS:

11 able-bodied subjects were included (9 male, 2 female; age 29.6 ± 7.1 years: mean ± SD). Resting oxygen uptake (O_{2}) was 4.6 ± 0.7 mL/min/kg and O_{2}peak was 32.4 ± 5.1 mL/min/kg; this mean O_{2}peak was 81.1% of the predicted peak value for cycle ergometry. Peak heart rate (HRpeak) was 177.5 ± 9.7 beats/min; all subjects reached at least 85% of their predicted HRpeak value. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at O_{2}peak was 1.02 ± 0.07. Peak work rate) was 61.3 ± 15.1 W. All subjects reported a Borg CR10 value for exertion and leg fatigue of 7 or more.

CONCLUSIONS:

The robotics-assisted tilt table is deemed feasible for peak cardiopulmonary performance testing: the approach was found to be technically implementable and substantial cardiopulmonary responses were observed. Further testing in neurologically-impaired subjects is warranted",robotics,807,included

Robots have the potential to solve many problems in society, because of their ability to work in dangerous places doing necessary jobs that no one wants or is able to do. One barrier to their widespread deployment is that they are mainly limited to tasks where it is possible to hand-program behaviors for every situation that may be encountered. For robots to meet their potential, they need methods that enable them to learn and adapt to novel situations that they were not programmed for. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making processes and could solve the problems of learning and adaptation on robots. This book identifies four key challenges that must be addressed for an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks. These RL for Robotics Challenges are: 1) it must learn in very few samples; 2) it must learn in domains with continuous state features; 3) it must handle sensor and/or actuator delays; and 4) it should continually select actions in real time. This book focuses on addressing all four of these challenges. In particular, this book is focused on time-constrained domains where the first challenge is critically important. In these domains, the agent’s lifetime is not long enough for it to explore the domains thoroughly, and it must learn in very few samples",robotics,808,not included

Though developments in sensor technology have resulted in the deployment of robots in specific applications the ability to accurately sense and interact with the environment is still missing. Key challenges to the widespread deployment of robots include the ability to learn models of environmental features based on sensory inputs, bootstrap off of the learned models to detect and adapt to environmental changes, and autonomously tailor the sensory processing to the task at hand. This paper summarizes a comprehensive effort towards such bootstrap learning, adaptation, and processing management using visual input. We describe probabilistic algorithms that enable a mobile robot to autonomously plan its actions to learn models of color distributions and illuminations.

Most existing multi-robot collision avoidance systems either require communication between robots or require expensive movement data of other robots, like velocities, accelerations and paths. In this paper, we propose a map-based deep reinforcement learning approach for multi-robot collision avoidance in a distributed and communication-free environment. We use the egocentric local grid map of a robot to represent the environmental information around it including its shape and observable appearances of other robots and obstacles, which can be easily generated by using multiple sensors or sensor fusion. Then we apply the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm to train a convolutional neural network that directly maps three frames of egocentric local grid maps and the robot’s relative local goal positions into low-level robot control commands. Compared to other methods, the map-based approach is more robust to noisy sensor data, does not require robots’ movement data and considers sizes and shapes of related robots, which make it to be more efficient and easier to be deployed to real robots. We first train the neural network in a specified simulator of multiple mobile robots using DPPO, where a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy for multiple scenarios is used to improve the performance. Then we deploy the trained model to real robots to perform collision avoidance in their navigation without tedious parameter tuning. We evaluate the approach with multiple scenarios both in the simulator and on four differential-drive mobile robots in the real world. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our approach is efficient and outperforms existing DRL-based approaches in many indicators. We also conduct ablation studies showing the positive effects of using egocentric grid maps and multi-stage curriculum learning.",robotics,814,included

The competitive accuracy and robustness of these algorithms compared to state-of-the-art feature-based methods, as well as their natural ability to yield dense maps, makes them an appealing choice for a variety of mobile robotics applications. However, direct methods remain brittle in the face of appearance change due to their underlying assumption of photometric consistency, which is commonly violated in practice. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this problem by training deep convolutional encoder-decoder models to transform images of a scene such that they correspond to a previously-seen canonical appearance. We validate our method in multiple environments and illumination conditions using high-fidelity synthetic RGB-D datasets, and integrate the trained models into a direct visual localization pipeline, yielding improvements in visual odometry (VO) accuracy through time-varying illumination conditions, as well as improved metric relocalization performance under illumination change, where conventional methods normally fail.

However, technical restrictions of traditional brain imaging approaches including functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) severely limit participants' movements during experiments (Makeig et al., 2009). As a consequence, our knowledge of the neural basis of human cognition is rooted in a dissociation of human cognition from what is arguably its foremost, and certainly its most evolutionarily determinant function—organizing our behavior so as to optimize its consequences in our complex, multi-scale, and ever-changing environment. The concept of natural cognition, therefore, should not be separated from our fundamental experience and role as an embodied agent acting in a complex, partly unpredictable world.

To gain new insights into the brain dynamics supporting natural cognition requires overcoming restrictions of traditional brain imaging technologies (Gramann et al., 2011). First, the sensors must be lightweight and untethered to allow monitoring of brain activity during free movements. Fortunately, new electroencephalography (EEG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors and sensing devices allow recording both electrical and hemodynamic brain and body activity while participants are freely moving (Lin et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2012; Ayaz et al., 2013). New data-driven analysis approaches must allow separation of signals arriving at the sensors from the brain as well as non-brain sources like neck muscles, eyes, heart, and the electrical environment (Makeig et al., 2004). Independent component analysis (ICA) and related blind source separation methods have proven effective for separating brain from non-brain activities from electrophysiological data recorded during experimental paradigms that stimulate natural cognition (Gramann et al., 2014). ICA has also proven valuable for separating other multi-channel signals including electromyographic (EMG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) activities (Gramann et al., 2010; Gwin et al., 2010; Kline et al., 2014).

Adequate study of natural cognition also requires synchronous recording of participants' motor actions as well as the physical environment and external events influencing cognition. Recording what the brain does (via EEG and fNIRS brain imaging), what it senses (via scene and event recording), and what it organizes (via motor, ocular, and autonomic activity recording) may be termed mobile brain/body imaging (“MoBI”). Technically, recording MoBI data is now possible at reasonable cost and convenience. However, joint multi-stream analysis of the data recorded in MoBI paradigms presents major conceptual, mathematical, and data processing challenges (Ojeda et al., 2014).

To overcome restrictions of established brain imaging methods and to facilitate further development of mobile brain/body imaging, a group of researchers from all over the world gathered in the beautiful scientific retreat of the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg in Delmenhorst, Germany in September 2013 for the first international meeting on Mobile Brain/Body Imaging. During a stimulating and intense workshop, attendees presented and discussed newest developments in mobile brain imaging technologies, novel software architectures for recording and analyzing multidimensional data streams, and other topics relevant to MoBI. Most attendees at the Delmenhorst meeting contributed to this Research Topic; other research groups have added contributions sharing related ideas. The present Research Topic thus provides an excellent overview of the current state of the art in mobile brain/body imaging. The topics cover the three main pillars of MoBI research, i.e., hardware for imaging mobile brain and body dynamics, software to record and analyze complex multi-dimensional data streams, and applications of MoBI to such diverse fields as neuroergonomics, gait rehabilitation, spatial cognition, and dance.

Starting with the technical aspects of MoBI, Reis et al. (2014), provide an overview on existing hardware and software solutions for MoBI recordings. Focusing on new sensor technology and analysis approaches, Lin et al. report a test of a new mobile EEG headgear using steady-state visual-evoked potentials in participants during treadmill walking (Lin et al., 2014). With the aim to include gaze tracking as an important information channel for investigations of natural cognition and associated brain dynamics Browatzki and colleagues describe and compare two different approaches to measuring eye movements in mobile participants (Browatzki et al., 2014).

The second pillar of MoBI, software frameworks for recording and analyses of multi-modal imaging data is addressed by Ojeda and colleagues providing a description of a new open source toolbox (Ojeda et al., 2014). MoBILAB interoperates with EEGLAB (Delorme and Makeig, 2004) and allows for analysis and visualization of multidimensional mobile brain/body imaging data. Zao et al. (2014) introduce an exciting new perspective on distributed computing describing a novel network system approach to remote monitoring of brain/body activity of one or many mobile participants.

The majority of contributions to this Research Topic can be summarized under the pillar of MoBI applications. The review by Mehta and Parasuraman (2013) provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of existing imaging modalities in the area of neuroergonomics, describing differing temporal and spatial resolutions and the degree of immobility that brain imaging method imposes on participants. Ayaz et al. (2013) describe the development and application of a mobile fNIRS device for investigating changes in workload in real operating environments providing an example of mobile recordings of hemodynamics. The first investigation of kinesthetic and vestibular information processing in actively navigating participants is given by Ehinger et al. (2014). The authors dissociate the brain dynamics underlying different proprioceptive senses during movements. Wagner et al. (2014) use MoBI to describe the cortical networks activated during robot-assisted walking and investigate the potential impact of movement-related feedback for gait rehabilitation. Cruz-Garza and colleagues investigate professional dancers during different whole body movements and derive distinct expressive qualities of movement from surface EEG (Cruz-Garza et al., 2014). While the previous studies used whole body movement, Amengual and colleagues describe the brain dynamics associated with the preparation and execution of multi-joint self-paced arm movements (Amengual et al., 2014). Finally, in their paper Derix et al. elucidate the neuronal basis of mental processes during natural communication based on electrocorticography in pre-neurosurgical patients (Derix et al., 2014).

All contributions in this Research Topic go beyond the state of the art in brain imaging and provide new approaches to recording and analyzing multi-modal data. The authors describe new insights into the neural basis of cognitive processes beyond traditional laboratory research. We hope this Research Topic may inspire new research that uses the MoBI paradigm to investigate natural cognition by recording and analyzing brain dynamics and behavior of participants performing a wide range of naturally motivated actions and interactions.",robotics,817,not included

Deep Neural Networks (DNN's) have come up as state of art for various machine intelligence applications such as object detection, image classification, face recognition and performs myriad of activities with exceptional prediction accuracy. AI in this contemporary world is moving towards embedded platforms for inference on the edge. This is essential to avoid latency, enhance data security and realize real-time performance. However, these DNN algorithms are computational and memory intensive. Consequently, exploiting immense energy, compute resources and memory-bandwidth making it difficult to be deployed in embedded devices. To solve this problem and realize an on-device AI acceleration, dedicated energy-efficient hardware accelerators are paramount. This thesis involves the implementation of such a dedicated deep learning accelerator on the FPGA. The NVIDIA's Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA), is encompassed in this research to explore SoC designs for integrated inference acceleration. NVDLA, an open-source architecture, standardizes deep learning inference acceleration on hardware. It optimizes inference acceleration all across the full stack from application through hardware to achieve energy efficiency synergy with the demanding throughput requirements. Therefore, the following thesis probes into the NVDLA framework to perceive the consistent workflow across the whole hardware-software programming hierarchies. Besides, the hardware design parameters, optimization features and system configurations of the NVDLA systems are analyzed for efficient implementations. Also, a comparative study of the diverse NVDLA SoC implementations (nv\_small and nv\_medium) with respect to performance metrics such as power, area, and throughput are discussed.

Besides these NVDLA hardware design also runs pre-compiled AlexNet as a benchmark for performance evaluation and comparisonToday, Artificial Intelligence is at the edge. This edge or endpoint device is becoming more sophisticated with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. For instance, these devices are employed in different applications such as autonomous cars, drones, and other IoT gadgets. At present, a self-driving car is a data center on wheels, a drone is a data center on wings as well as robots are data centers with arms and legs. All these mechanisms collect vast real-world information that demands to be processed in real-time. Here in these applications, there is no time to send data to the cloud for processing and wait for action. As the decision making needs to be instantaneous. There is a shift in transforming the processing to the edge devices. The edge acceleration brings computation and data storage closer to the device. With the evolution of specialized hardware’s providing increased computational capabilities, the AI models are processed on the edge. As a result, the overall system latency gets reduced, the bandwidth costs for data transfers are lowered and the data processing is done locally enhances privacy concerns. For example, autonomous cars require a spontaneous reaction (in seconds) to avoid potential hazards on the road. Consider the situation where a self-driving car is collecting real word information like images, videos, in this case, assume it’s sensing for a stop sign. If the system sends the specific image information to the cloud for processing and waits for a decision to stop. By that response time, the autonomous vehicle could have already blown through the stop sign running over several people. Therefore, it is paramount to process the data in real-time which could be accomplished using dedicated hardware for processing locally. This thesis primarily explores those hardware architectures for efficient processing of AI algorithms and their corresponding software execution environment setup. The particular thesis was carried out as a joint collaboration between Ericsson and Lund University. Here Nvidia’s Deep Learning Accelerator architecture is engaged as a target to comprehend the complete system incorporating a hardware-software co-design.

,to_check,project-academic,,28/12/2007 00:00,project-academic,toward domain neutral human level metacognition,project-academic," We have found that implementing a metacognitive loop (MCL), which gives intelligent systems the ability to selfmonitor their ongoing performance and make targeted changes to their various action-determining components, can play an important role in helping systems cope with the unexpected problems and events that are the inevitable result of real-world deployment. In this paper, we discuss our work with MCL-enhanced intelligent systems, and describe the ontologies that allow MCL to reason about, appropriately classify and respond to the perfomance anomalies it detects. Introduction: The Hardest AI Problem and the Metacognitive Loop It is widely agreed that AI has been extremely successful in the narrow sense: given any of a large variety of well-defined AI problems, there is (or, so goes the common wisdom, there could easily be) an implemented solution using reasonably well-understood techniques. Or at the very least, there are solutions to similar problems, so that there is much reason to expect solutions to the problem at hand. But in the wide sense, AI is a disappointment. Although many AI systems are at or beyond human-level competence at the individual tasks for which they were designed (from chess playing to medical diagnosis), AI systems are nowhere near human-level competence across the board. This is not simply a matter of building a system that has numerous subsystems, one for each of hundreds or thousands of individual tasks. The combined skills of a doctor, lawyer, chess-master, linguist, etc., does not a human make. For humans have, in addition to whatever number of individual skills, the ability to do reasonably well when faced with situations for which they have not been specifically trained. This general competence, the ability to muddle through when faced with the unexpected or unfamiliar, we consider to be the the core of human-level common sense. Indeed, this ability may well be the key to how we are able to train: we recognize when we lack an ability, make a decision to gain it, and recognize when it is time to stop learning—when training is complete; or complete enough for our purposes; or when it is ineffective, too slow, too expensive, or no longer important. We Copyright c © 2007, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. also (sometimes!) recognize when we are in over our heads, and then we ask for help or wisely give up. It is this general sort of ability that current AI systems lack, with the result that they tend to be brittle, easily breaking when confronted with situations beyond their set of narrow competencies. Why is this so? And why has the brittleness problem been so hard to solve? Our hypothesis is this: while there are well-established and sohpisticated AI technologies for dealing with change or novelty e.g., machine learning (ML) and commonsense reasoning (CSR), neither alone is adequate to the task in question, since each needs the other to realize its true potential. Thus ML needs reasoned guidance (a form of CSR) as to when, why, what, and how to learn; and CSR needs trainable modules (to which ML can be applied) so that the fruits of such reasoning can be applied to bring about better future performance. Proper melding of ML and CSR should, in our view, go a long way toward solving the brittleness problem and bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of AI. What will it take to meld ML and CSR in such a way as to solve the brittleness problem, i.e., to build a system that (under a wide range of unforeseen circumstances) adjusts itself instead of breaking? We have isolated four capacities. First of all, a system will need to know enough about what it is doing (its goals, its actions, and their results), so that it can detect—and then assess—when those goals are not being achieved (Brachman 2002). This is a key place where CSR comes into play, in reasoning after the fact about such goal failures. Other relevant approaches include case-based reasoning and meta-level planning (Cox 2005; Anderson & Oates 2007). Second, it will need to be able to make targeted changes to itself when there are indications of current inadequacies in what it is doing. This is where ML can come into play: if the desired changes involve any sort of training or adapting, the relevant trainable modules and their associated training processes must be invoked. Third, it will need to be able to apply the same first two capacities to monitor how a given self-change is working out (thus there is a form of recursion involved). This again involves CSR in order to assess whether the targeted change is occurring properly. And fourth, it will need to do this in real time. This is a tall order, but the elements are clear enough to allow progress. This paper reports on our work to date and where we see it headed. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We outline our specific approach to these four capacities (which we call MCL: the metacognitive loop); we discuss some early pilot studies; we present three ontologies that allow MCL to reason about, and appropriately classify and respond to the perfomance anomolies it detects; we show how these ontologies have been applied to a simulated autonomous vehicle domain; and we conclude with some general considerations and a discussion of future work.",autonomous vehicle,820,not included

Current industry-standard solutions use rule-based systems for planning. Although they perform reasonably well in common scenarios, the engineering complexity renders this approach incompatible with human-level performance. On the other hand, the performance of machine-learned (ML) planning solutions can be improved by simply adding more exemplar data. However, ML methods cannot offer safety guarantees and sometimes behave unpredictably. To combat this, our approach uses a simple yet effective rule-based fallback layer that performs sanity checks on an ML planner's decisions (e.g. avoiding collision, assuring physical feasibility). This allows us to leverage ML to handle complex situations while still assuring the safety, reducing ML planner-only collisions by 95%. We train our ML planner on 300 hours of expert driving demonstrations using imitation learning and deploy it along with the fallback layer in downtown San Francisco, where it takes complete control of a real vehicle and navigates a wide variety of challenging urban driving scenarios.",autonomous vehicle,821,included

However, that doesn't mean they are attack-proof or unexposed to vulnerabilities. Newly deployed systems particularly on a public environment (i.e public networks) are vulnerable to attacks from various entities. Moreover, published research on deep learning systems (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have determined a significant number of attacks points and a wide array of attack surface that has evidence of exploitation from adversarial examples. Successful exploit on these systems could lead to critical real world repercussions. For instance, (1) an adversarial attack on a self-driving car running a deep reinforcement learning system yields a direct misclassification on humans causing untoward accidents.(2) a self-driving vehicle misreading a red light signal may cause the car to crash to another car (3) misclassification of a pedestrian lane as an intersection lane that could lead to car crashes. This is just the tip of the iceberg, computer vision deployment are not entirely focused on self-driving cars but on many other areas as well - that would have definitive impact on the real-world.

In this paper, we use Reinforcement Learning and in particular value learning to approximate the value function given only high level objectives, which can be sparse and binary. Building upon previous works, we present improvements that allowed us to successfully deploy the method on a real world unmanned ground vehicle.

Estos C-ITS estan englobados en el plan 2020 de la Union Europea sobre las Smart Cities. Un paso previo a conseguir las aplicaciones cooperativas es la puesta en servicio de VANETs (Vehicular Area NETworks) y para ello son necesarias las comunicaciones intervehiculares (V2V) y con la infraestructura (V2I), denominadas genericamente como V2X. Sin embargo, en la actualidad no existe disponible comercialmente ningun tipo de tecnologia ni hardware ni software para dar soporte a estas comunicaciones en el entorno vehicular, quedando los equipos disponibles al uso restringido de los fabricantes de automoviles o empresas de electronica, por lo que la implantacion de esta tecnologia queda muy lejos de un usomasivo orientandose sobre todo hacia el ambito de la investigacion, en proyectos de desarrollo de sistemas cooperativos e, incluso, de vehiculos autonomos. Por tanto, en esta tesis doctoral se ha planteado el desarrollo de un hardware de comunicaciones y su software de control. Este debe ser capaz de dar servicios a comunicaciones V2X, siguiendo los estandares Europeos e internacionales en el ambito y todos los elementos que caracterizan esta tecnologia. Asimismo, el correcto funcionamiento de esta tecnologia de comunicaciones ha sido validado mediante la implementacion y puesta en servicio de cuatro sistemas cooperativos que involucran a los tres elementos fundamentales de la carretera: el vehiculo, la via y los usuarios. Para ello se ha colaborado con el grupo de investigacion Sistemas Inteligentes para la Movilidad y Comunicacion Accesible (SIMCA) perteneciente al Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial de la Escuela Tecnica Superior de Ingenieros Informaticos y con el Instituto Universitario de investigacion del Automovil (INSIA) ambos de la Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. Durante el desarrollo de esta tesis se ha utilizado la tecnologia disponible mas puntera en ese momento. En concreto se han utilizado dos tecnologias totalmente diferentes de comunicacion, WSAN (Redes inalambricas de sensores y actuadores) y DSRC (Comunicaciones dedicadas de corto alcance), las cuales tienen diferentes estandares de comunicacion. Inicialmente y gracias a la tecnologia WSAN se desarrollo un novedoso algoritmo de enrutamiento basado en geoposicionamiento creando una VANET de recoleccion de datos. Una vez demostrada la capacidad de crear una VANET lo suficientemente robusta y fiable se desarrollo un sistema cooperativo para prevenir accidentes con peatones. Posteriormente con la liberacion de la normativa europea de comunicaciones intervehiculares, a traves del Instituto Europeo de Estandarizacion de las Telecomunicaciones (ETSI), se pudo avanzar hacia la tecnologia DSRC. Para ello se ha desarrollado un modulo de comunicaciones ITS de diseno propio, denominado ITS DSRC-UPM-INSIA. Los estandares de comunicacion intervehicular han sido analizados y se ha desarrollado un software que cumple las especificaciones para poder realizar una geocomunicacion. Durante la implementacion de estas se han detectado diferentes problemas y errores los cuales se han ido solucionando. Finalmente gracias a los modulos DSRC-UPM-INSIA se han desarrollado aplicaciones cooperativas de asistencia al conductor ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) para demostrar las funcionalidades y capacidades de los modulos. En esta tesis se muestran tres sistemas cooperativos que se han desarrollado con la tecnologia DSRC que abordan diferentes problematicas: Un sistema de aviso a peatones en entornos urbanos e interurbanos, usando comunicaciones V2V y V2P. Sistema de aviso de la presencia de ciclistas en las inmediaciones del vehiculo, usando comunicaciones V2V y V2P. Aviso de motocicletas en carreteras con baja visibilidad incluyendo avisos de angulo muerto, usando comunicaciones V2V.

None ABSTRACT In the socioeconomic development of the European Union, the cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) are targeted towards reducing accidents, improving environmental quality (energy conservation and pollution reduction), increasing efficiency of transportation, increasing the capacity of the current infrastructure and business productivity. These C-ITS are part of the 2020 plan of the European Union for Smart Cities. A previous step to getting the cooperative applications is to create VANETs (Vehicular Area Networks) and for that the inter-vehicle communications (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) are necessary, generically known as V2X. However, there is currently no commercially available technology or any hardware or software to support these communications in the vehicular environment, leaving the equipment available to the restricted use of automakers and electronics companies, exclusively. Therefore, the implementation of this technology is far from widespread use, especially oriented towards the field of research, in development projects of cooperative systems and even autonomous vehicles. Consequently, this thesis proposes the development of hardware and control software, that is capable of providing services to communications V2X, following European and international standards in the field. Once implemented the core system, the proper functioning of this communications technology has been validated through implementation and commissioning of four cooperative systems involving the three fundamental elements of the road: the vehicle, route and users. This thesis has been developed in collaboration with the research group Intelligent Systems for Mobility and Communication Accessible (SIMCA) belonging to Department of Artificial Intelligence of the School of Computer Engineers and the University Automobile Research Institute (INSIA) both belonging to Technical University ofMadrid. In order to achieve this, the most advanced technology available at that time has been used: Two completely different communication technologies have been applied, WSAN (Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network) and DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication), which follow different communication standards. At first a novel routing algorithm was developed with the WSAN technology, based on geolocation and creating a VANET type collection data tree. Once demonstrated the ability to create a sufficiently robust and reliable VANET a cooperative system has been developed for the avoidance of collisions with pedestrians. Later, with the release of the European standards for inter-vehicle communications, through the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the European DSRC technology (ITS-G5) has undergoes an important step forward to create a VANET with this technology, the DSRC module UPM-INSIA has been designed as part of this thesis, with the ability of perform V2X communications following European Standards to guarantee the interoperability. In order to do so, intervehicular communication standards have been analyzed and developed a software that meets the specifications to provide geocommunication. During the implementation of the standards different lacks and errors of the current delivered version have been detected which have been solved. Together with the DSRC-UPM-INSIA modules, a set of cooperative ADAS applications have also been developed to demonstrate their functionalities and capacities. In this thesis three cooperative systems have been developed with the DSRC technology that tackle different problems: Pedestrian warning system for urban and interurban roads, using V2V and V2P communications. Bike rider presence warning system using V2V and V2P communications. Motorcycle warning system for road with poor visibility, including blid spot warning, using V2V communications The cooperative system based on WSAN and three cooperative systems based DSRC presented in this thesis have been tested in controlled conditions and real traffic situations.

self-balancing bike. Reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning technique is adopted for this purpose. The policy
gradient algorithm was used to make the bike learn by itself for balancing. Even though the AI algorithm worked well in
the virtual environment (balancing a cart-pole) it fails in the real environment. (i.e. it fails to balance the bike). It is
because of the noisy data from the sensor, which gives inaccurate information about the orientation of the bike. The noise

In view of scientific challenges for developing innovative solutions with a broad social impact, it investigates applications in biomedicine and computer-assisted navigation of visually impaired individuals. In this context, it focuses on machine learning, particularly the investigation of methods to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of deep artificial neural network architectures, such as the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) the input data can contain uncertainties, such as noise, color and geometric ubiquities, that is naturally propagated from the input layer to the convolution layers of the network affecting the quality of the extracted features. To cope with this problem, a novel pooling operation based on (type-1) fuzzy sets is proposed, named Fuzzy Pooling, which can be used as a drop-in replacement of the current, crisp, pooling layers of CNN architectures. Several experiments using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach can enhance the classification performance of a CNN.Aiming to improve the effectiveness of CNNs, especially in the context of medical image analysis, a novel architecture named Look Behind Fully Convolutional Neural Network (LB-FCN) is proposed. The architecture is capable of extracting multi-scale image features by using blocks of parallel convolutional layers with different filter sizes. These blocks are connected by look-behind connections, so that the features they produce are combined with features extracted from behind layers, thus preserving the respective information. Furthermore, it has a smaller number of free parameters than conventional CNN architectures, which makes it suitable for training with smaller datasets. This is particularly useful in medical image analysis, since data availability is usually limited, due to ethicolegal constraints. Experiments on publicly available gastrointestinal image datasets show higher classification performance compared to state-of-the-art machine and deep learning methodologies. The architecture is capable of generalizing well even when the training dataset is different than the one on which it is tested. To investigate that, a novel cross-dataset experimental study was performed on various publicly available gastrointestinal tract image datasets, containing images from different modalities, including Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) and flexible endoscopy. The number of training samples in CNN training is directly linked to their generalization performance. When the training samples are limited, such as in the case of medical images, the generalization performance is negatively affected. A typical approach to mediate this problem is to use data augmentation techniques, which image rotation and translation. While effective, this technique still requires a substantial amount of training samples to be available. To battle this problem, in the context of inflammatory conditions detection in WCE images, a novel approach is presented that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artificial images. More specifically the study trained two GANs, one to generate healthy small bowel images and another, images with inflammatory conditions. The images are then used to train a CNN architecture and validate its performance in real images. The results from this study show that the substitution of real with artificially generated endoscopic images for CNN training can be a viable option.While CNNs have a remarkable performance in computer vision problems, usually, they are computationally expensive. This limits their usage in high-end expensive devices with multiple graphical processing units (GPUs). To mediate the problem, a typical approach is to reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for inference, at the expense of generalization performance. In this context, a novel LB-FCN inspired CNN architecture was proposed, named LB-FCN light. The architecture features a relatively low number of free parameters and FLOPs, while managing to maintain high generalization performance. The performance of the network is validated in the problem of staircase detection in indoor and outdoor environments, with application on assisted navigation of visually impaired individuals. The results from the experimental evaluation of LB-FCN light indicate its advantageous performance over the relevant state-of-the-art architectures.The development of easy-to-use machine learning (ML) application frameworks has enabled the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications with only a few lines of self-explanatory code. However, the deployment of ML algorithms as a service for remote high throughput ML task execution, involving complex data-processing pipelines can still be challenging, especially with respect to production ML use cases. To cope with this issue, a novel system architecture is presented, which enables Algorithm-agnostic, Scalable ML (ASML) task execution for high throughput applications. It aims to provide an answer to the research question of how to design and implement an abstraction framework, suitable for the deployment of end-to-end ML pipelines in a generic and standard way. The architecture manages horizontal scaling, task scheduling, reporting, monitoring and execution of multi-client ML tasks using modular, extensible components that abstract the execution details of the underlying algorithms. Applications of ASML are investigated for the analysis of image streams in the context of medical image analysis and assisted navigation of visually impaired individuals. The results of the experiments performed demonstrate its capacity for parallel, mission critical, task execution. Assistive navigation systems require the development, assessment, and optimization of different algorithms for obstacle detection, recognition, and avoidance, as well as path planning. This is a painstaking and costly process that requires repetitive measurements under stable conditions, which is usually difficult to achieve. To this end, a novel digital twin framework for the simulation and evaluation of assistive navigation systems is presented. The framework can replicate relevant real-life situations, enabling the evaluation and optimization of algorithms through adjustable and cost-effective simulations. The utility and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated with an indicative simulation study in the context of a camera-based wearable system for the navigation of visually impaired individuals in an outdoor cultural space.The work presented in this dissertation includes methods with both theoretical and practical impact, that can be used as the basis for further research, and the applications presented can be used as paradigms for applications on different domains, such as telemedicine, robotics, and intelligent transportation systems.Η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή διερευνά πρωτότυπα έξυπνα συστήματα και υπηρεσίες ανάλυσης εικόνας και βίντεο. Λαμβάνοντας υπόψη τις επιστημονικές προκλήσεις για την ανάπτυξη καινοτόμων λύσεων με ευρύ κοινωνικό αντίκτυπο, διερευνά εφαρμογές στη βιοϊατρική και την καθοδήγηση ατόμων με προβλήματα όρασης. Σε αυτό το πλαίσιο, επικεντρώνεται στη μηχανική μάθηση, εστιάζοντας στη διερεύνηση μεθόδων για τη βελτίωση της αποδοτικότητας και αποτελεσματικότητας των αρχιτεκτονικών βαθέων τεχνητών νευρικών δικτύων, όπως τα Συνελικτικά Νευρωνικά Δίκτυα (Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN).Τα δεδομένα εισόδου των CNN μπορούν να περιέχουν αβεβαιότητες, όπως θόρυβος, χρώμα και γεωμετρική απροσδιοριστία, που μεταδίδονται από το επίπεδο εισόδου στα συνελικτικά επίπεδα του δικτύου επηρεάζοντας την ποιότητα των εξαγόμενων χαρακτηριστικών. Προκειμένου να αντιμετωπιστεί αυτό το πρόβλημα, προτείνεται μια νέα λειτουργία συγκέντρωσης (pooling) βασισμένη σε ασαφή σύνολα (τύπου-1), με όνομα Fuzzy Pooling, η οποία μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για την αντικατάσταση των υπαρχόντων επιπέδων pooling των CNN αρχιτεκτονικών. Πειράματα σε δημοσίως διαθέσιμα δεδομένα έδειξαν ότι η χρήση της  προτεινόμενη προσέγγισης μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για την βελτίωση της απόδοσης ταξινόμησης των CNN.Με στόχο τη βελτίωση της αποτελεσματικότητας των CNN, και ειδικότερα στο πλαίσιο της ανάλυσης ιατρικών εικόνων, προτάθηκε μια νέα αρχιτεκτονική CNN που ονομάζεται Look Behind Fully Convolutional Neural Network (LB-FCN). Η αρχιτεκτονική είναι ικανή να εξαγάγει χαρακτηριστικά πολλαπλών κλιμάκων χρησιμοποιώντας σύνολα (μπλοκ) παράλληλων συνελικτικών στρωμάτων με διαφορετικά μεγέθη φίλτρου. Τα σύνολα αυτά, συνδέονται με οπίσθιες συνδέσεις, με στόχο τον συνδυασμό των παραγόμενων χαρακτηριστικών με τα χαρακτηριστικά  εισόδου, διατηρώντας έτσι τις αντίστοιχες πληροφορίες. Επιπλέον, η αρχιτεκτονική έχει μικρότερο πλήθος ελεύθερων παραμέτρων σε σχέση με συμβατικές αρχιτεκτονικές CNN, γεγονός που επιτρέπει την εκπαίδευσή της με μικρό πλήθος δεδομένων εκπαίδευσης. Αυτό είναι ιδιαίτερα χρήσιμο στην ανάλυση ιατρικών εικόνας, δεδομένου ότι η διαθεσιμότητα δεδομένων εκπαίδευσης είναι συνήθως περιορισμένη, λόγω βιοηθικών και νομικών περιορισμών. Πειράματα σε δημοσίως διαθέσιμα δεδομένα εικόνων του γαστρεντερικού συστήματος, παρουσιάζουν υψηλή απόδοση ταξινόμησης σε σύγκριση με άλλες σύγχρονες προσεγγίσεις. Η αρχιτεκτονική είναι ικανή να γενικεύει καλά ακόμη και όταν το δεδομένα εκπαίδευσης προέρχονται από διαφορετικά σύνολα δεδομένων από αυτά στα οποίο δοκιμάζεται. Σε αυτό το πλαίσιο, πραγματοποιήθηκε πειραματική μελέτη σε πληθώρα δημοσίων διαθέσιμων συνόλων δεδομένων γαστρεντερικού συστήματος, απαρτιζόμενα από εικόνες που έχουν ληφθεί κάνοντας χρήση διαφορετικών ιατρικών οργάνων, όπως ενδοσκοπικής κάψουλας και εύκαμπτου ενδοσκοπίου. Η δυνατότητα γενίκευσης των CNN συνδέεται άμεσα με το διαθέσιμο πλήθος δειγμάτων εκπαίδευσης. Όταν τα δείγματα εκπαίδευσης είναι περιορισμένα, όπως στην περίπτωση ιατρικών εικόνων, η δυνατότητα γενίκευσης επηρεάζεται αρνητικά. Μια τυπική προσέγγιση για τον περιορισμό αυτού του προβλήματος είναι η χρήση τεχνικών επαύξησης δεδομένων, τροποποιώντας τα υπάρχοντα δεδομένα. Αν και η τεχνική αυτή είναι αποτελεσματική και πάλι απαιτείται σημαντικό πλήθος δεδομένων εκπαίδευσης. Για την καταπολέμηση αυτού του προβλήματος, στο πλαίσιο της ανίχνευσης φλεγμονών σε εικόνες που προέρχονται από ενδοσκοπική κάψουλα, παρουσιάζεται μια προσέγγιση που χρησιμοποιεί Παραγωγικά Αντιπαραθετικά Δίκτυα (Generative Adversarial Networks, GAN) για τη δημιουργία συνθετικών εικόνων. Πιο συγκεκριμένα, η μελέτη βασίζεται στην εκπαίδευση δύο GAN, ένα για να την παραγωγή υγιών εικόνων του λεπτού εντέρου και ένα άλλο, για την παραγωγή εικόνων με φλεγμονές. Οι παραγόμενες εικόνες στη συνέχεια χρησιμοποιούνται για την εκπαίδευση ενός CNN με στόχο την αξιολόγηση της αποδοτικότητάς του σε πραγματικές εικόνες. Τα αποτελέσματα αυτής της μελέτης δείχνουν ότι η αντικατάσταση πραγματικών με τεχνητά παραγόμενων ενδοσκοπικών εικόνων για εκπαίδευση στο CNN μπορεί να είναι μια βιώσιμη επιλογή.Η αξιοσημείωτη απόδοση των CNN στον τομέα της υπολογιστικής όρασης, συνήθως, συνοδεύεται από αυξημένο υπολογιστικό κόστος. Αυτό περιορίζει τη χρήση τους σε συσκευές υψηλών υπολογιστικών προδιαγραφών εξοπλισμένες με πολλαπλές κάρτες γραφικών. Για την αντιμετώπιση αυτού του προβλήματος, μια τυπική προσέγγιση είναι η μείωση των απαιτούμενων αριθμητικών πράξεων, σε βάρος της απόδοσης γενίκευσης. Σε αυτό το πλαίσιο, προτάθηκε μια νέα αρχιτεκτονική CNN, εμπνευσμένη από την LB-FCN, με όνομα LB-FCN light. Η αρχιτεκτονική διαθέτει χαμηλό αριθμό ελεύθερων παραμέτρων και πράξεων, ενώ παράλληλα διατηρεί υψηλή απόδοση γενίκευσης. Η απόδοση του δικτύου διερευνήθηκε στο πρόβλημα της ανίχνευσης σκαλών σε εσωτερικούς και εξωτερικούς χώρους, με εφαρμογές στην υποβοηθούμενη πλοήγηση ατόμων με προβλήματα όρασης. Τα αποτελέσματα από την πειραματική αξιολόγηση του LB-FCN light δείχνουν πως απόδοσή του είναι υψηλότερη σε σύγκριση με άλλες, σύγχρονες αρχιτεκτονικές CNNs. Η ανάπτυξη εύχρηστων πλαισίων εφαρμογών μηχανικής μάθησης, δίνει την δυνατότητα ανάπτυξης προηγμένων εφαρμογών τεχνητής νοημοσύνης με μόνο λίγες γραμμές κώδικα. Ωστόσο, η εγκατάσταση αλγορίθμων μηχανικής μάθησης σε απομακρυσμένο περιβάλλον υψηλής απόδοσης, που περιλαμβάνει περίπλοκα επίπεδα επεξεργασίας δεδομένων, εξακολουθεί να είναι δύσκολη, ειδικά όταν τα περιβάλλοντα αυτά προορίζονται για χρήση από επιχειρήσεις. Για την αντιμετώπιση αυτού του προβλήματος, παρουσιάζεται μια νέα αρχιτεκτονική συστήματος, η οποία επιτρέπει την εκτέλεση εργασιών μηχανικής μάθησης για εφαρμογές υψηλής απόδοσης, με όνομα Algorithm-agnostic, Scalable Machine Learning (ASML). Στόχος της αρχιτεκτονικής είναι να δώσει μια απάντηση στο ερευνητικό πρόβλημα της σχεδίας και ανάπτυξης πλαισίου εφαρμογής, κατάλληλο για την ανάπτυξη διεργασιών μηχανικής μάθησης με γενικό και τυποποιημένο τρόπο, ανεξάρτητο του αλγορίθμου μηχανικής μάθησης. Η αρχιτεκτονική διαχειρίζεται την οριζόντια κλιμάκωση, τον προγραμματισμό εργασιών, την αναφορά, την παρακολούθηση και την εκτέλεση εργασιών μηχανικής μάθησης, με δυνατότητα χρήσης από πολλαπλούς χρήστες, χρησιμοποιώντας ανεξάρτητα και επεκτάσιμα στοιχεία που αποκρύπτουν τις λεπτομέρειες εκτέλεσης των υποκείμενων αλγορίθμων. Η δυνατότητες της αρχιτεκτονικής διερευνήθηκαν σε εφαρμογές ανάλυσης ροών εικόνων από ιατρικά δεδομένα και στα πλαίσια της υποβοηθούμενης πλοήγηση ατόμων με προβλήματα όρασης. Τα αποτελέσματα των πειραμάτων που πραγματοποιήθηκαν δείχνουν ότι η αρχιτεκτονική είναι κατάλληλη για παράλληλη χρήση και σε κρίσιμα συστήματα.Τα συστήματα υποβοηθούμενης πλοήγησης απαιτούν την ανάπτυξη, αξιολόγηση και βελτιστοποίηση διαφορετικών αλγορίθμων για την ανίχνευση εμποδίων, την αναγνώριση και την αποφυγή τους, καθώς και τον σχεδιασμό διαδρομών. Η διαδικασία αυτή είναι ιδιαιτέρως επίπονη και δαπανηρή και απαιτεί επαναλαμβανόμενες μετρήσεις υπό σταθερές συνθήκες, κάτι που συνήθως είναι δύσκολο να επιτευχθεί. Για το σκοπό αυτό, παρουσιάζεται ένα πρωτότυπο πλαίσιο εφαρμογής για την προσομοίωση και την αξιολόγηση συστημάτων υποβοήθησης πλοήγησης. Το πλαίσιο αυτό μπορεί να αναπαράγει πραγματικές καταστάσεις, επιτρέποντας την αξιολόγηση και βελτιστοποίηση αλγορίθμων μέσω ρυθμιζόμενων και οικονομικά αποδοτικών προσομοιώσεων. Η χρησιμότητα και η αποτελεσματικότητα του πλαισίου αποδεικνύονται με μια ενδεικτική μελέτη προσομοίωσης στο πλαίσιο ενός φορητού συστήματος που βασίζεται σε κάμερα για την πλοήγηση ατόμων με προβλήματα όρασης σε έναν υπαίθριο χώρο πολιτιστικού ενδιαφέροντος.Το έργο που παρουσιάστηκε στην παρούσα διατριβή περιλαμβάνει μεθόδους με θεωρητικό και πρακτικό αντίκτυπο, οι οποίες μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν ως βάση για περαιτέρω έρευνα. Οι εφαρμογές που παρουσιάζονται μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν ως πρότυπα για εφαρμογές σε διαφορετικούς τομείς, όπως τηλεϊατρική, ρομποτική και έξυπνα συστήματα μετακίνησης",health,836,not included
,to_check,core,,01/01/2020 00:00,core,αριστοτέλειο πανεπιστήμιο θεσσαλονίκης (απθ),,"Ageing consists one of the biggest societal challenges worldwide. Older adults’ desire of staying healthy, staying at their own home consists an important motive for the development of assistive technologies that will realize it through remote monitoring technologies. Proliferation of low-cost, off-the-shelf IoT devices has led to the implementation of the so called smart homes projects, which are solutions that are mixing the older adults’ physical spaces with monitoring and computing capabilities, allowing the collection of high-frequency daily life data. Methods: This stydy consist of two parts. An experimental one that takes place in a lab space and a real life application of sensor monitoring technology. In particular, an ecologically valid space was created within the Thessaloniki Active & Healthy Ageing Living, where fifteen (15) older adults participated in the pilot testing of the technology. Participants visited the ecologically valid space for almost two weeks, covering eight (8) 1 hour-sessions in total. There, they followed a protocol of typical daily life activities, where several unobtrusive scenario of monitoring were interweaved. No restrictions were imposed with respect to the execution of tasks, thus making sure that the data collection follows an ecologically valid paradigm. Subsequently, senor data collected from 10 participants were statistically correlated to clinical assessment tools. Then, a series of focus groups openly discussing about technology and obtrusiveness were carried out with thirteen participants. Moving to the second part of the study, some adjustments with respect to the technology had to be considered according to the Living Lab study findings. Favorable technology was installed to 5 older womens’ homes for more than a year time resulting to hundreds of thousands data points to be collected. Different modeling techniques were employed, such as statistical modeling, and machine learning, in order to explore clinical added value of digital biomarkers. As an application scenario, the study of modelling emotional disturbances and in particular the one of geriatric depression was carried out. In addition, a longitudinal study about sensor monitoring unobtrusiveness was conducted to examine end-user acceptance. A follow-up interview was carried out with each one of the participants. Finally, we explore the possibility of mapping the results of the data-driven modelling approaches with expert-driven models and knowledge representation schemata, such as the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) in a way that is transparent to the clinicians. Results: With respect to the first part of the study quite a few statistical significant correlations between sensor data and clinical tools were found, e.g. mobility and affective characteristics linked to emotional health and quality of life. With respect to the results of the focus groups these were transcribed and analysed with qualitative methods in order to extract the most significant themes and to categorize them to one of the obtrusiveness framework axes. For the second part o fthe study, a generalized linear mixed prediction model of PHQ-9 was developed utilizing information about TV usage patterns. Random Forests achieved mean accuracy score >80% when given to classify between healthy and depressive cases, while another RF classifier achieved an AUC>90% when having to deal with all sorts of depressive synptoms severity (from mild to severe). The initial FCM model also achieved a high classification rate up to 96% given some synthetic cases provided by experts. Finally, older adults’ longitudinal attitudes revealed a negative stance towards the use of the mirror camera and the smart watch, as well as the Kinect device. The answers to the questionnaire of the lady that left the study at month 12, were compared against the mean value of the rest four particpants to check for any particular reasons of her decision. Significant differences from the mean value of the rest four were found for the Kinect device, the smart watch and the mirror camera. Conclusions: Clinical value of digital biomarkers has been been revealed in many publications, yet their application in longitudinal studies is absent. A great challenge nowadays remains the robust operation of such technologies under real life circumstances, without any restrictions (in the wild) as well as their acceptance from older people, and their doctors, if at any time in the future we wish to integrate such data in the clinical practice.Η γήρανση του πληθυσμού αποτελεί μία από τις μεγαλύτερες κοινωνικές προκλήσεις σε ολόκληρο τον πλανήτη. Η επιθυμία των ηλικιωμένων για καλή γήρανση, παραμένοντας στο σπίτι τους αποτελεί σημαντικό παράγοντα για την ανάπτυξη υποστηρικτικών τεχνολογιών που θα προσφέρουν αυτήν την δυνατότητα μέσω τεχνολογιών απομακρυσμένης παρακολούθησης. Η εξάπλωση φθηνών έξυπνων συσκευών άμεσα διαθέσιμων στο εμπόριο και με την δυνατότητα σύνδεσης στο λεγόμενο Διαδίκτυο των Πραγμάτων (Internet of Things - IoT) έχει στρέψει την ερευνητική κοινότητα στην ανάπτυξη των λεγόμενων έξυπνων σπιτιών. Τα έξυπνα σπίτια αποτελούν λύσεις που συνδυάζουν τεχνολογίες αισθητήρων ενσωματώνοντάς τες στον φυσικό περιβάλλοντα χώρο των σπιτιών των ηλικιωμένων, επιτρέποντας την συνεχή και λεπτομερή παρακολούθηση των καθημερινών δραστηριότητων τους. Μέθοδοι: Η μελέτη μας αποτελείται από δύο σκέλη. Ένα πειραματικό σε εργαστηριακό χώρο και μια εφαρμογή της τεχνολογίας σε πραγματικό περιβάλλον. Συγκεκριμένα, δημιουργήθηκε ένας οικολογικά έγκυρος χώρος στα πλαίσια του Ζωντανού Εργαστηρίου Ενεργού και Υγιούς Γήρανσης, όπου δέκα πέντε (15) ηλικιωμένοι συμμετέχοντες έλαβαν μέρος στην πιλοτική δοκιμή της τεχνολογίας. Οι συμμετέχοντες επισκέπτονταν τον οικολογικά έγκυρο χώρο για περίπου 2 εβδομάδες (8 συνολικά συνεδρίες) όπου ακολουθούσαν ένα πρωτόκολλο δραστηριοτήτων, που περιελάμβαναν ορισμένα διακριτικά σενάρια παρακολούθησης, χωρίς αυστηρούς περιορισμούς επιτρέποντας την συλλογή ρεαλιστικών συμπεριφορικών δεδομένων από το δίκτυο αισθητήρων. Στην συνέχεια τα δεδομένα που συλλλέχθηκαν από 10 συμμετέχοντες αναλύθηκαν στατιστικά με τα κλινικά τεστ αξιολόγησης της υγείας των ηλικιωμένων ώστε να βρεθούν τυχόν συσχετίσεις και δείκτες υγείας. Μετά το πέρας αυτών των πιλοτικών δοκιμών πραγματοποιήθηκε μια σειρά από ομάδες εστιασμένης συζήτησης όπου πραγματοποιήθηκε κουβέντα γύρω από την παρεμβατικότητα της τεχνολογίας με την υιοθέτηση ενός θεωρητικού πλαισίου ορισμού από την βιβλιογραφία. Στο δεύτερο μέρος της μελέτης, μελετήθηκαν τα αποτελέσματα τόσο από την ποιοτική ανάλυση των ομάδων εστίασης, όσο και από τα μελή της ερευνητικής ομάδας και πραγματοποιήθηκε η εγκατάσταση ενός ελαφρώς τροποποιημένου τεχνολογικού συστήματος σε 5 σπίτια ηλικιωμένων για ένα διάστημα πλέον του ενός έτους, συλλέγοντας με αυτόν τον τρόπο εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες ψηφιακά στιγμιότυπα της καθημερινότητας των ηλικιωμένων. Στην συνέχεια επιχειρήθηκε η ανάπτυξη τόσο στατιστικών μοντέλων, όσο και μοντέλων μηχανικής μάθησης για την διερεύνηση της κλινικής αξίας των ψηφιακών βιοδεικτών. Σαν μελέτη εφαρμογής αυτών των μοντέλων ήταν η πρόβλεψη συναισθηματικών διαταραχών καθώς και της καταθλιπτικής συμπτωματολογίας. Παράλληλα με αυτές τις μελέτες, διενεργήθηκε και μια μακροπρόθεσμη (Longitudinal) μελέτη της αποδοχής των αισθητήρων από τους ηλικιωμένους με έμφαση και πάλι στον βαθμό παρεμβατικότητας. Η μελέτη διενεργήθηκε με την μορφή προσωπικών συνεντεύξεων με κάθε μία από τις πέντε συμμετέχουσες. Τέλος, με την πρόταση και δημιουργία ενός εμπειρικού μοντέλου (expert model) υποστήριξης της διάγνωσης της γηριατρικής κατάθλιψης (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps), αποκρυσταλλώνοντας την γνώση των ειδικών σε ένα σχήμα αναπαράστασης γνώσης προσιτό σε αυτούς, επιχειρείται η αντιστοίχηση της νέας γνώσης που παράγεται από τους αισθητήρες με την υπάρχουσα κλινική γνώση. Αποτελέσματα: Όσον αφορά το πρώτο σκέλος της διατριβής βρέθηκαν αρκετές στατιστικά σημαντικές συσχετίσεις ανάμεσα στις επιμέρους κατηγορίες ψηφιακών δεικτών, όπως κινητικοί, συναισθηματικοί και φυσιολογικοί και των επιμέρους κατηγοριών κλινικών αξιολογήσεων της υγείας των ηλικιωμένων. Όσον αφορά τα αποτελέσματα από τις ομάδες εστιασμένης συζήτησης αυτά αναλύθηκαν με ποιοτικές μεθόδους για να εξαχθούν τα πιο βασικά θέματα που προέκυψαν από τις συζητήσεις και να κατηγοριοποιηθούν σε κάθε ένα από τους άξονες του πλαισίου παρεμβατικότητας (obtrusiveness framework). Για το δεύτερο σκέλος της διατριβής, δημιουργήθηκε ένα γραμμικό μοντέλο πρόβλεψης του PHQ-9 σκορ από τα μοτίβα λειτουργίας της τηλεόρασης. Εκεί βρέθηκαν συσχετίσεις με κάποια από τα συμπτώματα της κατάθλιψης. Το μοντέλο μηχανικής μάθησης και συγκεκριμένα, Τυχαία Δάση (Random Forests, RF) πέτυχαν με ακρίβεια άνω του 80% να διακρίνουν μεταξύ καταθλιπτικών και υγιών καθημερινών στιγμυοτύπων συμπεριφοράς, ενώ το μοντέλο ταξινόμησης καθημερινών προτύπων συμπεριφοράς σε ήπια, μέτρια και σοβαρά καταθλιπτικά περιστατικά πέτυχε εμβαδόν επιφάνειας ROC >90%. Επίσης, η αρχική αξιολόγηση του μοντέλου υποστήριξης της διάγνωσης της κατάθλιψης, με βάση το σχήμα αναπαράστασης γνώσης FCM είχε μέση ακρίβεια περίπου 96%. Τέλος, η σύγκριση των μοτίβων αντίληψης των ηλικιωμένων όσον αφορά την παρεμβατικότητα των τεχνολογιών που είχαν εγκατεστημένες στο σπίτι τους, απεκάλυψε την αρνητική τους στάση απέναντι στο έξυπνο ρολόι και τον καθρέφτη-κάμερα. Επίσης, καθώς μία από τις 5 κυρίες απεχώρησε οικιοθελώς από την μελέτη, συγκρίθηκαν οι απαντήσεις της με τον μέσο όρο των υπολοίπων ηλικιωμένων γυναικών. ώστε να αποκαλυφθούν οι αιτίες της αποχώρησης από την μελέτη. Βασικοί λόγοι αποδείχθηκαν το έξυπνο ρολόι, ο καθρέφτης με την ενσωματωμένη κάμερα αλλά και η συσκευή Kinect λόγω και της οποίας αναγκάστηκε να αλλάξει την καθημερινή ρουτίνα της. Συμπεράσματα: Η κλινική αξία των ψηφιακών βιοδεικτών έχει αναδειχθεί σε πλήθος δημοσιεύσεων, όμως η χρήση και αξιολόγησή τους σε μακροπρόθεσμες μελέτες απουσιάζει. Μεγάλη πρόκληση αποτελεί στις μέρες μας η εύρωστη λειτουργία τέτοιων τεχνολογιών υπό πραγματικές συνθήκες χωρίς πριορισμούς (in the wild) αλλά και η αποδοχή τους τόσο από τους ηλικιωμένους, όσο και από τους γιατρούς αν κάποια στιγμή στο μέλλον θελήσουμε να χρησιμοποιήσουμε τέτοιου είδους δεδομένα στην κλινική πράξη",health,837,not included
,to_check,core,,01/01/2020 00:00,core,'now publishers',,"Climate econometrics is a new sub-discipline that has grown rapidly over the last few years. As greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are a major cause of climate change, and are generated by human activity, it is not surprising that the tool set designed to empirically investigate economic outcomes should be applicable to studying many empirical aspects of climate change.

Economic and climate time series exhibit many commonalities. Both data are subject to non-stationarities in the form of evolving stochastic trends and sudden distributional shifts. Consequently, the well-developed machinery for modeling economic time series can be fruitfully applied to climate data. In both disciplines, we have imperfect and incomplete knowledge of the processes actually generating the data. As we don’t know that data generating process (DGP), we must search for what we hope is a close approximation to it. The data modeling approach adopted at Climate Econometrics (http://www.climateeconometrics.org/) is based on a model selection methodology that has excellent properties for locating an unknown DGP nested within a large set of possible explanations, including dynamics, outliers, shifts, and non-linearities. The software we use is a variant of machine learning which implements multi-path block searches commencing from very general specifications to discover a well-specified and undominated model of the processes under analysis. To do so requires implementing indicator saturation estimators designed to match the problem faced, such as impulse indicators for outliers, step indicators for location shifts, trend indicators for trend breaks, multiplicative indicators for parameter changes, and indicators specifically designed for more complex phenomena that have a common reaction ‘shape’ like the impacts of volcanic eruptions on temperature reconstructions. We also use combinations of these, inevitably entailing settings with more candidate variables than observations.

Having described these econometric tools, we take a brief excursion into climate science to provide the background to the later applications. By noting the Earth’s available atmosphere and water resources, we establish that humanity really can alter the climate, and is doing so in myriad ways. Then we relate past climate changes to the ‘great extinctions’ seen in the geological record. Following the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, building on earlier advances in scientific, technological and medical knowledge, real income levels per capita have risen dramatically globally, many killer diseases have been tamed, and human longevity has approximately doubled. However, such beneficial developments have led to a global explosion in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. These are also subject to many relatively sudden shifts from major wars, crises, resource discoveries, technology and policy interventions. Consequently, stochastic trends, large shifts and numerous outliers must all be handled in practice to develop viable empirical models of climate phenomena. Additional advantages of our econometric methods for doing so are detecting the impacts of important policy interventions as well as improved forecasts. The econometric approach we outline can handle all these jointly, which is essential to accurately characterize non-stationary observational data. Few approaches in either climate or economic modeling consider all such effects jointly, but a failure to do so leads to mis-specified models and hence incorrect theory evaluation and policy analyses. We discuss the hazards of modeling wide-sense non-stationary data (namely data not just with stochastic trends but also distributional shifts), which also serves to describe our notation.

The application of the methods is illustrated by two detailed modeling exercises. The first investigates the causal role of CO2 in Ice Ages, where a simultaneous-equations system is developed to characterize land ice volume, temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels as non-linear functions of measures of the Earth’s orbital path round the Sun. The second turns to analyze the United Kingdom’s highly non-stationary annual CO2 emissions over the last 150 years, walking through all the key modeling stages. As the first country into the Industrial Revolution, the UK is one of the first countries out, with per capita annual CO2 emissions now below 1860’s levels when our data series begin, a reduction achieved with little aggregate cost. However, very large decreases in all greenhouse gas emissions are still required to meet the UK’s 2050 target set by its Climate Change Act in 2008 of an 80% reduction from 1970 levels, since reduced to a net zero target by that date, as required globally to stabilize temperatures. The rapidly decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies offer hope of further rapid emission reductions in that area, illustrated by a dynamic scenario analysis",health,838,not included
,to_check,core,,28/08/2020 00:00,core,'victoria university of wellington library',,"Robots are entering our daily lives from self-driving cars to health-care robots. Historically, pre-programmed robots were vulnerable to changing conditions in daily life, primarily because of a lack of ability to generate novel, non-preset flexible solutions. Thus there is a need for robotics to incorporate adaptation, which is a trait of higher order natural species. This adaptation allows higher-order natural species to change their behaviours and internal mechanisms based on experience with often dynamic environment. The ability to adapt emerged through evolutionary processes.
Evolutionary Robotics is an approach to create autonomous robots that are capable of automatically generating artificial behaviors and morphologies to achieve adaptation. Evolutionary robotics has the potential to automatically synthesize controllers for real autonomous robots and generate solutions to complete tasks in the uncertain real-world. Compared to the inflexibility of pre-programmed robots, evolutionary robots are able to learn flexible solutions to given tasks through evolutionary methods.

Cognitive robotics, a branch of artificial cognitive systems research, is such an attempt to create autonomous robots by applying bio-inspired methods. As the robot interacts with environment, an underlying cognitive system can learn its own solutions toward task completion. This learning-solution-from-interaction approach, also termed as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, is widely applied in cognitive robotics to learn the solutions automatically. Ideally, the solutions can emerge in the cognitive system through the trial-and-error process of the RL approach without introducing human bias.

This thesis aims to develop an evolutionary cognitive architecture (system) for a robot that can learn adaptive solutions to complete tasks. Inspired by emotion theories, this work proposes Affective Computing Multilayer Cognitive Architecture (ACMCA), a universal cognitive architecture, which is able to learn diverse solutions. Extending from previous work, ACMCA has a five-layer structure, where each layer aims to achieve different components of the solutions. The position of this thesis is that introducing a novel emotion inspired multilayer architecture that produces task solutions through subsumption operations and underlying appropriate machine learning algorithms will allow a robot to complete admissible tasks.

ACMCA’s five layers are: primary reinforcer layer, secondary reinforcer layer, core affect state layer, strategy layer, and behaviour layer. This five-layer decomposition also meets the traditional decomposition of a mobile control system into functional modules (e.g. perception, modelling, planning, task execution, and motor control). Each layer contains computing nodes as functional modules that process various Stimuli, Actions, and their consequential Outcomes of the cognitive system. In this work, 17 computing nodes and their connections in ACMCA represent the solutions that a mobile robot has learned to complete navigation tasks in complex scenarios.

Inspired by the Constructive Theory 1 and the robotic subsumption system, this work proposes a contingency-based subsumption approach to construct ACMCA. This contingency is termed Stimuli-Action-Outcome Contingency (SAOC), which is extended from the Action-Outcome (AO) contingency of Construction Theory. SAOCs are represented by “if-then” rules, termed SAOC rules, which encapsulate Stimuli, Actions, and their consequential Outcomes, providing clear symbolic interpretations. That is, the symbolic meaning of a SAOC rule can be interpreted as: if the input stimulus is perceived, the output action will be advocated as a cognitive response, expecting the outcome of the action with an estimation of relevance. As low-level computing nodes encapsulate Stimulus, Actions, and Outcomes, high-level computing nodes can subsume these low-level ones through the form of SAOC rules. Therefore, the proposed ACMCA can be constructed by subsumption layers of Stimuli-Action-Outcome Contingency (SAOC) rules.

This work applies machine learning techniques to facilitate ACMCA’s real-world robotic implementation. This work selects Accuracy-based Learning Classifier Systems (XCS) algorithms as the underlying machine learning techniques that are deployed at computing nodes for the contingency-based subsumption operations. The mitosis approach of XCS and the XCS with a Combined Reward method (XCSCR) are two novel variants of XCS algorithm. They are proposed to amend two challenges that occur when the standard XCS approaches are applied for robotic applications. The mitosis approach introduces an accuracy pressure into the algorithm’s evolutionary process, improving the algorithms’ performance in robotic applications where noisy interferences exist. The XCSCR enables the policy to emerge earlier and more frequently than the existing benchmark approaches in multistep problems. Therefore, a robot with the XCSCR can handle a multistep scenario more effectively than those with the benchmarked algorithms.

This work conducts five experiments to test the capability of ACMCA and its underlying algorithms in learning solutions for robotic navigation tasks. The five experiments are conducted as follows: reflex-learning, IR-tuning, deliberation-establishing, emotion model, and combined reward assignment. As the results of the experiments, three different affective patterns have emerged in the first three experiments, an emotion model has emerged in the fourth experiments, and the fifth experiment explores ACMCA’s potential implementation in the life-long learning scenario.

These results demonstrate that ACMCA, a novel emotion inspired multilayer architecture, can produce task solutions through contingency-based subsumption operations and underlying appropriate machine learning algorithms, allowing a robot to complete admissible tasks through evolutionary processes. The contingency-based subsumption operations can establish three contingencies and one emotion model between the subsumed components by multiple RL agents which deploy the proposed mitosis approach of XCS algorithms. These three emotion patterns and emotion model can consistently improve the robot’s navigation performance with interpretable explanations. These two variants of XCS algorithms can amend shortfalls of the standard XCS approach in real-world robotic implementations. It has been demonstrated that the diverse solutions learned by ACMCA improve the navigation performance of the robot in terms of higher flexibility, reduction in continuous collisions and shorter navigation time consumption",health,839,not included

This disease is classified in five progressive stages (1>2>3>4>5), and it is shocking to know that 70% of the patients that start Kidney Replacement Therapy (KRT), only in the last stage, do not know they were previously infected by it. It is clear that those patients in the early stages of CKD are underdiagnosed and deprived of health policies to optimize diagnosis and to warn them of the need for KRT and of the catastrophic cardiovascular outcomes that are the main cause of death in this segment. The barriers identified for kidney care were the factors related to the knowledge and attitude of physicians and patients, besides the geography. In this context, there is a need to develop well-designed strategies to guide decision-making and enhance the care for patients with CKD. In this, work, we aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence tool called ontology, with a view to optimizing the early diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Health Care. For this purpose, after acquiring knowledge about the disease domain, we drew up the global guideline for the assistance of the patient with kidney disease in the form of a Rule-Based System that was subsequently implemented manually following the model 101 for construction of ontologies in the Protégé software, an ontology editor, having as its reasoning element the Hermit, for the necessary inferences. Accordingly, the constructed ontology called ONTODRC is characterized as a Clinical Decision Support System that has been validated computationally and in real HULW cases. After validating ONTODRC, we applied it in a sample of 185 primary care physicians in the town of João Pessoa, in two moments. In the first one, we applied a questionnaire to assess the pre and post knowledge on ONTODRC; and, in the second, we measured the perception of ease and usefulness of the tool with the technology acceptance model (TAM). In order to assess the effect of the intervention in the Knowledge assessment, we used the McNemar’s Test; and, to check the reliability of the TAM constructs, we used the Cronbach’s Alpha indicator (C.A.). In the results, we noted that the constructed ontology has an approximate capacity to respond to 90% of the surveyed requirements and also has the capacity to bring knowledge to the users. In turn, these users have considered the tool as useful and easy in their daily lives. We can conclude that the ONTODRC has the capacity to optimize the early diagnosis of CKD, in order to provide human, economic and environmental benefits.NenhumaA Doença Renal Crônica (DRC) é um problema de saúde pública, que acomete cerca de 10% da população adulta mundial, com mortalidade de 15% ao ano. Classificada em cinco estágios (1>2>3>4>5) progressivos, sendo chocante saber que 70% dos pacientes que entram em Terapia Renal Substitutiva (TRS), apenas, no último estágio, desconhecem ser portador da doença, previamente. Fica claro que, aqueles pacientes nos estágios iniciais da DRC estão subdiagnosticados e carentes de políticas de saúde para otimização do diagnóstico, para prevenção da necessidade de TRS e dos desfechos cardiovasculares catastróficos que são a principal causa de óbito neste segmento. As barreiras identificadas para o cuidado renal foram fatores relacionados ao conhecimento e atitude de médicos e pacientes e a geografia. Neste contexto, há necessidade de desenvolver estratégias bem desenhadas para orientar a tomada de decisão e melhorar a prestação de cuidados aos pacientes com DRC. Neste trabalho, objetivou-se desenvolver uma ferramenta da Inteligência Artificial denominada ontologia, a fim de otimizar o diagnóstico precoce da Doença Renal Crônica, na Atenção Primária à Saúde. Para tanto, após aquisição do conhecimento sobre o domínio da doença foi modelada a diretriz mundial para a assistência do nefropata na forma de um Sistema Baseado em Regras que a seguir foi implementada manualmente seguindo o modelo 101 para construção de ontologias no software Protégé, um editor de ontologias, tendo como raciocinador o Hermit para as inferências necessárias.

Para avaliar o efeito da intervenção na Avaliação do conhecimento foi utilizado o Teste de McNemar e para verificar a fidedignidade dos constructos da TAM foi utilizado o indicador Alfa de Conbrach (A.C.). Nos resultados obteve-se que a ontologia construída possui capacidade aproximada de responder a 90 % dos requisitos levantados e tem capacidade de levar conhecimento aos usuários.

Using the state-of-the-art machine learning based classification techniques plays a crucial role in creating the optimal healthcare system on the edge. This thesis first provides a background on the current and emerging edge computing classification techniques for healthcare applications, specifically for electrocardiogram (ECG) beat classification. We then present key findings from an extensive survey of over hundred studies on the topic while taxonomizing the literature with respect to key architectural differences, application areas and requirements.  Leveraging the insights drawn from the extensive analysis of the pertinent literature we select a set of most promising machine learning based classification techniques for ECG beats, based on their suitability for implementation on a small edge device called a Raspberry Pi. After implementing these classification techniques on a Raspberry Pi based platform we perform a comparison of the performance of these classification techniques with respect to three key performance indicators (KPI) of interest for health care applications namely accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency.
ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart and help healthcare professionals to evaluate heart conditions of a patient, sometimes diagnosing life-threatening conditions. The features of ECG signals are pre-processed and fed into the classification algorithms to detect and classify abnormal beat types.  ECG classification requires low complexity but still high level of performance in terms of aforementioned three KPIs. The classification algorithms chosen, namely Naïve Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and distilled deep neural network (DNN) are all energy efficient methods hence suitable for implementation for small edge devices. The comparative multi-faceted evaluation presented in this thesis is a new contribution to research that exists on edge based classification as it offers comparison of selected classification algorithms in terms three KPIs instead of one while using real edge device based implementation. The performance of analyzed machine learning classification techniques is ranked according to each KPI. Benefiting from the results of the comparative analysis presented in this thesis a particular classification algorithm can be selected for optimal deployment in given scenario in healthcare system depending on the specific requirements of the given scenario. Edge computing paves the way for a new generation of health devices that can offer a higher quality of life for users if low-latency, low-energy, and high- performance requirements are addressed",health,842,not included

Although running such workflows in clouds promises reduces operational costs, there are still numerous scheduling challenges to overcome. Such complex workflows are dynamic, exhibit periodic patterns, and combine diverse task groupings and requirements. In this work, we propose ANANKE, a scheduling system addressing these challenges. Our approach extends the state-of-the-art in portfolio scheduling for datacenters with a reinforcement-learning technique, and proposes various scheduling policies for managing complex workflows. Portfolio scheduling addresses the dynamic aspect of the workload. Reinforcement learning, based in this work on Q-learning, allows our approach to adapt to the periodic patterns of the workload, and to tune the other configuration parameters. The proposed policies are heuristics that guide the provisioning process, and map workflow tasks to the provisioned cloud resources. Through real-world experiments based on real and synthetic industrial workloads, we analyze and compare our prototype implementation of ANANKE with a system without portfolio scheduling (baseline) and with a system equipped with a standard portfolio scheduler. Overall, our experimental results give evidence that a learningbased portfolio scheduler can perform better (5–20%) and cost less (20–35%) than the considered alternatives.Distributed System",health,843,not included

With the development of immunoassy, traditional detection methods in clinical diagnostics have been replaced by many new techniques. One of the new techniques is the gold immunochromato- graphic assay (GICA). With the advantages of high efficiency of detection, easy of operation, pllution free and reagent stable, GICA has gained great attention in clinical diagnostics.       Because of its characteristics of convenient, fast and efficient, POCT (Point of Care Testing) has attracted much research interest and been rapid developed at home and abroad in recent years. With the implementation of China''s medical reform and the improvement of knowledge of disease prevention and health, POCT will play an increasingly important role in health care, disease prevention and monitoring in the future.       However, the performance of POCT instrument for colloidal gold lateral flow (LF) strip quantitative detection is low, and the price of imported POCT instrument is expensive. There are mainly two forms of measurements, i.e. scanning measurement and imaging measurement. For the scanning measurement, the measurement reproducibility would be affected by instrument vibration and other disturbing factors, and the measurement time is relatively long. Additionally, the scanning mechanism also complicates the instrument’s structure. As for the imaging measurement, the LF strip picture is captured by image sensor. And image processing methods are used for quantitative analysis of the LF strip. So the imaging measurement is quick, stable, and has simple mechanical structure, etc. However, the image quality of the LF strip would directly affect the detection performance of the instrument. For example, illumination uniformity on the LF strip and the control parameters of image sensor has great impact on the image quality, and thus affect the measurement results. But the reported imaging measurement-based instruments are rarely concerned about the design of illumination uniformity and the control parameters.This situiation indicates that the research and development of high performance POCT instrument for colloidal gold LF strip quantitative detection with Chinese independent intellectual property rights is of great significance and value.       Aiming at researching and designing POCT instrument based on image sensor for colloidal gold LF strip quantitative detection with properties of sensitive, reproducible, fast, stable, portable, low power consumption, low cost, simple structure, etc., the main research work in this paper is as follows:       (1) An overview of the development and application of POCT and of the development of DSP technology, as well as of the development of POCT instrument for GICA quantitative detection is introduced.       (2) The GICA test strip quantitative detection theory, the optical properties of gold nanoparticles and the basic principles of immunogold labeling technique are analysed. Then deep researches on the colloidal gold LF strip structure and on the principle of the double-antibody sandwich GICA reaction have been done.       (3) The overall composition of the colloidal gold LF strip reader based on image sensor is researched and designed. The basic design modules of colloidal gold LF strip reader are introduced in three modules, i.e. optical module, control module and image algorithm module. Meanwhile, a new way to improve the performance of colloidal gold LF strip reader by the design of illumination uniformity and the optimization of image sensor’s image control parameters is proposed. Then, the basic design resources are introduced, including OV6630 image sensor, TMS320C6747 DSP chip and the embed real time operation system DSP/BIOS.       (4) The colloidal gold LF strip reader is researched and designed, including illumination uniformity design, image control parameters settings design of OV6630, internal hardwares operating methods and circuit connections, the software operation of C6747 DSP chip internal modules and the image data processing algorithms of quantitative detection. Two evaluation parameters are defined to evaluate the image for the optimization of image control parameters. At last, a prototype of colloidal gold LF strip reader has been developed on the basis of the detailed design, and the working process of this reader is introduced.       (5) Colloidal gold LF strips of Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are tested by the colloidal gold LF strip reader. The coefficients of variation of 20 times repetitive experiments with 0.25 ng/ml and 64 ng/ml are respectively 2.790% and 0.134%. The functional sensitivity is better than 0.25 ng/ml. The test results are fitted by 4-PL curve model, whose R^2 is more than 0.99, and the single measurement time is less than 1 sencond.

The diabetes predetecting program implemented on this final project is one of computer program which is used to be the secondary tool on medical field, it detects someone’s possibility of diabetes risk. Program works by gathering data from user then process it based on the rules base. This program was implemented using Ms. Visual Basic programming language and Ms. Access database, with forward chaining method on Artficial Intelligence scope. As the output, system will give result whether someone suffer from diabetes or not, with its diabetes type, diagnose, and recommendation. Technically, this program is still in its prototype, means that it needs further development. Diagnose result will be synchronized with standard medical threatment. So as the given recommendation. The program was tested to respondences with different input. In respondence testing, found that the program diagnose result has an accuracy value about 96,67 %. This means that forward chaining algorithm implemented on the software could result final decision which almost same as the doctor diagnose.Keyword: diabetes, expert system, diagnose, recommendation, forward chainin",health,850,not included
,to_check,core,,16/10/2010 00:00,core,university of verona,,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used in medical settings because of its ability to produce, non-invasively, high quality images of the inside of the human body. Since its introduction in early 70’s, more and more complex acquisition techniques have been proposed, raising MRI to be exploited in a wide spectrum of applications. Innovative MRI modalities, such as diffu- sion and functional imaging, require complex analysis techniques and advanced algorithms in order to extract useful information from the acquired data. The aim of the present work has been to develop and optimize state-of-the- art techniques to be applied in the analysis of MRI data both in experimental and clinical settings. During my doctoral program I have been actively involved in several research projects, each time facing many different issues. In this dissertation, however, I will report the results obtained in three most appealing projects I partecipated to. These projects were devoted (i) to the implementation of an innovative experimental protocol for functional MRI in laboratory animals, (ii) to the development of new methods for the analysis of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI data in experimental tumour models and (iii) to the analysis of diffusion MRI data in stroke patients. Particular emphasis will be given to the technical aspects regarding the algorithms and processing methods used in the analysis of data. Apart from a brief introduction on magnetic resonance imaging principles, the dissertation is organised in three parts, each one of them covering a separate topic dealt with during my doctoral studies. Each chapter is self-contained, in that it gives an introduction about the issue faced in the study, describes the methods and the techniques employed, and concludes with a discussion about the results obtained. Chapter 3 illustrates the methodology proposed by our group for an innovative method of fMRI (Activation-Induced Manganese Enhanced MRI, AIM-MRI) in rats. The method is based on in-vivo, absolute quantification of Mn concentration in different brain regions performed by fast T1 mapping and coregistration to a rat brain atlas. This strategy allows to quantify the accumulation of Mn in different regions of the rat brain, which is strictly related to the ac- tivation status of each area. This mechanism is similar to what happens in classical functional MRI studies but, in addition, it might be used for functional experiments performed in awake animals. In chapter 4 we cover the topic of tissues classification from MRI images in some experimental tumour models and present some advanced image-processing techniques we introduced for the analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCEMRI) data. In particular, we proposed to estimate a set of characteristic features from DCEMRI time profiles which well describe their shape, and then to extract peculiar behaviours which discriminate each tissue inside the tumour by combining cluster analysis and machine learning techniques. We have tested several approaches, each time comparing them with the state-of-the-art techniques of analysis for this kind of data. Finally, the proposed approach has been validated in a real case application in order to assess the efficacy of an anti-cancer therapy. Chapter 5 addresses the study on post-stroke plasticity carried out in collab- oration with the Signal Processing Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Brain structural connectivity was monitored with Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI), i.e. a high angular resolution diffusion MRI technique, during the functional recovery from the stroke, at hyperacute, acute and chronic stages after the lesion onset. The reproducibility of extracted fibre tracts has been extensively studied on healthy subjects, and the parameter set of fiber-tracking algorithm giving the best results was then used in patient analysis. The extracted fibre bundles between each pair of cortical regions were characterized by means of several connectivity measures",health,851,not included

The desired tasks for these systems include visual localization, depth estimation, 3D mapping, disease detection and segmentation, automated navigation, active control, path realization and optional therapeutic modules such as targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Data-driven algorithms promise to enable many advanced functionalities for capsule endoscopes, but real-world data is challenging to obtain. Physically-realistic simulations providing synthetic data have emerged as a solution to the development of data-driven algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation platform for capsule endoscopy operations and introduce VR-Caps, a virtual active capsule environment that simulates a range of normal and abnormal tissue conditions (e.g., inflated, dry, wet etc.) and varied organ types, capsule endoscope designs (e.g., mono, stereo, dual and 360°camera), and the type, number, strength, and placement of internal and external magnetic sources that enable active locomotion. VR-Caps makes it possible to both independently or jointly develop, optimize, and test medical imaging and analysis software for the current and next-generation endoscopic capsule systems. To validate this approach, we train state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accomplish various medical image analysis tasks using simulated data from VR-Caps and evaluate the performance of these models on real medical data. Results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed virtual platform in developing algorithms that quantify fractional coverage, camera trajectory, 3D map reconstruction, and disease classification.",health,852,not included
,to_check,project-academic,,17/03/2018 00:00,project-academic,the challenge of regulating clinical decision support software after 21st century cures,project-academic," Clinical decision support (CDS) software broadly refers to software that assists healthcare providers in combining patient-specific data with general sources of medical knowledge to make better diagnostic and treatment decisions in the clinical setting. The 21st-Century Cures Act strips FDA of jurisdiction to regulate some (not all) CDS software. To qualify for this exclusion from FDA regulation, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(o)(1)(E)(iii) requires that the software must be intended to enable “the health care professional to independently review the basis” for its recommendations so that it is “not the intent that such health care professional rely primarily” on the software’s recommendations when making diagnostic and treatment decisions about individual patients. This article explores whether this is a workable standard as applied to advanced CDS software that uses machine learning to glean insights from real-world clinical experience and then applies these insights to improve the quality of patient care. We conclude that the standard Congress set out in 21st-Century Cures is potentially workable, but only if FDA takes additional steps to clarify the standards of transparency that CDS software must meet before it can escape FDA regulation. Transparency in this context includes algorithmic transparency, physician access to the underlying data that the software relies on in rendering decisions, and business transparency as reflected in the terms of contracts between CDS software vendors and users. 
FDA’s recent draft guidance on CDS software leaves a crucial question unresolved. This question cuts to the very heart of what is wrong with the US healthcare system and how to fix it: Is the problem simply that doctors are not heeding existing medical evidence — for example, by ignoring warnings in FDA-approved drug labeling or failing to keep up with findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature? Or is the problem that the existing evidence base is itself inadequate and flawed — for example, because FDA-approved labeling relies on contrived clinical trials that fail to reflect real patients, or because peer-reviewed literature is skewed by publication biases that favor studies in which the treatment worked, or because clinical practice guidelines can be captured by commercial interests? FDA’s draft guidance on CDS software — perhaps as an unintended consequence — would expedite market entry for simple CDS software that promotes physician conformity with the existing medical evidence base, while imposing higher regulatory hurdles that delay the clinical translation of machine-learning software that may be our best hope to overcome flaws in current medical evidence? Is this the right path forward?",health,853,not included
,to_check,project-academic,,19/11/2019 00:00,project-academic,the human body is a black box supporting clinical decision making with deep learning,project-academic," Machine learning technologies are increasingly developed for use in healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to accuracy, fairness, accountability, and transparency that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain under examined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for designing machine learning systems. Our work underscores the limits of model interpretability as a solution to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in practice. Instead, our work demonstrates other means and goals to achieve FATML values in design and in practice.",health,854,included

L’innovazione tecnologica ha influenzato e condizionato le varie epoche, difatti, nel 1784 , con la prima rivoluzione industriale, si è assistito all'invenzione del telaio e del motore a vapore, per poi arrivare al 1890 dove l’invenzione dell’energia elettrica è stata sicuramente una delle scoperte più importanti, fino al 1970 in cui si è assistito al sopravvento dell’automazione e quindi alla costruzione dei primi computer. Arriviamo poi ai primi anni del 2000, dove in occasione della fiera di Hannover, per descrivere l’avvento della quarta rivoluzione industriale, fu coniato il termine “industria 4.0”, ad evidenziare il passaggio da un sistema basato unicamente sulle interazioni fisiche tra uomo e macchina ad uno in cui l’interazione tra dati e macchine costituisce la maggior parte delle operazioni produttive. Nel settore food, sia le ricerche che le innovazioni tecnologiche sono state condotte non solo da enti di ricerca ed università ma anche dalle start-up, al fine di ottenere miglioramenti tecnologici e prodotti finora sconosciuti.
Il termine start-up (dall'inglese “inizio”), indica l’avvio di una nuova impresa con tutto ciò che ne comporta sia dal punto di vista strutturale che organizzativo e quest’elaborato infatti, si basa sull'utilizzo del software SCM (Safeaty Content Management), nato dallo Spin-Off della Università di Pisa, ed applicato ad un servizio di catering aereo al fine di integrarsi nella gestione delle fasi che caratterizzano l’azienda stessa evidenziandone i vantaggi e le potenzialità.
La missione principale del software è quella di aiutare le aziende alimentari a redigere un piano di autocontrollo basato sul principio dell’ HACCP, senza incappare in errori o dimenticanze, il tutto a portata di un click. Il sistema HACCP sta alla base della piramide della sicurezza alimentare, ma prima ancora incontriamo il regolamento 178/02 e il pacchetto igiene. Il regolamento 178/02, costituisce la fonte primaria del moderno diritto alimentare europeo e racchiude in un unico testo i diritti ed i doveri di tutti gli operatori del settore alimentare, quindi sia quelli attribuiti agli OSA che quelli designati alle Autorità Competenti che effettuano i controlli in materia. Stabilisce inoltre i principi e i requisiti generali della legislazione alimentare segnando il passaggio da una moltitudine di normative nazionali, in attuazione delle direttive comunitarie ad un insieme razionale di regole comuni testualmente applicate nell'intero Mercato Unico. Con l’avvento di questa normativa poi, si è attribuita una responsabilità primaria del raggiungimento degli obiettivi, agli operatori del settore alimentare; il compito di verifica invece, alle autorità di controllo. Si arriva poi al pacchetto igiene, un insieme di quattro testi legislativi, pubblicati per la prima volta nel 2004 ma entrati in vigore il 1° gennaio del 2006, e nominati: Regolamento 852/04, Regolamento 853/04, Regolamento 854/04 e regolamento 882/04 (gli ultimi due regolamenti sono stati abrogati e sostituiti dal Regolamento 625/2017).
I primi due regolamenti, sono indirizzati alle responsabilità che gli OSA devono ottemperare per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi di sicurezza; gli ultimi, invece, sono destinati alle autorità di controllo. Arriviamo così all’HACCP, acronimo di “Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points”, ovvero “Analisi del pericolo e punti critici di controllo” che costituisce un valido sistema, organizzato e razionale oltre che condiviso a livello europeo, per l’applicazione dell’autocontrollo degli operatori che operano nelle industrie che trattano, manipolano o distribuiscono alimenti.
L’applicazione del sistema HACCP nasce proprio dall'esigenza di garantire la salubrità delle produzioni alimentari cambiando approccio, cioè passando da un controllo a valle del processo produttivo, che esisteva in passato ed effettuava il controllo sul prodotto finito, ad un controllo del processo produttivo in ogni sua fase, identificando quindi tutti i rischi che possono influire sulla sicurezza degli alimenti e attuando tutte le misure preventive necessarie a tenerli sotto controllo. Per cui, da un controllo di prodotto di tipo tradizionale, si è passati ad un controllo di processo, cioè il controllo di tipo moderno. In Italia è stato introdotto nel 1997, dal D.lgs 155 del ’97. Attualmente è in vigore poiché contemplato dal Regolamento CE 852 del 2004, il quale ha abrogato il precedente D.lgs 155 del ’97. Lo sviluppo del metodo HACCP prevede che debbano essere attuati e rispettati i cosiddetti “programmi prerequisito” o PRPs, cioè delle condizioni di base ed attività necessarie a mantenere un ambiente in condizioni consone per la preparazione di prodotti sani e sicuri per il consumo umano.
L’efficacia di questo metodo però si completa pienamente solo con l’ottemperanza a 5 fasi preliminari (costituzione dell’HACCP team, descrizione del prodotto, descrizione dei possibili usi, realizzazione di un diagramma di flusso, verifica in campo) e 7 principi (analisi dei pericoli, individuazione dei CCP, definizione dei limiti critici, definizione dei monitoraggi, individuazione delle azioni correttive, verifica dell’efficacia del sistema e verifica della documentazione).
Il software utilizzato per questa tesi, permette di redigere un piano di gestione ed autocontrollo aziendale, basato proprio sui dettami dell’HACCP ma il tutto a portata di un click. Nel caso specifico, lo abbiamo utilizzato per un’azienda londinese, la Niche free-from kitchen, che opera nel settore del catering aereo. Dopo una prima analisi, abbiamo riscontrato che il software, semplifica le operazioni di gestione: difatti la visione d’insieme delle produzioni aiuta l’operatore a tenere sotto controllo in tempo reale eventuali non conformità per una risposta immediata; la dematerializzazione dei documenti porta benefici in termini di precisione del lavoro, risparmio economico e riduzione di ingombro volumetrico in ufficio nonché un impatto ambientale inferiore; per ultimo, ma non meno importante, essendo la gestione totalmente digitalizzata, è senz'altro d’aiuto in un momento come quello che stiamo vivendo, in cui lo smart working ha assunto un’importanza fondamentale.
My thesis its foundations on technological innovation, which is described as the set of activities that businesses and institutions adopt at the end of new products and services, to make them available and usable to consumers. Technological innovation has influenced and conditioned the various eras, in fact, in 1784, with the first industrial revolution, we witnessed the invention of the frame and the steam engine, and then went on to 1890 where the electrical invention was certainly one of the most important discoveries, until 1970 in which he witnessed the upper hand of automation and therefore the construction of the first computers. We come then to the early 2000s, where on the occasion of the Hannover fair, to describe the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, the term ""industry 4.0"" was coined, to highlight the transition from a system based on physical interactions between man and machine to one in which the interaction between the data and the machines carry out most of the production operations. In the food sector, both research and technological innovations have been conducted not only by research entities and universities but also by start-ups, in order to obtain technological improvements and unknown products.
The term start-up (from English ""start""), indicates an intervention by a new company with all that is necessary both from a structural and organizational point of view and this elaborate, in fact, is based on the use of the SCM software (Safeaty Content Management), born from the Spin-Off of the University of Pisa, and applied to an air catering service in order to integrate itself into the management of the phases that carried out the same highlighting its advantages and potential.
The main mission of the software is to help food companies to draw up a self-control plan based on the HACCP principle, without running into errors or forgetfulness, all just a click away. The HACCP system is at the base of the food safety pyramid, but before that we meet regulation 178/02 and the hygiene package. Regulation 178/02, constitutes the primary source of modern European food law and contains in a single text the rights and duties of all operators in the food sector, therefore both those attributed to the FBOs and those designated to the Competent Authorities that carry out the controls in the field. It also establishes the general principles and requirements of food law, marking the transition from a multitude of national regulations, in implementation of the EU directives to a rational set of common rules verbatim applied in the entire Single Market. With the advent of this legislation, then, primary responsibility for achieving the objectives has been attributed to operators in the food sector; the task of verification, however, to the supervisory authorities. Then comes the hygiene package, a set of four legislative texts, published for the first time in 2004 but which entered into force on 1st January 2006, and named: Regulation 852/04, Regulation 853/04, Regulation 854/04 and regulation 882/04 (the last two regulations have been repealed and replaced by regulation 625/2017).
The first two regulations are addressed to the responsibilities that the FBOs must comply with in order to achieve the safety objectives; the latter, however, are intended for supervisory authorities. Thus we come to HACCP, an acronym for ""Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points"", or ""Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points"" which constitutes a valid system, organized and rational as well as shared at European level, for the application of the self-control of operators operating in the industries that treat, manipulate or distribute food.
The application of the HACCP system arises precisely from the need to guarantee the healthiness of food production by changing the approach, that is, passing from a control downstream of the production process, which existed in the past and carried out the control on the finished product, to a control of the production process at each stage, therefore identifying all the risks that can affect the safety of food and implementing all the preventive measures necessary to keep them under control. So, from a traditional product control, we have passed to a process control, that is the modern control. In Italy it was introduced in 1997, by Legislative Decree 155 of 1997. It is currently in force since it is covered by EC Regulation 852 of 2004, which repealed the previous Legislative Decree 155 of 1997. The development of the HACCP method requires that the so-called ""prerequisite programs"" or PRPs, that is the basic conditions and activities necessary to maintain an environment in a suitable condition for the preparation of healthy and safe products for human consumption, must be implemented and respected.
The effectiveness of this method, however, is only fully completed with compliance with 5 preliminary phases (establishment of the HACCP team, description of the product, description of possible uses, creation of a flowchart, field verification) and 7 principles ( hazard analysis, identification of CCPs, definition of critical limits, definition of monitoring, identification of corrective actions, verification of the effectiveness of the system and verification of documentation).
The software used for this thesis allows you to draw up a business management and self-control plan, based precisely on the dictates of HACCP but all within a click. In the specific case, we used it for a London-based company, the Niche free-from kitchen, which operates in the airline catering sector.
After a first analysis, we found that the software simplifies management operations: in fact, the overall view of the productions helps the operator to monitor any non-compliance in real time for an immediate response; the dematerialisation of documents brings benefits in terms of precision of work, economic savings and reduction of volumetric dimensions in the office as well as a lower environmental impact; last, but not least, being fully digitalized management, it is certainly helpful at a time like the one we are experiencing, in which smart working has taken on a fundamental importance",industry,858,not included

This leads to a narrowing of the possibility of their use in real gaming systems.  The object of research is the processes of creating and training game agents based on the evolutionary approaches of artificial intelligence. The purpose of the work is the development and justification of a formal model of a game agent based on machine learning methods, software implementation of the game process using neural networks and evolutionary optimization methods for multiple generations of game agent populations. To achieve this goal, the theoretical base, the existing research and development in the industry; a game scenario was designed, the main agents were identified, their main capabilities and expected behavior; training of game agents by various types of neural networks; development testing, quality assessment of behavior and decision-making by artificial intelligence using neural networks were performed; a comparative analysis of various types of neural networks, the proposed recommendations for their use for given conditions. To display the artificial neural network, the template components of the layer, neuron, and bridge were used. The created software module will allow game agents built using various neural networks to compete with each other (and not with a person, as in the normal game mode), and will reveal more prepared ones.  The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that a model of a game agent is formalized, based on machine learning methods. The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of video games built on the basis of artificial intelligence of game agents based on machine learning methods, as well as in other scientific studies.Методы машинного интеллекта с обучением вносят свою специфику к созданию и наладке игровой системы.Одна из главных проблем — это необходимость предвидения всего набора входных ситуаций и возможных ответов на моменте проектирования и невозможность расширения их списка без переобучения.

,to_check,core,,01/01/2019 00:00,core,cool dh,Report on improved use of individual metering concept,"In a low temperature district heating (LTDH) system the importance of well performing network and customer installations are essential due to reduced operation margins. The use of low-value waste heat in the production sets limitations on the supply temperature. New piping materials sets limitations on the supply temperature and the pressure level. All in all, this means an increased focus on ensuring that DH installations arewell performing. This report is about ‘individual metering concepts’. The LTDH-system is monitored by direct connection to the heat meters at all the consumers. The data from the heat meters can be used as a basis for describing, predicting and analysing the system's performance for better control of production and operation, for better conditions for troubleshooting and maintenance of the grid and the customer installations as well as for better customer service. The aim of this report is to:  give an overview over the current regulations for metering and billing of heat in Sweden and Denmark give an overview of desirable functionalities for DH meters and metering systems to provide input to applications that can be developed with the help of meter readings and which can be useful for the district heating industry describe how DH meter readings can be used for condition monitoring of service pipes and develop a method for this Regulations for metering and billing of DH follows EU regulations which says that all DH customers must be charged according to actual consumption. The overview of the current regulations for metering and billing in Denmark and Sweden shows that the two neighbouring countries have somewhat different approach to the individual metering concept. In Denmark there is a long tradition of individual metering in multifamily buildings and the tenants heat consumption is measured. In Sweden there is no such tradition and the individual metering concept generally is not in focus. Instead, the property owner is the customer. Denmark follows the Energy Efficiency Directive from 2012 (supplemented 2018) that requires individual metering and charging. The Swedish regulations on metering and billing are based on the exception in the EU regulation concerning individual metering and charging saying that individual metering must be economically justifiable. The Swedish National Board of Housing has shown that implementation of the EU regulations is not economically justifiable for the Swedish case ‐ neither for existing buildings or in new buildings. There is a general attitude that increased frequency and higher resolution of meter readings automatically results in increased possibilities for new and improved analyses of customer performance. At present there are several researchers and research groups that are using meter readings from DH customers and machine learning with the aim to improve the energy performance of both the DH customer installations as well as the DH network and production operation. From ongoing projects four areas for applications have been identified: Fault detection, Load prediction, Production planning and Operational optimization. For these applications hourly meter readings are sufficient, at least in combination with historical data and weather conditions. For improved fault detection algorithms and moving towards fault diagnosis it would be beneficial to access secondary meter readings such as temperatures in the secondary side heating‐ and domestic hot water system as well as indoor temperatures. When moving on towards fault diagnosis, the frequency may also be in focus. A temporary shift to meter readings with higher frequency may be necessary for diagnosis. All in all, it might not be the frequency of the meter readings that should be increased, it might be more beneficial to include more meter parameters from the customer side of the heat exchanger. By integration of more meter parameters, the focus may shift from a matter of frequency to the broad concept of Internet of things (IoT). One scope within this project was to evaluate the feasibility for usage of meter readings from customer installations to detect increased heat losses in service pipes due to moisture. A theoretical study was carried out, but it did not turn into a success. Results showed that even though the heat losses in the service pipe increases due to moisture content, the impact on the measured parameters, that is temperature and flow, are low and would be hard to detect. A higher resolution or increased frequency of meter readings would not improve the feasibility to use meter readings for monitoring increased heat losses in service pipes since if feasible, it would require stable heat load at the customer installation and stable and known temperature conditions in the DH network. Through studies performed within this work and by other researchers it is clear that DH utilities, both in Denmark and Sweden, has a desire to improve customer performance and to reduce the DH return temperature. A key factor for success within this field is good customer relations and access to the customer’s DH substation. This may be a driving force for DH‐utilities to offer service agreement and ICT‐platforms for greater customer engagement. Customers seems to be more willing to take actions to improve their installations if they understand why it is important. Recommendations: The following recommendations are given based on the overall picture provided by the report's different compilations and studies:  The meter should be able to measure the energy for every hour and be able to convert to measure with higher frequencies (minutes). Some types of measurement data analyses may require a higher resolution than hourly measurement, which is why the possibility of higher resolution should be provided, without that being a default setting.  It should be possible to remotely upgrading the meters and to remotely change the meter frequency. This will provide that new functionalities can be introduced in a cost‐efficient way and that expensive field visits can be avoided.  Access to secondary meter readings. The following measurements were seen as the most important: Indoor temperatures, secondary temperatures measured on branches for the heating system in the building, and measurement on the district heating differential pressure. Measuring these parameters would be beneficial for developing algorithms for fault detection and for improving system performance for the total district heating system, as well as for as being able to guarantee the quality of energy supplies at the customer substations.  There should be a digital interface that the end customers can use to access their energy consumption locally. The communication solution should also support a future standard for communication with devices in the home. In order to be of real use for the customers, this should be delivered with some kind of analysis tools that can help the customers relate their consumption or data to reference data (for example historical data, norms or set point values) and that can provide the customer with extended analysis that make sense to the customer",industry,861,not included

This leads to a significant complication of the cyber threat landscape, an increase in the number of cyberattacks with a significant increase in the negative financial and non-financial consequences that cyberattacks have on the banking system and the economy as a whole. The author, based on the generalization of research on this topic, clarified the content of the concept of ""cyber resilience of a bank"". Its essential characteristics were determined in the context of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The article studies theoretical approaches to ensuring the cyber resilience of banks, which made it possible to develop a conceptual model of the mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience, adequate to the current state and conditions in which the banks of Ukraine operate. The developed mechanism for ensuring cyber resilience allows for: 1) the formalization of the landscape of real and potential cyber threats; 2) ensures the consistency of mechanisms and tools for countering them, adapting and/or recovering from cyber incidents; 3) allows not only to adequately respond to existing cyber threats but also to identify negative factors that can lead to the emergence and implementation of new cyber threats and cyber-attacks. According to the results of the study, it was found that the effective functioning of the mechanism for ensuring the cyber resilience of the bank requires appropriate organizational support. For this, the author substantiated the need to create a Bank Cyber Resilience Center. It should include representatives from the departments responsible for banking business continuity, cybersecurity, cyber risk management and IT quality. This will allow obtaining a synergistic effect by creating a single interconnected process-based model, including metrics of the bank's cyber resilience level and KPIs, as well as tools for monitoring, controlling and resisting external and internal cyber threats, adaptation and/or recovery after them",industry,862,not included

Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions.

From coding to computational thinking through computational mathematics problem based learning (CM-PBL),"4th Industrial revolution are spreading around the world, embedding the technology into societies. In the digital revolution, high technological tools and resources are regularly being developed. There has been increased attention on learning coding in education field, in order to nurture sufficient number of young generation to fill in 50 percent of jobs opportunity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which are computing-related. It is increasingly clear that our new generation need to think critically to solve the ill-structured problems, uncertain and complex real world problems. Computational thinking is beneficial in providing automated or semi-automated solutions in problems solving in combination with critical thinking. Therefore, computational thinking is becoming an important implication in science and mathematics as well as in almost every other fields. This fact is reflected in the recent implementation of computer coding in the Malaysia’s school curriculum to nurture 21st century skills among students. Computational thinking is one of the conceptual foundations which required combination of data and ideas to solve problems effectively and efficiently. Computational thinking is essential to computing and information science (i.e., algorithmically, with or without the assistance of computers) to solve problems with solutions that are reusable in different contexts. Promoting different kind of skills and abilities among students is important to solve the complexity problem in real world. Thus, it is a challenging task for many instructors to create a learning environment who lack of feasible resources availability and research-based information to redesign their teaching pedagogies. This conceptual framework is aimed at two goals: (1) development of deep learning, connected computational thinking through the mathematical curriculum instructional model which able to enhance students’ problem solving abilities and (2) implementation of the designed model to assist teacher in education who has practicing difficulty in elementary classrooms after adopting teacher enactment of problem-based curriculum resources. To achieve these goals, computational mathematics problem based learning (CM-PBL) instructional strategy is developed to promote an active learning environment for classroom management involving problem solving. Rather than emphasizing student learning passively through listening, watching, practicing exercises and imitating isolated skills, the CM-PBL learning framework allowing students to simulate and build their own computational models to support their self-learning and understanding of mathematic concepts. It is also highlights ways that students can evolve from technical skills in using technology to soft engineering skills by using coding knowledge",industry,864,not included

We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge. As proven by previous hardware emulation tools, there is also a potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine early in the development cycle. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by predictive software running on a desktop computer. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL Safety Critical API. First, we create nonparametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames per second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated.

,to_check,core,,09/08/2018 00:00,core,university of southern california. libraries,Managing functional coupling sequences to reduce complexity and increase modularity in conceptual design,"2018-08-10According to the Axiomatic Design Theory (ADT), a design concept that can satisfy the upstream objectives under downstream constraints with the minimal relative complexity can lead to the most ideal design. As stated by Suh’s Complexity Theory, the relative complexity of a design concept is caused by couplings between functional requirements (FRs) and design parameters (DPs), and can be reduced by strategically ordering the execution (i.e., implementation) sequence of DPs. However, it is generally very difficult in the current design practice to obtain this “execution sequence” with existing methods due to their inherent limitations and/or many real-world restrictions. Meanwhile, many practical methods, such as the modular design approach, have been widely used in industries to produce real-world design results that don’t necessarily conform with the principles required by those ideal design theories. As a result, from the perspectives of design theories, most real-world designs are “not ideal” (i.e., having some relative complexities due to FR-DP couplings) and therefore can (and should) be improved by better sequencing their DPs. This is the motivation under which the Design Coupling Sequence (DCS) method was developed in this thesis research. The DCS method can assist designers to automatically obtain the “execution sequences,” in the forms of functional sets, that can yield the minimal relative complexity, hence making a practical design concept most ideal (i.e., as close to the ideal concept with the minimal relative complexity as possible) while taking into practical considerations (such as increasing the modularity to lower the production costs) in real-world conceptual designs. ❧ The DCS method defines the ‘precedence’ between ‘functional sets’ to manage coupled design concepts to support the modular approach during conceptual design. It identifies the ‘precedence’ by the level of functional coupling to determine the proper sequencing order to minimize the overall complexity. Two types of functional sets are defined in DCS as 1) the complete independently set U: the collection of all the functionally dependent DPs in the system so that the set is independent to other U sets, and 2) the indivisible coupled set C: the collection of coupled concepts that can’t be decoupled by sequencing, so it prescribes the designer to consider the group of DPs together as a set to match existing modules in the database. To handle the real complexity of design concepts which require redesign, the DCS algorithm helps to determine the proper execution sequence. To minimize the imaginary complexity, which occurs when design concepts “appear” to be functionally coupled due to a lack of understanding of the system structure, the DCS method provides a formula to reveal the number of acceptable execution sequences that can lead to the simplest design implementation. Compared with existing methods, the DCS method is applicable for any design cases with known design matrices, including the square, rectangular, zero-at-diagonal, large, and/or numerical matrices. In short, for all practical design cases, DCS can organize functional-coupled design concepts as “functional sets” with execution sequences of DPs that lead to the minimal complexity of this design concept. ❧ The foundation, hypothesis, algorithm and its usability of the DCS method are validated by four case studies in this research. The faucet design case demonstrates how to apply the DCS method and shows the differences between ADT and DCS results. The case of coffee maker design shows how the DCS method manages the functional sets based on the design matrices reengineered from existing design concepts. The vehicle tire design case demonstrates how different DCS strategies within the Innovative Design Thinking (IDT framework during the conceptual design stage can work in a real-world product development situation. The IDT framework prescribes four consecutive steps: (1) following the top-down process to ideate new design concepts that satisfy the principles/axioms suggested by the design theory to reach a certain layer of details, (2) following the bottom-up process to identify some existing design modules from available engineering database (or catalogs) that can satisfy the functional requirements at this detail layer, (3) constructing the design matrix that shows the couplings between FRs and DPs at this detail layer, and (4) apply the DCS algorithm to determine the execution sequence of DPs based on the above design matrix. This will yield a new design concept with an execution sequence that is most creative (because it satisfies the design principles at the top layers) and most practical (because it utilizes the existing modules at the bottom layers). Finally, a case of collision avoidance planning presents one of the possible extensions of the DCS algorithm. ❧ The results of this research have significant impacts on both design theory and design practice. Theoretically, the approach in this research 1) guides designers to improve concepts not only organizing design matrix but also extract additional coupling information to increase modularity and 2) is a more generalized approach than the previous methods that can be applied to any design cases with design matrix. Practically, the research 1) demonstrates the usability of the DCS algorithm within an executive program to generate the DCS functional sets automatically for large design system and 2) allows the principle of functional dependency and the practice of modular design to be considered simultaneously as much as possible during the conceptual design stage. It is a fundamental contribution that demonstrates how the ideal principles (or axioms) of design theories can be used together strategically with practical design methods (or considerations) in industry practices to generate real-world design results that are both most practical and creative. For future research, there would be three aspects- DCS algorithm, DCS sets, and DCS strategies. Number one, DCS algorithm would be further revised to extend to software design or machine learning with functional sets in terms of a component diagram. Number two, with DCS sets, the three-dimensional design matrix could be studied further. Number three, DCS strategies would be investigated further for applying on detailed design cases. ❧ As a recap, the research prescribes a functional coupling managing algorithm with functional sets for suggesting acceptable execution sequences in conceptual design. It not only helps designers with complexity reduction but also bridges the ideal design theory to practical modules. The designer can create better designs that are most creative and yet practical by using the DCS strategies",industry,869,not included

A aquisição dos dados utilizados na construção dos sensores virtuais foi realizada através do modelo matemático do processo, simulado com dados reais de uma planta industrial. O estudo específico engloba a modelagem matemática/termodinâmica e avaliação do comportamento estacionário e dinâmico dessa torre, simulada aqui no software Aspen Plus e DynamicsTM. Desse modo, o modelo fornece os dados necessários para inferência das impurezas relacionadas, que são os teores dos compostos tetracloreto de carbono (CCl4) e clorofórmio (CHCl3), ambos devem ser mantidos, respectivamente, em valores ≤3000 e ≤400 ppm (partes por

Thus, the model provides the necessary data to infer the contents of the carbon impurities mentioned above, Tetrachloride (CCl4) and Chloroform (CHCl3), which are to be fixed approximately below 3000 and 400 ppm (parts per million) respectively. The methodology also covers selection algorithms of secondary variables, using multivariate statistical techniques: All Possible Regressions (TRP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data generated was checked in order to know whether to include or not a step for removal of outliers, so it was also included in the methodology one preprocessing data step. The ten best inference models

were selected for each output concentration. With this information, these models do not use concentrations measurements in the feed streams but measurements of the temperature along the column. This is an important conclusion from the point of view of virtual sensors building, because in most of the literature reported these variables are crucial in getting good results. The training of soft sensors was done in a noisy environment, considering that simulated noise was inherent to measurements (Gaussian noise). In the final step, the soft sensors devices are constructed using an empirical modeling technique of artificial neural networks (ANN), which were generated ANN type Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Several variations were also evaluated on the number of neurons and hidden layers of networks, employing as a stopping criterion the

cross-validation technique. The developed soft sensors presented satisfactory errors from the engineering viewpoint, a good regression and a good mean square error. Finally, with these estimations it is expected to minimize and predict the transient behavior of the compounds in the referred process",industry,871,not included

The final version is available from ASME via the DOI in this recordOffshore wind assets have reached multi-GW scale and additional
capacity is being installed and developed. To achieve demanding
cost of energy targets, awarded by competitive auctions,
the operation and maintenance (O&M) of these assets has to become
increasingly efficient, whilst ensuring compliance and effectiveness.
Existing offshore wind farm assets generate a significant
amount of inhomogeneous data related to O&M processes.
These data contain rich information about the condition of the
assets, which is rarely fully utilized by the operators and service
providers. Academic and industrial research and development
efforts have led to a suite of tools trying to apply sensor data
and build machine learning models to diagnose, trend and predict
component failures. This study presents a decision support
framework incorporating a range of different supervised and unsupervised
learning algorithms. The aim is to provide guidance
for asset owners on how to select the most relevant datasets, apply
and choose the different machine learning algorithms and
how to integrate the data stream with daily maintenance procedures.
The presented methodology is tested on a real case example
of an offshore wind turbine gearbox replacement at Teesside
offshore wind farm. The study uses kNN and SVM algorithms to
detect the fault using SCADA data and an autoregressive model
for the CMS data. The implementation of all the algorithms has
resulting in an accuracy higher than 94%. The results of this
paper will be of interest to offshore wind farm developers and operators to streamline and optimize their O&M planning activities

Extruder calibration <a id=""extcal""></a>
To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly.
Calibration set-up <a id=""calset""></a>
In principle, the calibration set-up requires:

CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor)
the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts)
a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable)

The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement.
Calibration procedure <a id=""calpro""></a>

adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values)
command piston movement for an exact distance
measure the real movement distance and compare
repeat steps 1-3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value

For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M5 spindle (0.5mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914.30.
Thermistor calibration <a id=""thermcal""></a>
Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section.
EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass.

pour a small glass of oil (50mL or so)
place the glass on the heat source
fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer
sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil
prepare the system to read analog values 
turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1°C increment
plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature)
fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others)
software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega)

Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values.

,to_check,core,,01/01/2017 00:00,core,bayesian modeling for optimization and control in robotics,,"Robotics has the potential to be one of the most revolutionary technologies in human history. The impact of cheap and
potentially limitless manpower could have a profound influence on our everyday life and overall onto our society. As
envisioned by Iain M. Banks, Asimov and many other science fictions writers, the effects of robotics on our society might
lead to the disappearance of physical labor and a generalized increase of the quality of life. However, the large-scale
deployment of robots in our society is still far from reality, except perhaps in a few niche markets such as manufacturing.
One reason for this limited deployment of robots is that, despite the tremendous advances in the capabilities of the
robotic hardware, a similar advance on the control software is still lacking. The use of robots in our everyday life is still
hindered by the necessary complexity to manually design and tune the controllers used to execute tasks. As a result,
the deployment of robots often requires lengthy and extensive validations based on human expert knowledge, which
limit their adaptation capabilities and their widespread diffusion. In the future, in order to truly achieve an ubiquitous
robotization of our society, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of deploying new robots in new environments and
tasks.
The goal of this dissertation is to provide automatic tools based on Machine Learning techniques to simplify and
streamline the design of controllers for new tasks. In particular, we here argue that Bayesian modeling is an important tool
for automatically learning models from raw data and properly capture the uncertainty of the such models. Automatically
learning models however requires the definition of appropriate features used as input for the model. Hence, we present
an approach that extend traditional Gaussian process models by jointly learning an appropriate feature representation
and the subsequent model. By doing so, we can strongly guide the features representation to be useful for the subsequent
prediction task.
A first robotics application where the use of Bayesian modeling is beneficial is the accurate learning of complex dynamics models. For highly non-linear robotic systems, such as in presence of contacts, the use of analytical system
identification techniques can be challenging and time-consuming, or even intractable. We introduce a new approach for
learning inverse dynamics models exploiting artificial tactile sensors. This approach allows to recognize and compensate
for the presence of unknown contacts, without requiring a spatial calibration of the tactile sensors. We demonstrate
on the humanoid robot iCub that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art analytical models, and when employed in
control tasks significantly improves the tracking accuracy.
A second robotics application of Bayesian modeling is automatic black-box optimization of the parameters of a controller. When the dynamics of a system cannot be modeled (either out of complexity or due to the lack of a full state
representation), it is still possible to solve a task by adapting an existing controller. The approach used in this thesis is
Bayesian optimization, which allows to automatically optimize the parameters of the controller for a specific task. We
evaluate and compare the performance of Bayesian optimization on a gait optimization task on the dynamic bipedal
walker Fox. Our experiments highlight the benefit of this approach by reducing the parameters tuning time from weeks
to a single day.
In many robotic application, it is however not possible to always define a single straightforward desired objective.
More often, multiple conflicting objectives are desirable at the same time, and thus the designer needs to take a decision
about the desired trade-off between such objectives (e.g., velocity vs. energy consumption). One framework that is
useful to assist in this decision making is the multi-objective optimization framework, and in particular the definition of
Pareto optimality. We propose a novel framework that leverages the use of Bayesian modeling to improve the quality
of traditional multi-objective optimization approaches, even in low-data regimes. By removing the misleading effects
of stochastic noise, the designer is presented with an accurate and continuous Pareto front from which to choose the
desired trade-off. Additionally, our framework allows the seamless introduction of multiple robustness metrics which can
be considered during the design phase. These contributions allow an unprecedented support to the design process of
complex robotic systems in presence of multiple objective, and in particular with regards to robustness.
The overall work in this thesis successfully demonstrates on real robots that the complexity of deploying robots to solve
new tasks can be greatly reduced trough automatic learning techniques. We believe this is a first step towards a future
where robots can be used outside of closely supervised environments, and where a newly deployed robot could quickly
and automatically adapt to accomplish the desired tasks",industry,875,included

No caso da geometria dos cordões de solda no processo GMAW, diferentes pesquisas têm sido encaminhadas ao controle dos parâmetros operacionais que garantam as características geométricas requeridas, entre as mais importantes, a largura, o reforço e a penetração. Atualmente, diferentes modelos baseados em modelamento empírico ou em inteligência artificial são utilizados para controlar um parâmetro geométrico à vez. Este trabalho propõe uma estratégia que, independente de modelos predefinidos do processo, permite controlar simultaneamente a largura e o reforço dos cordões de solda no processo de soldagem GMAW no modo de transferência metálica por curto-circuito (GMAW-S). O controlador proposto é baseado em agentes inteligentes focados diretamente nas medições de largura e reforço dos cordões de solda. O monitoramento dos parâmetros geométricos é realizado em tempo real utilizando uma única câmera e diferentes metodologias de processamento digital de imagens. A avaliação da estabilidade do processo é realizada em tempo real e emprega-se para sair das regiões de instabilidade nas quais possa incorrer o processo durante a etapa de controle. A metodologia de monitoramento é avaliada como satisfatória utilizando o teste “t” para diferentes combinações de parâmetros de entrada. O tempo de processamento de cada imagem não supera os 3 ms, considerando-se adequado visando etapas de controle com uma taxa de amostragem de 100 Hz. Os resultados experimentais mostram que a implementação da estratégia de controle proposta é viável e consegue atingir simultaneamente diferentes valores de referência de largura e reforço dos cordões de solda.The GMAW process is widely used in industry due to, among others, its easer automation and high productivity. In the case of weld bead geometry in GMAW processes, different researches have been conducted to control operating parameters and to ensure required geometrical characteristics, among the most important: the width, the height and the penetration. Currently, different models, based on empirical modeling or artificial intelligence methodologies, are used to control individual geometric parameters. This work proposes a strategy that, regardless of predefined models, can simultaneously control the width and the height of the weld beads in GMAW-S process. The proposed control system is based on intelligent agents focus on measurements of the weld bead width and height. The geometric parameters monitoring is performed in real time using a single camera and different methods of digital image processing. The evaluation of process stability is performed in real time and employed to avoid the regions of instability in which may incur this process during the control stage. The monitoring methodology is assessed as satisfactory using the “t” test for different combinations of input parameters. The time of the image processing does not exceed 3 ms for each image and is considered appropriate to control steps, which use a 100 Hz sampling rate.

Of many common relevant research topics, virtual prototyping is currently one of the most important. In this paper, we describe our first complete version of a generic and modular software framework for intelligent computer-automated product design. We present our framework in the context of design of offshore cranes, with easy extensions to other products, be it maritime or not. Funded by the Research Council of Norway and its Programme for Regional R&D and Innovation (VRI), the work we present has been part of two separate but related research projects (grant nos. 241238 and 249171) in close cooperation with two local maritime industrial partners. We have implemented several software modules that together constitute the framework, of which the most important are a server-side crane prototyping tool (CPT), a client-side web graphical user interface (GUI), and a client-side artificial intelligence for product optimisation (AIPO) module that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) library for optimising design parameters to achieve a crane design with desired performance. Communication between clients and server is achieved by means of the HTTP and WebSocket protocols and JSON as the data format. To demonstrate the feasibility of the fully functioning complete system, we present a case study where our computer-automated design was able to improve the existing design of a real and delivered 50-tonnes, 2.9 million EUR knuckleboom crane with respect to some chosen desired design criteria. Our framework being generic and modular, both clientside and server-side modules can easily be extended or replaced. We demonstrate the feasibility of this concept in an accompanying paper submitted concurrently, in which we create a simple product optimisation client in Matlab that uses readily available toolboxes to connect to the CPT and optimise various crane designs by means of a GA. In addition, our research team is currently developing a winch prototyping tool to which our existing AIPO module can connect and optimise winch designs with only small configuration changes.

Laser milling is a relatively new micro-manufacturing technique in the production of high-value industrial components. The industrial problem is defined by a data set relayed through standard sensors situated on a laser-milling centre, which is a machine tool for manufacturing high-value micro-moulds, micro-dies and micro-tools. The new three-phase industrial system presented in this study is capable of identifying a model for the laser-milling process based on low-order models. The first two steps are based on the use of unsupervized connectionist models. The first step involves the analysis of the data sets that define each case study to identify if they are informative enough or if the experiments have to be performed again. In the second step, a feature selection phase is performed to determine the main variables to be processed in the third step. In this last step, the results of the study provide a model for a laser-milling procedure based on low-order models, such as black-box, in order to approximate the optimal form of the laser-milling process. The three-step model has been tested with real data obtained for three different materials: aluminium, cooper and hardened steel. These three materials are used in the manufacture of micro-moulds, micro-coolers and micro-dies, high-value tools for the medical and automotive industries among others. As the model inputs are standard data provided by the laser-milling centre, the industrial implementation of the model is immediate.

Papers were selected on the basis of fundamental ideas and concepts rather than the direct usage of well-established techniques. This special issue is then aimed at practitioners, researchers and post-graduate students, who are engaged in developing and applying advanced Soft Computing Models to solving real-world problems in the Industrial and Environmental fields. The papers are organized as follows. In the first contribution, Graña and Gonzalez-Acuña develop a formulation of dendritic classifiers based on lattice kernels and train them using a direct Monte Carlo approach and a Sparse Bayesian Learning. The results of both kinds of training are compared with the Relevance Vector Machines on a collection of benchmark datasets. In the second contribution by Irigoyen and Miñano, the authors present the results of the identification of the relationship in time, between the required exercise (machine resistance) and the heart rate of the patient in medical effort tests, using a NARX neural network model. In the experimental stage, test data have been obtained by exercising with a cyclo-ergometer in two different tests: Power Step Response and Conconi. Carneiro et al. in the third contribution present a biologically inspired method to deal with the problem in which genetic algorithms are used to create possible solutions for a given dispute. The approach presented is able to generate a broad number of diverse solutions that cover virtually the whole search space for a given problem. The results of this work are being applied in a negotiation tool that is part of the UMCourt conflict resolution platform. In the fourth contribution by Donate et al., they propose a novel Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) approach, where a weighted n-fold validation fitness scheme is used to build an ensemble of neural networks, under four different combination methods: mean, median, softmax and rank-based combinations. Several experiments were held, using six real-world time series with different characteristics and from distinct domains. Overall, the proposed approach achieved competitive results when compared with non weighted n-fold EANN ensembles, the simpler 0-fold EANN and also the popular Holt–Winters statistical method. Dan Burdescu et al. in the fifth contribution, present a system used in the medical domain for three distinct tasks: image annotation, semantic based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. An original image segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure was used to perform the segmentation of medical images. Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The annotation and semantic based retrieval task is evaluated for two annotation models: Cross Media Relevance Model and Continuous-space Relevance Model. Semantic based image retrieval is performed using the methods provided by the annotation models. The ontology used by the annotation process was created in an original manner starting from the information content provided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The experiments were made using a database containing colour images retrieved from medical domain using an endoscope and related to digestive diseases. In sixth paper by Pedraza et al., they develop a face recognition system based on soft computing techniques, which complies with privacy-by-design rules and defines a set of principles that context-aware applications (including biometric sensors) should contain to conform to European and US law. This research deals with the necessity to consider legal issues concerning privacy or human rights in the development of biometric identification in ambient intelligence systems. Clearly, context-based services and ambient intelligence (and the most promising research area in Europe, namely ambient assisted living, ALL) call for a major research effort on new identification procedures. The aim of the research by Redel-Macías et al. in paper seven is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem. In the eighth paper, Wu et al. analyse the existence criterion of loop strategies, and then present some corollaries and theorems, by which the loop strategies and chain strategies can be found, also superfluous strategies and inconsistent strategies. It presents a ranking model that indicates the weak node in strategy set and it also introduces a probability-based model which is the basis of evaluation of strategy. Additionally, this research proposes a method to generate offensive strategy, and the statistic results of simulation game prove the validity of the method. Pop et al. in the ninth paper present an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a local–global approach to the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) and a powerful local search procedure. The computational experiments on several benchmarks instances show that the hybrid algorithm is competitive to all of the known heuristics published to date. In the tenth paper Kramer et al. illustrate how methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting, and monitoring techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable, and smart energy grids. The study is based on the application of kernel methods like support vector regression and kernel density estimation as prediction methods. Furthermore, dimension reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of high-dimensional wind time series are applied. The methods are briefly introduced, related work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The experimental parts are based on real wind energy time series data from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Vera et al. in the eleventh contribution present a novel soft computing procedure based on the application of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and identification systems, which makes it possible to optimise the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving both time and financial costs and/or energy. The novel proposed approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. The final contribution, by Sakalauskas and Kriksciuniene, presents a research about financial market efficiency and to recognize major reversal points of long-term trend of stock market index, which could indicate forthcoming crisis or market raise periods. The study suggests a computational model of financial time series analysis, which combines several approaches of soft computing, including information efficiency evaluation methods (Shannon's entropy, Hurst exponent), neural networks and sensitivity analysis. The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behaviour, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index. The performance of neural network model is explored by applying sensitivity analysis and resulted in selecting smoothing parameters of the input variables. The experimental research investigates behaviour of the long-term trend of the three emerging financial markets within NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchange. Introduction of information efficiency measures improve ability of the model to recognize the approaching reversal of long-term trend from temporary market “nervousness” and can be useful for calibrating stock trading strategy.

In early stages of graphics processing, such tasks were delegated to a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Over time as more complex graphics rendering was demanded, CPU solutions became inadequate. To meet this demand, custom hardware solutions that take advantage of pipelining and massive parallelism become more preferable to CPU software based solutions. This fact has lead to the many custom hardware solutions that are available today. Since real time graphics processing requires extreme high performance, hardware solutions using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the standard within the industry. While ASICs are a more than adequate solution for implementing high performance custom hardware, the design, implementation and testing of ASIC based designs are becoming cost prohibitive due to the massive up front verification effort needed as well as the cost of fixing design defects.Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide an alternative to the ASIC design flow. More importantly, in recent years FPGA technology have begun to improve in performance to the point where ASIC and FPGA performance has become comparable. In addition, FPGAs address many of the issues of the ASIC design flow. The ability to reconfigure FPGAs reduces the upfront verification effort and allows design defects to be fixed easily. This thesis demonstrates that a 3-D graphics processor implementation on and FPGA is feasible by implementing both a two dimensional and three dimensional graphics processor prototype. By using a Xilinx Virtex 5 ML506 FPGA development kit a fully functional wireframe graphics rendering engine is implemented using VHDL and Xilinx's development tools. A VHDL testbench was designed to verify that the graphics engine works functionally. This is followed by synthesizing the design and real hardware and developing test applications to verify functionality and performance of the design.

The opportunities of an effective use of these new data sources are enormous, however, the huge size and dimensionality of current large databases call for new ideas to scale up current statistical and computational approaches. This paper presents an application of Artificial Intelligence technology to the problem of automatic detection of candidate anomalous records in a large database. We build our approach with three main goals in mind: 1)An effective detection of the records that are potentially anomalous, 2)A suitable selection of the subset of attributes that explains what makes a record anomalous, and 3)An efficient implementation that allows us to scale the approach to large databases. Our algorithm, called Bayesian Network Anomaly Detector (BNAD), uses 2 the joint probability density function (pdf) provided by a Bayesian Network (BN) to achieve these goals. By using appropriate data structures, advanced caching techniques, the flexibility of Gaussian Mixture models, and the efficiency of BNs to model joint pdfs, BNAD manages to efficiently learn a suitable BN from a large dataset.

Algoritmos baseados em redes neurais tem demonstrado ser altamente acertivos, e quando empregados em conjunto a sistemas modelados em lógica fuzzy incorporam ao banco de dados subjetividade e experiências adquiridas ao longo do tempo, dotando o programa de capacidade de reagir de forma mais adequada frente a diferentes condições de processo e situações inesperadas. No processo de lingotamento contínuo é realizada a solidificação do aço na forma de placas, as quais serão enviadas para processamentos posteriores, exigindo que sua aparência superficial seja livre de irregularidades. Elevados requisitos de qualidade visam garantir maior produtividade, estabilidade operacional e acabamento superficial das bobinas laminadas. O primeiro estágio da solidificação do aço se inicia no molde onde o aço líquido, em contato com as faces do molde, forma uma casca externa solidificada. Um dos fenômenos mais prejudiciais à produção e manutenção da regularidade superficial da placa é o colamento do aço na face cobreada do molde, que leva a ruptura da pele de aço em formação. O “rompimento de pele” como é denominado, gera parada imediata e emergencial do lingotamento contínuo, bem como o sucatamento das placas em produção. De forma a se evitar a ocorrência de rompimentos de pele, os moldes de cobre possuem duas linhas de termopares instalados em suas faces para monitoramento em tempo real das condições de troca de calor durante o lingotamento. Um programa faz a comparação contínua da evolução do perfil de temperatura com os existentes em seu banco de dados, referentes a eventos de colamento de aço no molde. O programa Mold Sticker Detection (MSD) tem o objetivo de inibir a ocorrência de rompimentos de pele. Quando o MSD entende que em um determinado momento está ocorrendo o colamento de aço no molde, este gera um alarme reduzindo instantânemente a velocidade de lingotamento para valores de segurança. Essa redução abrupta tem por objetivo recompor a pele rompida, mas em contra partida causa marcas profundas na superfície da placa, além das geradas pelo próprio colamento. Este trabalho objetiva desenvolver um modelo baseado em lógica fuzzy a ser incorporado ao sistema atual de detecção de rompimento – MSD, procurando reduzir a geração de alarmes de colamento através da determinação da velocidade de lingotamento ideal condizentes com as condições atuais de extração de calor no molde. Para medição da eficácia do modelo proposto foram avaliadas as perdas de produtividade, bem como o número de ocorrência de alarmes de colamento e rompimentos de pele.A growing application of advanced programming concepts and artificial intelligence, has created a numerous and new usages for these algorithms in industrial processes resulting in expressive gains on productivity and resource savings. Algorithms based in neural networks has been proving its higher sharpness, and when applied together with fuzzy conceived systems may embody to the data basis subjectivity and experiences acquired through time, dowering the program of capacity to react more properly under different process conditions and uncommon situations. During the continuous casting process, the steel is solidified under a slab shape, which will be forward to post processes, demanding a smooth and roughness free surface appearance. Higher quality requirements aim to guarantee productivity increase, operational stability and greater superficial finishing of the laminated coils. The very first stage of steel solidification has its start on the mould where the liquid steel, facing the mould copper plates, forms an external solidified shell. One of the most harmful phenomena to the production regularity maintenance and superficial evenness of the slab is the steel sticking to the copper mould plates, which leads to the rupture of the solidifying shell. The shell break-out, as nominated, causes instant and emergency stoppage of the continuous casting machine and inproduction slabs scrapping. In order to avoid break-out occurrences, the mould has two thermocouple lines installed on the plates for real time monitoring of the heat transfer conditions during casting. A software compares the actual thermal profile with the existent data base concerning sticker events on the mould. The program Mold Sticker Detection (MSD) is used to inhibit break-outs. When the MSD understands that in a specific time a sticking is progress, it generates an alarm reducing instantaneously the casting speed to a safety value. This sudden reduction is provided to give enough time to have the steel shell rebuilt, but also marks deeply the slab surface besides those deriving from the sticking itself. This work has the objective to develop a fuzzy based model to be incorporated to the existing break-out detect system – MSD, aiming to reduce the occurrences of sticker alarms by establishing the ideal casting speed concerning the actual heat extraction conditions on the mould. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed model, will be evaluated the production losses, number of sticker alarms and break-outs as well",industry,885,not included

Fraud and abuse in medical claims have become a major concern within health insurance companies in Chile the last years due to the increasing losses in revenues. Processing medical claims is an exhausting manual task carried out by a few medical experts who have the responsibility of approving, modifying or rejecting the subsidies requested within a limited period from their reception. The proposed detection system uses one committee of multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) for each one of the entities involved in the fraud/abuse problem: medical claims, affiliates, medical professionals and employers. Results of the fraud detection system show a detection rate of approximately 75 fraudulent and abusive cases per month, making the detection 6.6 months earlier than without the system.

results of the interviews have shown that the main causes of productivity increase were
related to process, of which the most frequent were communication, collaboration and

The bacterium has as closest relatives M. chelonae, M. abscessus and collectively these bacteria form the M. chelonae complex. The early detection of M. immunogenum and other bacteria implicated in the causation of HP may be crucial to reducing its prevalence. As detection by conventional techniques such as cultured is severely limited, an M. immunogenum-specific quantitative real-time PCR system was developed (Rhodes et al., 2008).  This technique made use of a 5’ nuclease assay (Taqman) to detect fluorescence in real time upon specific amplification of target DNA. When initially validated laboratory strains and on industrial metal working fluids from the UK and USA from which no M. immunogenum CFU were recovered, the assay detected between 3.4 x101 and 1.9 x 104 cell equivalents (CE) per ml, and increased the detection rate over culture to 37.5% (12 of 32 samples; Rhodes et al., 2008).

Since it offers flexibility, it can be adapted to make estimations of any measurement, thus a reducing in operating costs without compromising the measurements, and in some cases even improve the quality of generated information. Since they are completely softwarebased, they are not subjected to physical damage as the real sensors, and are better adaptated to harsh environments with hard access.

Its industrial importance was one of the motivations for this thesis. On-line measurement and monitoring of cultivations of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14945 in a agitated and aerated bioreactor allowed the acquisition of variables such as mol fraction of CO2 and O2 in the exhaust
gases, pH, dissolved oxygen. Batch and fed-batch runs, using either enzymatically hydrolyzed casein or a pool of free amino acids provided information concerning the extend of the cultivation, preservation of the microorganism and addition/exclusion of nutrients. Usual carbon
sources as glucose, fructose and glycerol increased the cellular mass, but did not improve the productivity of PGA. The use of amino acids resulted in a 2.5-fold increase of productivity. Adding phenyl acetic acid at the beginning of the experiments did not inhibit cell growth.
Three non-structured models of microbial growth were put forth, assuming one, two and three limiting substrates. However, these models were too simple for our purposes. Another approach was then followed, using neural networks (NN) as
softsensors. Before implementing the inference algorithm, the blank noise of the instrumentation had to be reduced. A non-conventional filter was developed, combining
a recursive NN, a moving average and a second recursive NN. The smoothed variables were the input for a second NN, for pattern recognition, which classified the run in one of the main growth phases: lag, exponential and stationary. The main purpose of this NN was to identify the exponential phase, which would be the domain of the next NN, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for inference of the cellular mass. Several NN, with
different topologies, were tested for this purpose. Finally, the product concentration (PGA activity in the medium) was estimated through a hybrid approach, using the growth rate inferred by the MLP NN, coupled to the cell-product yield, obtained from the fitting of the non-structured models. Another important information for this last algorithm was the knowledge that production of PGA was growth-associated, but with a 2hr-delay. The algorithm for inference was robust and accurate.Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisA grande importância da enzima penicilina G acilase (E.C.3.5.1.11), usada para a produção dos ácidos 6-aminopenicilânico (6-APA) e 7-aminocefalosporânico (7-ACA), compostos-chave na produção industrial de antibióticos &#946;-lactâmicos, foi a principal motivação deste trabalho. Através de realização de experimentos de produção
de PGA por Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14945 em reator convencional, utilizando sistema de aquisição de dados, foi possível monitorar em tempo real variáveis como, por exemplo, fração molar de oxigênio e dióxido de carbono nos gases de saída, pH, oxigênio dissolvido. Foram realizados cultivos em batelada e batelada alimentada tendo como
substratos limitantes tanto caseína hidrolisada enzimaticamente como aminoácidos livres. Obtiveram-se informações relacionadas ao tempo de cultivo, à estocagem do microrganismo e à adição e exclusão de nutrientes. Fontes usuais de carbono, como glicose, lactose e glicerol, quando utilizadas, promoviam o crescimento da massa celular sem, no entanto, aumentar a produção de PGA. O uso de aminoácidos como principal
substrato elevou em 2,5 vezes a produtividade. Observou-se, ainda, que a adição de ácido fenilacético (AFA) desde o início do cultivo não inibiu o crescimento do microrganismo.
As informações experimentais permitiram a proposição e validação de três modelos cinéticos não-estruturados deste processo, com um ou mais substrato(s) limitante(s). Como essas propostas se mostraram demasiadamente simplificadas, optouse
pelo uso de redes neurais como sensores baseados em  software , já que não se chegou a um modelo fenomenológico satisfatório. Para implementação do algoritmo de inferência baseado em rede neural,
mostrou-se necessário filtrar os ruídos das medidas provenientes do sistema de aquisição de forma a minimizar erros aleatórios da instrumentação. Propõe-se para isso filtro que utiliza redes recorrentes, combinadas a média móvel. As variáveis filtradas foram utilizadas numa segunda rede de identificação de padrões, que dividia o cultivo nas três principais fases do crescimento microbiano. O principal objetivo desta foi
identificar a fase de crescimento exponencial, que seria a enfocada pelo algoritmo de inferência. Para essa inferência, com base nas variáveis medidas em tempo real, treinaram-se redes com várias topologias e entradas, de modo a escolher as variáveis que possibilitassem o aprendizado dos aspectos essenciais da dinâmica do processo.

As certain portions or sometimes even the whole engine are released as open source software, these engines can be extended to build more serious applications at very little costs. The paper shows how these game engines can be used to create interactive 3D applications that present texture-mapped geospatial data. The integration of 3D data into such systems is discussed. Functionality like thematic queries can be implemented by extending the internal data structures and by modification of the game’s accompanying dynamic link libraries.",industry,894,not included

Fraud and abuse in medical claims have become a major concern within health insurance companies in Chile the last years due to the increasing losses in revenues. Processing medical claims is an exhausting manual task carried out by a few medical experts who have the responsibility of approving, modifying or rejecting the subsidies requested within a limited period from their reception. The proposed detection system uses one committee of multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) for each one of the entities involved in the fraud/abuse problem: medical claims, affiliates, medical professionals and employers. Results of the fraud detection system show a detection rate of approximately 75 fraudulent and abusive cases per month, making the detection 6.6 months earlier than without the system. The application of data mining to a real industrial problem through the implementation of an automatic fraud detection system changed the original non-standard medical claims checking process to a standardized process helping to fight against new, unusual and known fraudulent/abusive behaviors.",industry,896,included

It also presents solution claims, whose realization can lead to a long-term, macroeconomically optimal solution, both for the industry and academia. Key problems in robotics software in the industrial and the academic practice are a chronic lack of standardization, interoperability and reuse of software libraries, both proprietary and open source. For example, we still have not standardized the Kalman filter or particle filter that everyone can and wants to use, and the same holds for many other mature robotics software components such as kinematics and dynamics, control laws, or planning algorithms. As a result, thousands of (Ph.D.) person months are lost worldwide every year in reimplementing these things for the zillionth time, without any new contribution to software reuse. This pitiful state of the practice is not unique to robotics, and only a few engineering domains do it right: numerical linear algebra (starting many decades ago already); the World Wide Web [with (X)HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS), scalable vector graphics (SVG), and other W3C standards as the fundamental enablers]; the Java middleware ecosystem [XML processing, open services gateway initiative (OSGi, now obsolete), Eclipse, mobile phone frameworks, etc.]; and tools around the Object Management Group (OMG) standards of UML, SysML, and modeldriven architecture. These examples are not tied to specific applications (this is not a coincidence but a very wise design decision about modularity and decoupling!), and they all have healthy commercial and open-source offerings, with real and rapid innovation taking place in both software development models. Every section in this article focuses on one of the fundamental issues that has led to the retarded state of software in robotics and suggests a concrete solution.

,to_check,project-academic,Université Paris-Saclay,17/12/2018 00:00,project-academic,security in the cloud an anomaly based detection framework for the insider threats,project-academic," Cloud Computing (CC) opens new possibilities for more flexible and efficient services for Cloud Service Clients (CSCs). However, one of the main issues while migrating to the cloud is that what once was a private domain for CSCs, now is handled by a third-party, hence subject to their security policies. Therefore, CSCs' confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) should be ensured. In spite of the existence of protection mechanisms, such as encryption, the monitoring of the CIA properties becomes necessary. Additionally, new threats emerge every day, requiring more efficient detection techniques. The work presented in this document goes beyond the state of the art by treating the malicious insider threat, one of the least studied threats in CC. This is mainly due to the organizational and legal barriers from the industry, and therefore the lack of appropriate datasets for detecting it. We tackle this matter by addressing two challenges.First, the derivation of an extensible methodology for modeling the behavior of a user in a company. This abstraction of an employee includes intra psychological factors, contextual information and is based on a role-based approach. The behaviors follow a probabilistic procedure, where the malevolent motivations are considered to occur with a given probability in time.The main contribution, a design and implementation of an anomaly-based detection framework for the aforementioned threat. This implementation enriches itself by comparing two different observation points: a profile-based view from the local network of the company, and a cloud-end view that analyses data from the services with whom the clients interact. This allows the learning process of anomalies to benefit from two perspectives: (1) the study of both real and simulated traffic with respect to the cloud service's interaction, in favor of the characterization of anomalies; and (2) the analysis of the cloud service in order to aggregate data statistics that support the overall behavior characterization.The design of this framework empirically shows to detect a broader set of anomalies of the company's interaction with the cloud. This is possible due to the replicable and extensible nature of the mentioned insider model. Also, the proposed detection model takes advantage of the autonomic nature of a clustering machine learning technique, following an unsupervised, adaptive algorithm capable of characterizing the evolving behaviors of the users towards cloud assets. The solution efficiently tackles the detection of anomalies by showing high levels of clustering performance, while keeping a low False Positive Rate (FPR), ensuring the detection performance for threat scenarios where the threat comes from inside the enterprise",industry,899,not included

,to_check,project-academic,,18/08/2020 00:00,project-academic,climate econometrics an overview,project-academic," Climate econometrics is a new sub-discipline that has grown rapidly over the last few years. As greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are a major cause of climate change, and are generated by human activity, it is not surprising that the tool set designed to empirically investigate economic outcomes should be applicable to studying many empirical aspects of climate change. Economic and climate time series exhibit many commonalities. Both data are subject to non-stationarities in the form of evolving stochastic trends and sudden distributional shifts. Consequently, the well-developed machinery for modeling economic time series can be fruitfully applied to climate data. In both disciplines, we have imperfect and incomplete knowledge of the processes actually generating the data. As we donât know that data generating process (DGP), we must search for what we hope is a close approximation to it. The data modeling approach adopted at Climate Econometrics (http://www.climateeconometrics.org/) is based on a model selection methodology that has excellent properties for locating an unknown DGP nested within a large set of possible explanations, including dynamics, outliers, shifts, and non-linearities. The software we use is a variant of machine learning which implements multi-path block searches commencing from very general specifications to discover a well-specified and undominated model of the processes under analysis. To do so requires implementing indicator saturation estimators designed to match the problem faced, such as impulse indicators for outliers, step indicators for location shifts, trend indicators for trend breaks, multiplicative indicators for parameter changes, and indicators specifically designed for more complex phenomena that have a common reaction âshapeâ like the impacts of volcanic eruptions on temperature reconstructions. We also use combinations of these, inevitably entailing settings with more candidate variables than observations. Having described these econometric tools, we take a brief excursion into climate science to provide the background to the later applications. By noting the Earthâs available atmosphere and water resources, we establish that humanity really can alter the climate, and is doing so in myriad ways. Then we relate past climate changes to the âgreat extinctionsâ seen in the geological record. Following the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, building on earlier advances in scientific, technological and medical knowledge, real income levels per capita have risen dramatically globally, many killer diseases have been tamed, and human longevity has approximately doubled. However, such beneficial developments have led to a global explosion in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. These are also subject to many relatively sudden shifts from major wars, crises, resource discoveries, technology and policy interventions. Consequently, stochastic trends, large shifts and numerous outliers must all be handled in practice to develop viable empirical models of climate phenomena. Additional advantages of our econometric methods for doing so are detecting the impacts of important policy interventions as well as improved forecasts. The econometric approach we outline can handle all these jointly, which is essential to accurately characterize non-stationary observational data. Few approaches in either climate or economic modeling consider all such effects jointly, but a failure to do so leads to mis-specified models and hence incorrect theory evaluation and policy analyses. We discuss the hazards of modeling wide-sense non-stationary data (namely data not just with stochastic trends but also distributional shifts), which also serves to describe our notation. The application of the methods is illustrated by two detailed modeling exercises. The first investigates the causal role of CO2 in Ice Ages, where a simultaneous-equations system is developed to characterize land ice volume, temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels as non-linear functions of measures of the Earthâs orbital path round the Sun. The second turns to analyze the United Kingdomâs highly non-stationary annual CO2 emissions over the last 150 years, walking through all the key modeling stages. As the first country into the Industrial Revolution, the UK is one of the first countries out, with per capita annual CO2 emissions now below 1860âs levels when our data series begin, a reduction achieved with little aggregate cost. However, very large decreases in all greenhouse gas emissions are still required to meet the UKâs 2050 target set by its Climate Change Act in 2008 of an 80% reduction from 1970 levels, since reduced to a net zero target by that date, as required globally to stabilize temperatures. The rapidly decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies offer hope of further rapid emission reductions in that area, illustrated by a dynamic scenario analysis.",industry,902,not included

The community is actively researching an extensive set of topics, ranging from the small (e.g., energy-independent embedded devices) to the large (e.g., brain-scale deep learning), simultaneously addressing technology discontinuities (End of Moore's Law and EnergyWall), new challenges in security and privacy, and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).

While industry is applying some of these technologies, its efforts are necessarily focused on only a few areas, and on relatively short-term horizons. This offers academic researchers the opportunity to attack the problems with a broader and longer-term view. Further, in recent times, the computer systems community has started to pay increasing attention to non-performance measures, such as security, complexity, and power. To make progress in this multi-objective world, the composition of research teams needs to change. Teams have to become inter-disciplinary, enabling the flow of ideas across computing fields.

While many research directions are interesting, this report outlines a few high-priority areas where inter-disciplinary research is likely to have a high payoff:

a) Developing the components for a usable planet-scale Internet of Things (IoT), with provably energy-efficient devices. This report envisions a highly-available, geographically distributed, heterogeneous large-scale IoT system with the same efficiency, maintainability, and usability as today's data centers. This planet-scale IoT will be populated by many computationally-sophisticated IoT devices that are ultra-low power and operate energy-independently.

b) Rethinking the hardware-software security contract in the age of AI. In light of the recent security vulnerabilities, this report argues for building hardware abstractions that communicate security guarantees, and for allowing software to communicate its security and privacy requirements to the hardware. Further, security and privacy mechanisms should be integrated into the disruptive emerging technologies that support AI.

c) Making AI a truly dependable technology that is usable by all the citizens in all settings. As AI frameworks automate an increasing number of critical operations, this report argues for end-to-end dependable AI, where both the hardware and the software are understood and verified. Further, AI needs to turn from a centralized tool into a capability easily usable by all the citizens in all settings to meet an ever expanding range of needs.

d) Developing solutions to tackle extreme complexity, possibly based on formal methods. This report argues for the need to tame the explosion of system complexity and heterogeneity by creating new abstractions and complexity-management solutions. Such solutions need to be accessible to domain experts. An important step towards this goal is to scale out and extend formal methods for the real world.

Here in this paper we present a state of the art literature review which reveals the past and present work done for automating Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using AI. Keywords — Artificial Intelligence, Code Generation, Requirements Engineering, SDLC, Software Design, Software Estimation, Software Testing. I. I NTRODUCTION The disciplines of artificial intelligence and software engineering have developed separately. There is not much exchange of research results between them. AI research techniques make it possible to perceive, reason and act. Research in software engineering is concerned with supporting engineers to developed better software in less period. Rech and Altoff(2008) say ""The disciplines of artificial intelligences and software engineering have many commonalities. Both deals with modeling real world objects from the real world like business process, expert knowledge, or process models."" Now a day's several research directions of both disciplines come closer together and are beginning to build new research areas. Software agents play an important role as research objects in distributed AI(DAI) as well as in Agent Oriented Software Engineering(AOSE). Knowledge-based System(KBS) are being examine for Learning Software Organizations (LSO) as well as Knowledge Engineering(KE). Ambient intelligence(AmI) a new research area for distributed, non-intrusive, and intelligent software system both from the direction of how to build these system as well as how to designed the collaboration between system. Lastly computational intelligence(CI) plays an important role in research about software analysis or project management as well as knowledge discovery in machine learning or databases.[1] Artificial Intelligence techniques, which aim to create software systems that exhibit some form of human intelligence, have been employed to assist or automate the activities in software engineering. Software inspections are been applied with great success to detect defects in different kinds of software documents such as specifications, design, test plans, or source code by many researchers.[2] Automated software engineering is a research area which is constantly developing new methodologies and technologies. It includes toolsets and frameworks based on mathematical models (theorem provers and model checkers), requirements-driven developments and reverse engineering (design, coding, verification validation), software management (configurations and projects), and code drivers (generators, analyzers, and visualizers).

Nelle tre differenti aggettivazioni è racchiuso uno dei mandati della Tecnologia e della relativa Cultura tecnologica progettuale da sviluppare nel prossimo futuro: la richiesta di sostenibilità del fare umano per le generazioni future (Sustainable), di solidità e affidabilità dei comportamenti e delle prestazioni (Nachhaltige), di durabilità nel tempo dei prodotti delle trasformazioni (Durable).

L'altro grande mandato della Cultura tecnologica nella nostra epoca è quello di offrire non solo risposte 'dinamiche' nella dimensione temporale di medio-lungo termine alle crescenti esigenze di sostenibilità/affidabilità/durabilità, ma anche risposte 'dinamiche' nello spazio reale e nel tempo presente e di breve termine supportando l'Architettura nella sua altrettanto assoluta necessità di essere 'adattiva' e 'resiliente' ai cambiamenti già in atto sul piano climatico e ambientale.

Cultura tecnologica significa dunque profonda consapevolezza degli obiettivi da perseguire progettualmente, indissolubilmente legata ad un'attitudine alla visione sistemica dei problemi, ad un'impostazione metodologica delle strategie da tracciare e promuovere, ad un'intima sapienza degli aspetti di fattibilità e realizzabilità delle azioni da sperimentare, monitorare, consolidare nel tempo.

D'altra parte tutti i maggiori centri di ricerca e sperimentazione dell'area dell'Architettura nei Paesi avanzati pongono quale nodo focale dei processi di concezione, progettazione e realizzazione di qualsiasi tipo di intervento trasformativo delle nostre realtà quello caratterizzato dall'approccio tecnologico, in cui nei diversi contesti la Architectural Technology, la Baukonstruktion, la Technologie de l'Architecture, la Construcción en Arquitectura non rappresentano solo un ambito disciplinare (pealtro da sempre a vocazione fortemente interdisciplinare) ma, di più, la dimensione logica e culturale nella quale si coordinano e ruotano le complesse declinazioni e i differenti caratteri del progetto.

Nel rinvenire gli elementi di innovazione propri della Cultura tecnologica nell'approcciare e sviluppare ricerca e sperimentazione sui temi dell'ambiente e dell'energia vi è in primis la capacità di perseguire al contempo tre categorie di obiettivi ""alti"" prestazionali: efficienza delle azioni nel controllarne rendimenti e risultati; efficacia complessiva delle strategie nel verificarne il rapporto tra efficienza conseguita e quantità di risorse coinvolte e impiegate nei processi per raggiungere quei risultati; soddisfazione degli utenti nel vivere quelle condizioni di efficienza e nel percepire o addirittura esser coinvolti in quelle dimensioni di efficacia.

La concezione innovativa di scenario che è aperta dall'evoluzione del significato di efficacia pone in primo piano la questione della 'scarsità di risorse' e tiene in massima considerazione -fino al punto di farla sua nei recenti sviluppi a più ancora in quelli a venire nel prossimo futuro - l'accezione di 'Economia circolare' (asse portante della visione della Green Economy) che, secondo il recentissimo Piano di Azione Globale della Comunità Europea, attiene ad un sistema complesso in cui ""il valore dei prodotti, dei materiali, dell'energia e delle risorse è mantenuto quanto più a lungo possibile e la produzione di emissioni, inquinamento, scarti e rifiuti è ridotta al massimo"" (European Commission, 2017) e in cui, secondo il report della Agenzia Europea per l'Ambiente, centrale è ""contrastare il depauperamento delle risorse naturali, re-immettere nel mercato le risorse in dismissione ed agevolare il recupero delle risorse di valore"" (European Environment Agency, 2016).

In questo senso protagonista assoluto di tale innovazione è quell'approccio ecosistemico ai problemi, alle questioni in gioco e alle strategie ed azioni per risolverli, che fa fondamentalmente riferimento alla visione di tipo 'Life Cycle' strutturante il senso stesso di 'sostenibilità' di uno sviluppo capace di sostanziare la 'circolarità' del sistema economico, la 'mitigabilità' della crisi climatica, l''efficientabilità' della questione energetica, la 'capitalizzabilità' del patrimonio naturale, la 'inclusività' del benessere e la 'rigenerabilità' delle città; e di includere il concetto di 'Costo ambientale' in tutte le strategie e azioni da questi assi sottese.The role of technological culture in planning, seen in light of the three major challenges raised by the environmental and energy-related issues of our time, meaning climate change, limited resources and excessive energy consumption, is a key role, and one that we ignore at our peril when it comes to seeking out, in informed fashion, a renewal in the conditions of inhabiting the contexts of Europe and the rest of the world, a quest that necessarily brings into play concepts which differ with respect to their terminology, but yet prove quite similar when it comes to the board range of concepts covered and the wealth of their underlying objectives: Sustainable Development, Nachhaltige Entwicklung and Dévéloppement Durable.

Ensconced within each of these descriptors is one of the vital tasks that technology and the related cultural of technology must fulfil in the near future: responding to the request for sustainability in human  endeavours in future generations (Sustainable), as well as for integrity and reliability in terms of conduct and performance (Nachhaltige), together with the durability over time of the products of transformations (Durable).

The other major task of cultural technology in our time is to provide responses that prove 'dynamic' not only over the medium-long term, with respect to meeting the growing need for sustainability/reliability /durability, but that are also 'dynamic' within real space and at the present time, in the short term, supporting architecture’s equally absolute need to be 'adaptable' and 'resilient' in response to changes currently affecting the climate and the environment.

Technological culture, therefore, means possessing a thoroughgoing knowledge of the objectives to be pursued through planning, irrevocably linked to a leaning towards a systemic vision of issues, as well as a methodological approach to the strategies to be outline and promoted, plus an intimate familiarity with the considerations of feasibility and practicality tied to the initiatives to be tested, monitored and built up over time.

For that matter, all the major centres of research and experimentation in the architectural sectors of the developed countries posit the technological approach as a vital factor in the processes of conceptualisation, planning and implementation of any type of initiative meant to transform our existing realties, with the result that the various contexts of Architectural Technology, Baukonstruktion, Technologie de l'Architecture and Construcción en Arquitectura represent not only a disciplinary realm (albeit one with a marked interdisciplinary bent) but, even more to the point, the logical and cultural dimension within which the various manifestations and characteristics of planning are coordinated and brought into focus.

In identifying the innovative features displayed by technological culture as it addresses and develops research and experimentation on environmental and energy-related topics, the first observation to be made is its ability to simultaneously pursue three different categories of ""advanced"" objectives involving performance: the efficiency of initiatives in terms of controlling yields and results; the overall effectiveness of strategies in light of assessments of the ratio between the efficiency achieved and the quantities of resources involved and utilised in the processes enacted to reach those results; the satisfaction of the users of those conditions of efficiency as they perceive, or even become involved in, the new dimensions of effectiveness.

The innovative approach to conceptualisation of scenarios brought about by the evolution in the meaning of effectiveness highlights the issue of 'scarce resources' while placing the utmost importance – to the point of absorbing it in recent developments, a trend that shall become even more pronounced in the near future – on the framework of the 'Circular Economy' outlook (a cornerstone of the vision of a Green Economy), an outlook that, according to the recent Global Action Plan of the European  Community, points to a complex system in which, ""The value of products, materials, energy and resources is maintained for as long as possible, while the production of emissions, pollution, scrap and waste is reduced to the greatest possible extent"" (European Commission, 2017), with key importance placed on, ""Contrasting the impoverishment of natural resources, reintroducing discarded resources onto the market and facilitating the recovery of resources of value "" (European Environment Agency, 2016).

Seen in this light, the key ingredient to a similar innovation is the eco-systemic approach taken to the problems and issues addressed, as well as to the strategies and initiatives enacted to resolve them, an outlook that essentially consists of a 'Life Cycle' vision able to provide the structure for the fundamental 'sustainability' of a mode of development that succeeds in supporting the 'circularity' of the economic system, together with the potential for mitigating the climate crisis, for increasing energy efficiency, for capitalising on natural resources, for making wellbeing more inclusive while regenerating cities, with the concept of 'environmental cost' becoming an integral part of all the strategies and actions underlying such efforts",smart cities,905,not included

HCLC 之軟硬體共同設計與實作以及MAC 排程器矽智財之電子系統層級 (Electronic System Level; ESL)驗證，開發現今儀器無法量測以及測試的WiMax 驗證平台。 5. 通用於OFDM/Scalable OFDMA-based 之跨協定控制，以利未來延伸到其他之無線網路標準，例如IEEE 802.22 Cognitive Radio，IEEE 802.11n MIMO 之QoS 排程器等。本計畫從過去的研究成果來延伸，在跨協定QoS 控制中，在標準已經定義的Power Sleep Behaviors (Listen/Active)以及Ranging 以外，另加入路由控制、PDU 長度、排程器計算等造成能源消耗的考量，這是IEEE 802.16 標準中缺乏定義的部份。不同於使用最佳化理論之硬式計算(hard computing)演算法，我們說明使用軟式計算 (soft computing)的原因。除了IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS)在CIS 雜誌中所揭出的Emergent Applications 包含了網路控制之外，我們定義了WiMax 問題，說明無線網路無法根據固定的機率模型假設以及固定的環境因素來進行推導，因此無法獲得以 constraints 與 controls 來表示 的objective function 的close-form。無線網路的與變數狀態非常多且動態，無法根據專家知識逐一定義模糊規則或進行最佳化之推導，本計畫使用簡單控制規則，在不同通訊協定層進行控制，每一協定層的模糊規則展開之後，規則數可以隨著所跨協定層數獲得exponential 成長，我們以Homomorphism 來說明並規範上下層之間狀態的關係。針對這樣的網路控制架構，我們稱之為階層式跨協定控制 (Hierarchical Cross-Layer Control; HCLC)。本計畫分析WiMax 在動態無線網路環境下的延遲與QoS 參數的關係，以廣義模糊自動機當作其行為模型，並整合能量消耗的模型。自動機之行為實現(output function)利用過去國科會計畫成果—單一維度HCLC控制架構來延伸。因為WiMax 之OFDMA 與802.16m 的 MIMO 中之特性，跨協定所必須完成的是多目標與多參數之控制，方法是延伸到高階宇集(universe)的HCLC。我們並發現這樣的一個架構是一個比傳統Hierarchical Tagaki-Sugeno Control 還要廣義的Paradigm，本計劃除針對這樣的架構進行穩定性以及效率的理論分析之外，並設計實驗證明這樣的架構即時有效地進行IEEE 802.16e/j 的QoS 控制，本計畫在第一年已經證明HCLC 應用於802.16e/j 的兩種重要的公平性：inter-class fairness 與intra-class fairness，這是大多文獻中未考慮到的部份。在以嵌入式系統以及矽智財設計、實作、驗證WiMax 跨協定排程器方面，我們考慮SoC 設計流程來說明，以往任何通訊網路之矽智財驗證平台無法驗證出在不明確網路下之可行性(特別是無線網路)，必須在花費大筆經費和時間整合到SoC 並且下線(tape out) 之後，再花許多時間進行embedded software 之porting，然後才發現所設計之SIP 是否有瑕疵(bug)，若發現瑕疵，現有之積體電路設計或模擬驗證軟體並無法針對通訊網路的部份進行除錯，即使是昂貴的SoC 驗證工具(例如具有AMBA SoC bus 輸出入介面之 ARM based 平台)也無法立即進行驗證晶片在通訊網路上之行為，僅能提供訊號波形、指令週期等層級之觀察與控制。而對於通訊網路，還必須花費成本複製多台才能夠架構出基本網路拓樸(topology)，也僅能進行基本實驗。即便最後成功，市場之優勢早已不再，對於許多design houses 來說，這是一個難關。本計畫所產出之Electronic System Level (ESL)驗證平台，可以大幅縮短Design House 在嵌入式系統設計驗證之時程，並大幅縮小開發成本。由於我們已經完成WLAN MANET 之ESL 架構，此架構基於HCLC 控制模型，成功驗證了FPGA 以及HCLC 跨協定演算法於MANET 下的行為，因此這樣的一個HCLC ESL Verification 平台， 最適用於Architecture/Algorithm 以及 Hardware/Software Co-design，對於無線網路矽智財以及嵌入式系統初期之開發最具幫助。綜合以上目標以及原因之說明，本計畫擬定接下來兩年之研究方法、步驟以及個別目標，本著研究應該持續且深入的觀念，沿著過去研究成果的脈絡，來規劃未來兩年的研究。第一年已經完成原訂第一年之目標： 高階宇集HCLC 控制模型以及 OFDMA-based 802.16e-2005 Mobile WiMax 以及802.16j (MMR)的跨協定排程器軟體元件；第二年將擴充到OFDMA-based 的802.16j/m，整合PHY 與MIMO 能量消耗模型(特別是mobile node 上行部份)，完成具Relaying 功能且支援MIMO 的IEEE 802.16 e/j/m Mobile WiMax 跨協定控制器；第三年依據WLAN 之ESL 經驗以及第一年與第二年之研究成果，實作OFDMA-based WiMax 排程器矽智財，並進行軟硬體系統整合，以及完成ESL 驗證平台。總結本計畫的創意以及特點即是：1. 所完成之系統以及QoS 矽智財能夠滿足QoS 之外，在透過跨協定的架構下還能同時inter-與intra-class 的公平性；2. 達到節能的目標；3. 完成支援Cross-Layer Design 的WiMAX 通訊網路晶片矽智財；4. 結合網路模擬器與Hierarchical Cross-Layer 控制模型完成低成本之ESL 平台。以未來之擴充性來說，ESL 驗證平台之應用，不僅用於矽智財之設計，也不僅用於MAC 層之協定驗證，對於跨協定設計中任何演算法之驗證、嵌入式系統之演算法驗證、…、等等，均能發揮其功能。而模糊自動機可以應用之範圍甚廣，例如機器學習，以智慧型的方式學習網路的狀態空間，朝實體層之跨協定調變控制以產生最佳頻寬利用等。對於本計畫利用人工智慧與軟式計算理論為工具，應用到通訊網路，並實現在SoC 領域，本著過去計劃之成功經驗，向系統整合方向邁進，成果將非常豐碩。[[abstract]]This project was planned in three-year execution. The first year was granted and till now very good results has been obtained and published in an international journal (SCIE indexed). In this proposal, we revise according to the reviewers’ comments (cf. Table C012-2). We also include the results descriptions of the first year execution and present how/what we have prepared for the following two years wishing that the research can be continued. Since IEEE 802.16 WiMax wireless networks are developed, it becomes the future infrastructure of many developed and developing countries. New related standards and their amendments are fervidly discussed. The IEEE 802.16e-2005 has defined Mobile WiMax and the latest drafting 802.16j and the “pre-drafting” 802.16m even try to respectively promote multi-hop relay and mobility beyond the original throughput. In these finalized, drafting, and pre-drafting standards, most are about Media Access Control (MAC) and PHYsical layers (PHY). What insights are with Quality of Service (QoS) and we see that QoS is a problem relating not only upper layers but also MAC and PHY. Especially for WiMax, QoS realization in MAC and PHY are emphasized by many researches. Inheriting the experiences of previous projects since IEEE 802.11e EDCA, HCCA, and currently the general TDMA-based QoS controls, we propose the following researches to strike into IEEE 802.16e/j Wave 2 and so as into general Scalable OFDMA (SOFDMA) based QoS control: 1. Define Hierarchical Cross-Layer Control (HCLC) for 802.16e/j/m mobile and multi-hop relay QoS 2. Study Generalized Fuzzy Automata (GFA) defined with high-type and high-level fuzzy universes over lattices to mathematically realize WiMax behaviors and characteristics 3. Design HCLC scheduler and allocator (together called controller) according to the GFA theory where high-type fuzzy universes are used for multi-parameter and multi-objective control. In this way, we can adjust QoS parameters while the wireless communications are still compatible with the standards.4. Perform HCLC software-hardware co-design, implement the MAC QoS controller Silicon Intellectual Property (SIP), and its Electronic System Level (ESL) verifications. Develop WiMax verification platform with cross-layer features that modern instruments cannot measure. 5. Research generic cross-layer control for the OFDM/Scalable OFDMA-based wireless such that we can extend the WiMax QoS control research into future standards such as IEEE 802.22 Cognitive Radio and IEEE 802.11n MIMO. This project extends the valuable results of previous executed/executing projects. Beside cross-layer, and beside defined power sleep behaviors (Listen/Active) and ranging, we also consider energy consumption about routing control, PDU length, and scheduling computation. These are what the IEEE 802.16 does not define. Unlike those hard computation algorithms using optimization theory, we explain the feasibility using soft computing. Beside the reason explained in the Computational Intelligence Magazine published by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) that one of the emergent applications of soft computing is network control, we additionally and in detail defined problems of WiMax QoS control. In this proposal we explain why wireless networks cannot be modeled by fixed probability model and why their performances cannot be derived using fixed environmental factors. Consequently, optimization using hard computing algorithms can not express objective functions in terms of constraints and control parameters. However, using soft computing we still suffer difficulties. The variables and states of wireless networks forms a large and dynamic space such at that no expertise can define detail fuzzy rules. Therefore, in this project, we try to use simple fuzzy rules distributed in different protocol layers. Expanding the rules in the protocol layers, we found that the number of fuzzy rules exponentially grows along the number of layers. We adopt homomorphism concept to explain and constrain inter-layer states and variables. We called this network control architecture the Hierarchical Cross-Layer Control (HCLC). For WiMax, this project analyses the relationship between delay and QoS parameters when network is highly dynamic. Then, we use generalized fuzzy automata to realize the behavior of the WiMax network and integrate energy consumption model. The realization of automata (output function) inherits previous projects’ results – the one dimensional HCLC control to extend new SOFDMA-based control with multiple objectives and multiple parameters. The method used is adopting high-type and high-level fuzzy universes in the HCLC. We even find out that such HCLC architecture is a more generic paradigm than defined in so-called Hierarchical Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy control. This project will analyze the stability and efficiency of this fuzzy control architecture. In the first half year, we design the experiment to prove that HCLC efficiently and effectively perform IEEE 802.16e/j QoS control while at the same time keep the fairness that few articles concern. Considering the embedded system design, silicon intellectual property implementation, and verification of the WiMax QoS controller, this project provides a low cost solution. According to known SoC design flow, no SIP verification platform can perform verification of SIP behavior under realistic wireless network environment before accomplishment of SoC integration, tapering, and embedded software porting. It’s a long journey to accomplish all these tasks. If a bug is found in the SIP, no EDA tool can remove it dedicatedly for network communication. Even using costly SoC verification tool such as ARM-based platform with AMBA SoC bus on the PCB, we still cannot observe the SIP behavior under wireless networks. Using costly SoC verification tool, what only we can do is signal wave measurement, observation and control at the instruction and cycle accuracy. For basic networking experiments, we still even have to replicate platforms to construct the basic network topology. After we success eventually, the market opportunity is gone. This is a tuff work for design houses. The verification platform of this project will be superior over traditional ones and obviously shorten the development of networking SIPs. Thus reduce the cost effectively. In previous project, we had accomplished WLAN MANET ESL verification where HCLC control model successfully cooperates with FPGA hardware. This is the ever first verification platform that verify behaviours of real hardware and cross-layer algorithm under MANET. The platform will be extended for WiMAX MMR since it optimally match hardware architecture and cross-layer algorithms and is the best tool for hardware/software co-design. According to the above descriptions, we project three-year research methods, steps, and objectives. Based on the concept that research should be always continuing and burrowing to the deep, we follow the direction of previous research projects. In the first half year, we already accomplished high-type HCLC control model and its cross-layer scheduler software component for OFDMA-based 802.16e/j Mobile Multi-hop Relay (MMR) WiMax. In the second year, we will extend the HCLC controller to 802.16j/m and integrate energy consumption model to accomplish embedded cross-layer scheduler software component for multi-hop relaying and mobile WiMax. In the third year, we will implement the OFDMA-based WiMax scheduler and its electronic system level (ESL) verification platform. Summarizing the originality and features, we have: first, the system and QoS SIP not only guarantee QoS but also intra- and inter-class fairness; sencond, the QoS and fairness guarantees are energy-aware; third, we accomplish HCLC SIP for general WiMax; fourth, we produce low cost ESL verification platform integrating the network simulator and hierarchical cross-layer control. For future extension, fuzzy automata theory applies in many areas such as machine learning, intelligent network state space learning, and cross-layer physical layer modulation for spectrum optimization. The resulting SIP verification platform is also useful in many cases in addition to SIP and MAC layer control. For example, it should be also useful in any cross-layer algorithms, embedded system algorithms, …, etc. This project covers several research fields including artificial intelligence, computing theory, communication networks, and VLSI. With the basis of previous successful projects, we progress toward system integration and the results will also be very plentiful and valuable.[[note]]NSC98-2221-E327-02",smart cities,906,not included

The views and conclusions contained herein are the author’s and shouldn’t be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of other parties.The Collaborative Operations for Personnel Recovery (Co-OPR) project sought to
provide collaborative task support for a Search and Rescue coordination center. The
project aimed to create a prototype “Personnel Recovery (Experimental) Pack” (PREP) and to demonstrate its use.

A number of requirements capture, knowledge gathering and transition workshops and
meetings were held. This included an initial requirements setting workshop early in 2005,
meetings at the USJFCOM Joint Personnel Recovery Agency’s (JPRA) Personnel
Recovery Education and Training Center (PRETC) in Fredericksburg, Virginia in June
2005, a review meeting in Edinburgh in August 2005, and attendance at a Command Post
Exercise (CPX) at the PRETC in November 2005. These initially established the potential
areas for use of Co-OPR and I-X tools in training exercises. In the second project year such tools were developed and tested using a training exercise as held at the PRETC, using observers from PRETC and USJFCOM and an evaluation expert from USJFCOM/J9.

The project was provided with a rich set of urban and rural scenarios by JPRA/PRETC
which together are unclassified versions of scenarios used within the PRETC training
courses and Command Post Exercises. At the time, these stretched the capabilities of the
current and envisaged technologies within Co-OPR/I-X. Refinement of the scenarios
alongside PRETC, and knowledge engineering to capture information on standard operating procedures and responses were a key part of making the work relevant to the potential real use of Co-OPR/I-X for Personnel Recovery.

The core I-X technology was packaged into a number of checkpoint releases to make
available the features required to meet the application needs. I-X version 4.3 released in November 2005 to checkpoint the results achieved on the first 12 months of work with
the PRETC. It formed a basis for the work on really using the technology at the PRETC.
New “white cell” aids for training were made available in an initial version. A new I-Sim
simulation capability, and advanced option exploration tools have all been improved
significantly to make them more usable, including the features of the I-Plan AI planner and its capability for plan repair after failures. The features of the Domain Editor (I-DE) and its ability to browse and update or augment standard operating procedure knowledge dynamically during missions were enhanced. The final release of I-X that includes all the new developments achieved in the Co-OPR project is version 4.5.

The results of the work were packaged, along with Personnel Recovery domain specific
models, as a web site and/or CD which could be considered as a prototype “Personnel
Recovery (Experimental) Pack” of tools to assist a Joint Personnel Recovery Center
(JPRC) and associated operational staff in performing their operations. The versions of
PREP produced were used in one workshop or Command Post Exercise at the PRETC
under guidance from Dr. Jeff Hansberger at training related workshops already organized
by USJFCOM/J9 Expt. and Fred Kleibacker, the (now former) Director of the PRETC in
Fredericksburg, Virginia. Co-OPR team members were engaged with these workshops to
to show the tools in realistic settings, to assist with training where possible, and to gather experimental feedback.

Realistic use of tools for Personnel Recovery requires that the systems can work with
emerging technology for geo-positioning, survival radios, evasion aids, robotic or semiautomated rescue aids or robots, and doctrine or tactics, techniques and procedures for Personnel Recovery. A number of short studies of these “complementary technologies” were made which explored deployment and inter-working aspects of these with the Co-OPR/I-X technology",smart cities,907,not included

In particular, the technology for simultaneous presentation of virtual objects to multiple users through space sharing is important for applications such as product demonstrations, design meetings, surgical support, or competitive games. However, such space-sharing technology alone can share virtual objects in the same space, but it cannot share remote objects as virtual objects with each other.In this research, as a proposal for the use of technology to mutually share remote objects as virtual objects, I will develop an AR game system that can communicate and compete with each other in the same way as real competitive games even in remote areas, by using a 360-degree omni-directional laser scanner to acquire the position and posture of a real radio-controlled car in each user\u27s space, and using network communication technology to mutually share this information and reproduce it as a virtual object in real time",multimedia,908,not included

We show that our approach easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each case. Using sim-to-real transfer, we deploy trained policies in the real world on the SpaceBok robot placed on an experimental testbed designed for 2-D microgravity experiments.

On the one hand, it considers the study of trust relationships towards the ""non-human agents"" that are the contemporary technological tools (algorithms and data that define artificial intelligence); on the other hand, it undertakes to conceptualize the authority that these tools are acquiring. The starting point is that the contemporary deployment of AI relies on forms of trust in machines shared between their designers and users, who appear to be the ""cement"" of the uses that guarantee the efficiency of the machines. However, this trust is less directed towards tools considered as neutral than towards personalized or even personified entities. Artificial intelligences, analyzed in the context of their uses, are already presented as something other than neutral instruments. Although still poorly qualified ontologically, they are already no longer simple tools, but agents. Through the services they render and the influence they already exert on behaviors, they acquire a real action that needs to be documented and conceptualized. This approach in political philosophy wants to examine the form of authority thus generated, notably by imagining experimental devices to test the hypotheses.Cette contribution se donne deux objectifs. D'une part, elle envisage l'étude des relations de confiance envers les « agents non-humains » que sont les outils technologiques contemporains (algorithmes et données qui définissent l'intelligence artificielle) ; de l'autre, elle entreprend de conceptualiser l'autorité que ces outils sont en train d'acquérir. Le constat de départ est que le déploiement contemporain de l'IA repose sur des formes de confiance envers les machines partagées entre leurs concepteurs et les usagers, qui apparaissent comme le « ciment » des usages garantissant l'efficacité des machines. Or cette confiance s'adresse moins à des outils considérés comme neutres qu'à des entités personnalisées voire personnifiées. Les intelligences artificielles, analysées dans le contexte de leurs usages, se présente déjà comme autre chose que des instruments neutres. Bien qu'encore mal qualifiés sur le plan ontologique, ce ne sont déjà plus de simples outils, mais des agents. Via les services qu'ils rendent et l'influence qu'ils exercent déjà sur les comportements, ils acquièrent une action réelle qu'il convient de documenter et de conceptualiser. Cette démarche en philosophie politique veut examiner la forme d'autorité ainsi engendrée, notamment en imaginant des dispositifs expérimentaux pour tester les hypothèses",multimedia,910,not included

,to_check,core,,22/01/2021 00:00,core,learning audio and image representations with bio-inspired trainable feature extractors,,"Since when very young, we can quickly learn new concepts, and distinguish between different kinds of object or sound. If we see a single object or hear a particular sound, we are then able to recognize such sample or even different versions of it in other scenarios. As an example, if one sees a iron chair and associates the object to the general concept of ""chairs"", he will be able to detect and recognize also wooden or wicker chairs. Similarly, when we hear the sound of a particular event, such as a scream, we are then able to recognize other kinds of scream that occur in different environments. We continuously learn representations of the real world, which we then use in order to understand new and changing environments.In the field of pattern recognition, traditional methods typically require a careful design of data representations (i.e. features), which involves considerable domain knowledge and effort by experts. Recently, approaches for automated learning of representations from training data were introduced and based on popular deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Representation learning aims at avoiding engineering of hand-crafted features and providing automatically learned features suitable for the recognition tasks. In this work, we proposed novel trainable filters for representation learning in audio and image processing. The structure of these filters is not fixed in the implementation but rather configured directly from single prototype patterns of interest [4].In the context of audio processing, we focused on the problem of audio event detection and classification in noisy environments, also in cases where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is null or negative. We released two data sets, namely the MIVIA audio events and the MIVIA road events data sets, and obtained baseline results (recognition rate of about 85%) with a real-time method for event detection based on the bag of features classification scheme [3, 2].We designed novel trainable feature extractors, which we call COPE (Combination of Peaks of Energy), that are able to detect specific constellations of energy peak points in time-frequency representations of input audio signals [8]. The particular constellation of energy peaks to be detected by a COPE feature extractor is determined in an automatic configuration process performed on a given prototype sound. The design of COPE feature extractors was inspired by some functions of the cochlea membrane and the inner hair cells in the inner auditory system, which convert the sound pressure waves into neural stimuli on the auditory nerve.We proposed a method that uses COPE feature extractors together with a classification system to perform real-time audio event detection and classification, also in cases where sounds have null and negative SNR. The performance results (recognition rate over 90%) that we obtained on several benchmarking data sets for audio events detection in different contexts are higher than state-of-the-art approaches.In the second part of the work, we introduced B-COSFIRE filters for detection of elongated and curvilinear patterns in images and apply them to the delineation of blood vessels in retinal images [1, 6]. The B-COSFIRE filters are trainable, that is their structure is automatically configured from prototype elongated patterns. The design of the B-COSFIRE filters is inspired by the functions of some neurons, called simple cells, in area V1 of the visual system, which fire when presented with line or contour stimuli. A B-COSFIRE filter achieves orientation selectivity by computing the weighted geometric mean of the output of a pool of Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filters, whose supports are aligned in a collinear manner. Rotation invariance is efficiently obtained by appropriate shiftings of the DoG filter responses.After configuring a large bank of B-COSFIRE filters selective for vessels (i.e. lines) and vessel-endings (i.e. line-endings) of various thickness (i.e. scale), we employed different techniques based on information theory and machine learning to select an optimal subset of B-COSFIRE filters for the vessel delineation task [5, 7]. We considered the selected filters as feature extractors to construct a pixel-wise feature vector which we used in combination with a classifier to classify the pixels in the testing image as vessel and non-vessel pixels. We carried out experiments on public benchmarking data sets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE DB1 and HRF data sets) and the results that we achieved are higher than many existing methods.We studied the computational requirements of the proposed algorithms in order to evaluate their applicabilityin real-world applications and the fulfillment of real-time constraints given by the considered problems. The MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithms are publicly released for research purposes.This work contributes to the development of algorithms for representation learning in audio and imageprocessing and promotes their use in higher-level pattern recognition systems",multimedia,912,not included

performance for message passing algorithms on arbitrary graphs. We show for the
first time that the classical computer vision problem of bundle adjustment (BA)
can be solved extremely fast on a graph processor using Gaussian Belief
Propagation. Our simple but fully parallel implementation uses the 1216 cores
on a single IPU chip to, for instance, solve a real BA problem with 125
keyframes and 1919 points in under 40ms, compared to 1450ms for the Ceres CPU
library. Further code optimisation will surely increase this difference on
static problems, but we argue that the real promise of graph processing is for
flexible in-place optimisation of general, dynamically changing factor graphs
representing Spatial AI problems. We give indications of this with experiments
showing the ability of GBP to efficiently solve incremental SLAM problems, and
deal with robust cost functions and different types of factors.Comment: Published in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision

Les IIoT apportent de nouvelles opportunités aux sites de production telles que la diminution des coûts des opérations et l’augmentation de la productivité dans le but d’une exploitation optimale. La technologie IIoT révolutionnera les procédés de fabrication industrielle en permettant l’acquisition des quantités importantes de données, à des vitesses beaucoup plus élevées, et bien plus efficaces qu’auparavant. Un certain nombre d’entreprises innovantes ont commencé à mettre en oeuvre l’IIoT en exploitant des appareils connectés intelligents dans leurs usines (c’est ce qu’on appelle les usines intelligentes ou Industrie 4.0). Dans une perspective d’acquisition des données, l’internet des objets a favorisé l’inclusion des sous-systèmes ainsi que leurs analyses en temps réel. Pour ce faire, l’Industrie 4.0 introduit un concept de production numérisée en permettant une intégration souple et agile de nouveaux modèles commerciaux tout en maintenant les coûts de fabrications et l’efficacité à un niveau raisonnable. Dans ce projet de recherche, nous allons étudier la maintenance prédictive des installations industrielles. Cette tâche est essentielle au bon fonctionnement de l’usine et à la sécurité des personnes. Compte tenu des coûts, il est judicieux d’établir un bon équilibre entre entretien préventif systématique et entretien correctif. La surveillance des installations concourt à limiter le niveau d’entretien préventif. Dans ce contexte, l’analyse vibratoire constitue un outil de détection puis de diagnostic de défauts de fonctionnement des installations. Aussi, après avoir décrit les principales manifestations vibratoires des défauts de fonctionnement des machines, nous allons examiner les stratégies de détection et de surveillance dans le domaine temporel et fréquentiel et la démarche de diagnostic en nous appuyant sur l’intelligence artificielle et en analysant les signaux vibratoires permettant de déduire une politique de gestion de la maintenance. Notre objectif principal est de réaliser un système permettant d’assurer l’analyser les signaux vibratoires d’une machine tournante dans le domaine temps/fréquence. Il sera ensuite aisé de le comparer avec un système d’apprentissage automatique capable de détecter et classer les défauts grâce à des algorithmes d’intelligence artificielle. L’application vise à fournir un système de détection de défauts fiable afin de réduire les temps de dépannages et favoriser un diagnostic rapide des pannes des systèmes industriels.

Ensuite, nous avons mis en place un système de surveillance de l’état de cette machine en fixant un seuil pour le bon fonctionnement et un autre pour déclencher une alarme quand ce dernier est atteint. Dans un second temps, nous avons utilisé des algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique (ou machine learning) pour classer les différents niveaux de défaillance. Après extraction des caractéristiques des signaux dans le domaine temporel et fréquentiel nous avons obtenu une fiabilité de 99.3% avec la méthode d’estimation dite « validation croisée » (en anglais cross-validation).

The internet of industrial objects (IIoT) is part of a larger concept known as the ""Internet of Things (IoT)"". IoT's bring new opportunities to production sites such as lower operating costs and increased productivity for optimal operation. The application of IoT to the manufacturing industry is called IIoT (or Industrial Internet or Industry 4.0). The IoT will revolutionize manufacturing by enabling the acquisition and accessibility of massive amounts of data at much higher speeds and far more efficiently than before. A few innovative companies have started to implement IoT by exploiting smart connected devices in their factories (so-called smart factories or Industry 4.0). From a data acquisition perspective, the Internet of Things has favoured the inclusion of subsystems and their analysis in real time. To achieve this, Industry 4.0 introduces a digitized production concept by allowing flexible and agile integration of new business models while keeping manufacturing costs and efficiency at a reasonable level. In this thesis, we will study the predictive maintenance for industry 4.0. This method of preventing asset failure by analyzing production data to identify patterns and predict issues before they happen. However, considering the costs, it is wise to strike a better balance between routine preventative maintenance and corrective maintenance. Facility monitoring helps to reduce the level of preventative maintenance. In this context, vibration analysis is a tool for detecting and then diagnosing malfunctions of installations. Also, after describing the main vibratory manifestations of failures of the machines, we will examine the detection and surveillance strategies at the time and frequency domain and the diagnosis process based on artificial intelligence by analyzing the vibratory signals. Our main objective is to design a system that will analyze the vibrating signals of a rotating machine in the time/frequency domain. A machine learning system will be used to detect and classify the defects based on artificial intelligence algorithms. The application aims to provide a reliable fault detection system to reduce repair times and promote rapid diagnosis of industrial operations. Therefore, the project goes from the design to the implementation of new algorithms using vibratory signals. An optimization process will be implemented when the decisions of the adequate staff are made to increase the efficiency of the results and reduce the risk situations that will put the machines out of use. Therefore, this research project will introduce an intelligent system into an industry 4.0 production environment. During this research project, firstly, we will implement algorithms that allowed us to extract characteristics of the vibration signals and set up a system to monitor the state of a rotating machine by setting a threshold of operation and trigger an alarm when this threshold is reached. In a second step, we will use signal processing and machine learning toolkits to classify the different levels of machine failure and use this method to detect the presence of error when the machine is running. After extracting the characteristics of our signals at the time and frequency domain, we will be obtained with the ""cross-validation"" a recognition rate of 99.3%. The final implementation with the ""holdout validation"" recommended for large datasets allowed us to have a classification rate of 100% of the different levels of defects considered",multimedia,917,not included

Moreover, the similarity of color also poses a challenge in segmentation. In
this article, we propose to divide the pose estimation process into three

convolutional neural network was utilized to perform object detection.
Concerning the reliability of surface texture, we leveraged the contour

inapplicable to clustered metal parts due to the difficulties in segmentation,
we use the dense discrete points along the metal part edges as semantic

Le perchage de drone, étroitement lié à ces tâches, commence également à se développer. Cette faculté permettrait aux drones de réaliser de nouvelles tâches mais aussi de combler leurs inconvénients tels que leur faible durée de vol ou le fait qu'ils soient fragiles. Par exemple, cela assurerait à un drone de se poser en cas de fin de batterie ou de mauvaises conditions climatiques. Les techniques actuelles de perchage ou de saisie d'objet effectuées à partir de la vision artificielle et d'un système de préhension ajouté au drone, se basent seulement sur la détection d'objets. Les objets/supports, lors des tests, sont sélectionnés en avance par les chercheurs afin d'avoir une bonne concordance avec le préhenseur. Ainsi, dans le cas où le support possède une forme complexe ou encore des dimensions trop différentes par rapport à celles du préhenseur, le drone le détectera et essayera de s'y percher sans succès. L'objectif de cette maîtrise recherche est de développer un système de détection d'objets, par vision par ordinateur, qui selon les caractéristiques du préhenseur du drone, détecte les objets, leur attribue un score de concordance et renvoie le support idéal. Le score de concordance, que nous avons établi et nommé ""CSP"" (Concordance Support-Préhenseur) dans ce mémoire, se détermine à partir de la comparaison entre l'intervalle d'ouverture du préhenseur et les dimensions réelles des objets. La réalisation d'une comparaison ainsi que l'utilisation d'un score de concordance pour la détermination d'un support adéquat est une procédure que nous avons élaborée. Partant d'un algorithme de détection basé sur la classification et la segmentation des objets détectés, la solution proposée dans ce mémoire a été développée en 3 phases : 1. Entrainement supervisé du réseau de neurones de l'algorithme de détection pour de nouvelles classes d'objets adaptées au perchage de drone. 2. Conception d'un algorithme, permettant de réaliser une comparaison entre les dimensions des objets détectés et celles du système de préhension dans le but de déterminer le support idéal pour le perchage du drone. 3. Évaluation des performances du modèle de détection complet, regroupant les deux algorithmes, à partir de tests réalisés sur un ensemble d'objets avec des paramètres et des conditions d'environnement différents entre chaque test. Cette évaluation a démontré la précision et la fiabilité de notre système dans la détermination du support idéal à partir de la vision artificielle. Nous avons effectué un ensemble de 36 tests avec pour chaque test un paramétrage différent. De plus, chaque test a été effectué avec un nombre de 10 répétitions soit avec une configuration des paramètres identique dans le but d'avoir des résultats plus fiables. Ces tests ont été réalisés avec une caméra ayant une résolution 640 x 480 et une carte graphique GTX 1080Ti (GPU). La performance globale de notre système obtient un taux de succès de 84.17 % dans la détermination du support idéal. Ce taux de succès atteint même les 100 % dans le cas d'une différence de diamètre d'au moins 20 mm entre les objets détectés. La vitesse d'exécution du modèle, dans le cas d'un seul objet détecté par image, prend en moyenne 0.42 seconde pour l'analyse d'une image, ce qui correspond à 2.38 fps. Le fait d'obtenir un temps d'exécution efficace dans le traitement de chaque objet permet ainsi de garder une fluidité dans la détection lors du déplacement de la caméra et ainsi d'éviter les mauvaises détections et/ou mauvaises segmentations.----------ABSTRACT The use of artificial vision and artificial intelligence in drones applications is experiencing rapid growth, particularly in pick and drop applications but also in drone landing.

This research would allow the drones to realize new tasks but also to mitigate their disadvantages such as their short flight time or their fragility. Current perching and object grasping approaches are carried out by utilizing artificial vision and robotic grippers integrated with the drones. The target objects or their handles are chosen in a way to match the geometry of the gripper. Thus, in case where supports have complex form or dimensions too differents in comparison with gripper dimensions, perching won't be avaiblable. The purpose of this study is to develop a detection system that uses computer vision to return ideal support for drone perching. The ideal support corresponds to the object with the best matching score. The matching score, that we have developed and called ""CSP"" (Concordance Support-Préhenseur) in this study, is determined from the comparison between the gripper opening and the real object dimension. The implementation of this comparison as well as the utilization of matching score to the determination of the best support is a method that we created. The suggested solution in this study is based on a detection algorithm which uses the classification and segmentation of objects. The several stages of the uses method are enumerated as follows : 1. Supervised training of neural network detection algorithm for new objects classes adapted to drone perching. 2. Conception of an algorithm, allowing to realize a comparison between object dimensions and grasping system dimensions in order to determine the ideal support. 3. Evaluation of the global system performances thanks to tests performed on a set of objects. This evaluation has shown the precision and the reliability of our system in the ideal support determination based on artificial vision. We used a set of 36 tests with, for each test, different parameter values and different environmental conditions. Moreover, each test has been performed with a number of 10 repetitions for a given configuration in the purpose to obtain more reliable results. These tests have been made using a camera with a resolution of 640 x 480 and a graphic processor unit GTX 1080Ti (GPU). The global performance of our system obtains a success rate of 84.17 % in the ideal support determination. This success rate even reaches 100 % in the case where the difference between the diameter of each object is at least 20 mm. The execution speed of this model, with only one detected object by image, takes on average 0.42 second for the analysis of one image, which corresponds to 2.38 fps. To maintain fluidity and thus to avoid wrong detections and/or segmentations during camera motion, an efficient execution time is needed in the treatment of each object",multimedia,931,not included

One area of all games which is critical to the success of the game is that of game balance and tuning. These balancing initiatives cut across all areas of code from the player and AI to the mission manager. In computer science, we’ve come to call these types of concerns “cross cutting”. Aspect oriented programming was developed, in part, to solve the problems of cross cutting: employing “advice” which can be incorporated across different pieces of functionality.
Yet, despite the prevalence of a solution, very little work has been done to bring cross cutting to game engine programming. Additionally, the discipline involves a heavy amount of code rewriting and reuse while simultaneously relying on many common design patterns that are copied from one project to another. In the case of game balance, the code may be wildly different across two different games despite the fact that similar tasks are being done. These two problems are exacerbated by the fact that almost every game engine has its own custom DSL (domain specific language) unique to that situation. If a DSL could showcase the areas of cross cutting concerns while highlighting the ability to capture design patterns that can be used across games, significant productivity savings could be achieved while simultaneously creating a common thread for discussion of shared problems within the domain.
This dissertation sought to do exactly that- create a metalanguage called GAMESPECT which supports multiple styles of DSLs while bringing aspect-oriented programming into the DSL’s to make them DSAL (domain specific aspect languages). The example cross cutting concern was game balance and tuning since it’s so pervasive and important to gaming. We have created GAMESPECT as a language and a composition framework which can assist engine developers and game designers in balancing their games, forming one central place for game balancing concerns even while these concerns may cross different languages and locations inside the source code. Generality was measured by showcasing the composition specifications in multiple contexts and languages.
In addition to evaluating generality and performance metrics, effectiveness was be measured. Specifically, comparisons were made between a balancing initiative when performed with GAMESPECT vs a traditional methodology. In doing so, this work shows a clear advantage to using a Metalanguage such as GAMESPECT for this task. In general, a line of code reduction of 9-40% per task was achieved with negligible effects to performance. The use of a metalanguage in Unreal Engine 4 is a starting point to further discussions concerning other game engines. In addition, this work has implications beyond video game programming. The work described highlights benefits which might be achieved in other disciplines where design pattern implementations and cross-cutting concern usage is high; the real time simulation field and the field of Windows GUI programming are two examples of future domains",multimedia,932,not included
,to_check,core,'Wiley',01/01/2018 00:00,core,towards robust and domain invariant feature representations in deep learning,10.13016/M2MK65C49,"A fundamental problem in perception-based systems is to define

and learn representations of the scene that are more robust and adaptive to several nuisance

factors. Over the recent past, for a variety of tasks involving images, learned representations  have been empirically shown to outperform handcrafted ones.

However, their inability to generalize across varying data distributions poses the following

question: Do representations learned using deep networks just fit a given data distribution or do

they sufficiently model the underlying structure of the problem ? This question could be

understood using a simple example: If a learning algorithm is shown a number of images of a simple handwritten digit, then the representation learned should be generic enough to identify the same digit in

a different form. With regards to deep networks, although the learned representation has been shown

to be robust to various forms of synthetic distortions such as random noise, they fail in the presence of

more implicit forms of naturally occurring distortions. In this dissertation, we

propose approaches to mitigate the effect of such distortions and in the process, study some

vulnerabilities of deep networks to small imperceptible changes that occur in the given input.

The research problems that comprise this dissertation lie in the cross section of two open topics: (1)

Studying and developing methods that enable neural networks learn robust representations (2) Improving

generalization of neural nets across domains.  The first part of the dissertation  approaches the problem of robustness from two broad viewpoints:  Robustness to external nuisance factors that occur in the data and robustness

(or a lack thereof) to perturbations of the learned feature space.  In the second part, we focus on learning representations that are invariant to external covariate

shift, which is more commonly termed as domain shift. 

Towards learning representations robust

to external nuisance factors, we propose an approach that couples a deep convolutional neural

network with a low-dimensional discriminative embedding learned using triplet probability

constraints to solve the unconstrained face analysis problem. While previous approaches in this area have proposed scalable yet ad-hoc solutions to this problem, we propose a principled and parameter free formulation which is based on maximum likelihood estimation. In addition, we employ the principle of transfer learning to realize a deep network architecture that can train faster and on lesser data yet significantly outperforms existing approaches on the unconstrained face verification task. We demonstrate the robustness

of the approach to challenges including age, pose, blur and clutter by performing clustering

experiments on challenging benchmarks.

Recent seminal works have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to visually imperceptible perturbations of the input. In this dissertation, we build on their ideas in two unique ways: (a) We show that neural networks that perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation tasks also suffer from this vulnerability, despite being trained with more extra information compares to simple classification tasks.  In addition, we present a novel self correcting mechanism in segmentation networks and provide an efficient way to generate such perturbations (b) We present a novel approach to regularize deep neural networks by perturbing intermediate layer activations in an efficient manner, thereby exploring the trade-off between conventional regularization and adversarial robustness within the context of very deep networks. Both of these works provide interesting directions towards understanding the secure nature of deep learning algorithms. 

While humans find it extremely simple to generalize their knowledge across domains, machine learning algorithms including deep neural networks suffer from the problem of domain shift across what are commonly termed as 'source' (S) 

and 'target' (T) distributions. Let the data that a learning algorithm

is trained on be sampled from  S. If the real data used to evaluate the model is

then sampled from T, then the learnt model under-performs on the target data. This inability to generalize is characterized as domain shift. 

Our attempt to address this problem involves learning a common

feature subspace, where distance between source and target distributions are minimized. Estimating the distance between different domains is highly non-trivial and is an open research

problem in itself. In our approach we parameterize the distance measure by using a Generative

Adversarial Network (GAN). A GAN involves a two player game between two mappings com-

monly termed as generator and discriminator. These mappings are learned simultaneously by

employing an adversarial game, i.e. by letting the generator fool the discriminator and enabling

the discriminator to outperform the generator. This adversarial game can be formulated as a

minimax problem. In our approach, we learn three mappings simultaneously: the generator,

discriminator and a feature mapping that contains information about both the content and the

domain of the input. We deploy a two-level minimax game, where the first level is a competition

between the generator and a discriminator similar to a GAN; the second level game is where the

feature mapping attempts to fool the discriminator thereby introducing domain invariance in

the learned feature representation. We have extensively evaluated this approach for different

tasks such as object classification and semantic segmentation, where we achieve state of the

art results across several real datasets. In addition to the conceptual novelty, our approach

presents a more efficient and scalable solution compared to other approaches that attempt to

solve the same problem.

In the final part of this dissertation, we describe some ongoing efforts and future directions of research. Inspired from the study of perturbations described above, we propose a novel metric on how to effectively choose pixels to label given an image, for a pixel-wise segmentation task. This has the potential to significantly reduce the labeling effort and our preliminary results for the task of semantic segmentation are encouraging.  While the domain adaptation approach proposed above considered static images, we propose an extension to video data aided by the use of recurrent neural networks.  Use of full temporal information, when available, provides the perceptual system additional context to disambiguate among smaller object classes  that commonly occur in real scenes",multimedia,933,not included

Furthermore, recent ensemble, bootstrap and dropout methods for quantifying neural network uncertainty may not efficiently provide accurate uncertainty estimates when queried  with  inputs  that  are  very  different  from  their  training data. Rather than unconditionally trusting the predictions of a neural network for unpredictable real-world data, we use an autoencoder  to recognize when a query is novel, and revert to a safe prior behavior.

Esse índice, denominado nível normalizado de exposição não contínua, possibilitará a implantação de medidas mais efetivas na prevenção de danos auditivos associados ao ruído e um tratamento mais acertado que o atual em relação aos benefícios legais para certas categorias profissionais, como carpinteiros, armadores, pedreiros etc. O método proposto baseou-se no princípio de igual energia. Segundo esse princípio, a energia sonora é a única responsável pelo desenvolvimento das perdas auditivas induzidas pelo ruído (PAIRs) em uma população exposta ao ruído. Esse pressuposto, já adotado pela norma internacional ISO 1999 (1990), permitiu o estabelecimento de uma relação estatística entre a exposição contínua e as perdas auditivas induzidas pelo ruído.

The application of this method results in a representative index of the actual exposure to the occupational noise of workers whose activities present a great variation of the average noise levels when computed on a daily basis. This index shall, named normalized level of noncontinuous exposure, enable the implementation of more effective actions in the prevention of auditory damages associated to noise and a more accurate treatment than the current one in relation to the legal benefits for certain professional categories, such as carpenters, undertaker, masons, etc. The proposed method is based on the principle of equivalent energy. According to this principle, the sound energy is the only responsible for the development of auditory damages induced by noise (PAIRs) in a population exposed to noise, so that the type of noise and its daily duration do not interfere in the auditory damage process. This assumption, already adopted by the international standard ISO 1999 (1990), allowed the establishment of a statistical relation between the continuous exposure and the auditory damages caused by noise. ln this work, using other assumptions, the principle of equal energy for noncontinuous exposures is included, allowing the estimates of auditory damages also caused in environments with great variation of sound levels. The results of the proposed method are related by the effectiveness of causing auditory damages, that is, the damages caused by the noise originated from noncontinuous exposure are expressed herein by a normalized exposure level (NEN) of continuous exposure. In this work the proposed method on two groups of professionals in the Civil Construction is also applied: general assistants and carpenters, for whom the exposure to noise was evaluated and the distribution of  PAIRs was determined.

If we see a single object or hear a particular sound, we are then able to recognize such sample or even different versions of it in other scenarios. As an example, if one sees a iron chair and associates the object to the general concept of “chairs”, he will be able to detect and recognize also wooden or wicker chairs. Similarly, when we hear the sound of a particular event, such as a scream, we are then able to recognize other kinds of scream that occur in different environments. We continuously learn representations of the real world, which we then use in order to understand new and changing environments.In the field of pattern recognition, traditional methods typically require a careful design of data representations (i.e. features), which involves considerable domain knowledge and effort by experts. Recently, approaches for automated learning of representations from training data were introduced and based on popular deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Representation learning aims at avoiding engineering of hand-crafted features and providing automatically learned features suitable for the recognition tasks. In this work, we proposed novel trainable filters for representation learning in audio and image processing. The structure of these filters is not fixed in the implementation but rather configured directly from single prototype patterns of interest [4].In the context of audio processing, we focused on the problem of audio event detection and classification in noisy environments, also in cases where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is null or negative. We released two data sets, namely the MIVIA audio events and the MIVIA road events data sets, and obtained baseline results (recognition rate of about 85%) with a real-time method for event detection based on the bag of features classification scheme [3, 2].We designed novel trainable feature extractors, which we call COPE (Combination of Peaks of Energy), that are able to detect specific constellations of energy peak points in time-frequency representations of input audio signals [8]. The particular constellation of energy peaks to be detected by a COPE feature extractor is determined in an automatic configuration process performed on a given prototype sound. The design of COPE feature extractors was inspired by some functions of the cochlea membrane and the inner hair cells in the inner auditory system, which convert the sound pressure waves into neural stimuli on the auditory nerve.We proposed a method that uses COPE feature extractors together with a classification system to perform real-time audio event detection and classification, also in cases where sounds have null and negative SNR. The performance results (recognition rate over 90%) that we obtained on several benchmarking data sets for audio events detection in different contexts are higher than state-of-the-art approaches.In the second part of the work, we introduced B-COSFIRE filters for detection of elongated and curvilinear patterns in images and apply them to the delineation of blood vessels in retinal images [1, 6]. The B-COSFIRE filters are trainable, that is their structure is automatically configured from prototype elongated patterns. The design of the B-COSFIRE filters is inspired by the functions of some neurons, called simple cells, in area V1 of the visual system, which fire when presented with line or contour stimuli. A B-COSFIRE filter achieves orientation selectivity by computing the weighted geometric mean of the output of a pool of Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filters, whose supports are aligned in a collinear manner. Rotation invariance is efficiently obtained by appropriate shiftings of the DoG filter responses.After configuring a large bank of B-COSFIRE filters selective for vessels (i.e. lines) and vessel-endings (i.e. line-endings) of various thickness (i.e. scale), we employed different techniques based on information theory and machine learning to select an optimal subset of B-COSFIRE filters for the vessel delineation task [5, 7]. We considered the selected filters as feature extractors to construct a pixel-wise feature vector which we used in combination with a classifier to classify the pixels in the testing image as vessel and non-vessel pixels. We carried out experiments on public benchmarking data sets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE DB1 and HRF data sets) and the results that we achieved are higher than many existing methods.We studied the computational requirements of the proposed algorithms in order to evaluate their applicabilityin real-world applications and the fulfillment of real-time constraints given by the considered problems. The MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithms are publicly released for research purposes.This work contributes to the development of algorithms for representation learning in audio and imageprocessing and promotes their use in higher-level pattern recognition systems",multimedia,939,not included

Ces simulateurs doivent recréer des scénarios de vol permettant d’exécuter des itinéraires réguliers de vol ou de confronter les pilotes à différentes situations d’urgence qui peuvent subvenir lors d’un vrai vol (p. ex., une tempête violente). Puisque les simulateurs de vol ont un impact direct sur la qualité de formation des pilotes, une batterie exhaustive de tests s’impose à chaque fois qu’une nouvelle version d’un simulateur doit être mise en opération. Une bonne partie de ces tests requièrent l’intervention d’un pilote qui stimule le système en réalisant une série d’opérations de contrôle provenant de scénarios de vol préparés par des experts en aéronautique, ce qui est gourmand en temps, en ressources humaines et en ressources financières. La raison de la nécessité de réaliser tous ces tests est que le logiciel en soit est constitué de plusieurs composants de type boîte noire dont le code source n’est pas disponible, ils sont fournis tels quels par les fournisseurs du composant réel d’origine devant être simulé (p. ex., un composant hydraulique d’un aéronef que nous voulons simuler). Puisque nous n’avons pas pas accès au code source, il n’est pas possible lors de la mise-à-jour de l’un de ces composants de savoir quel sera le changement dans le comportement du simulateur. Dans le meilleur des cas, un défaut dans un composant aura un impact local et, dans le pire des cas, il peut nuire à tous les autres composants du simulateur. Il est dans ce cas nécessaire d’utiliser une stratégie de test d’une large granularité couvrant à la fois le fonctionnement des composants eux-mêmes et l’ensemble des fonctionnalités de vol du simulateur afin d’en assurer sa qualité. Dans le cadre de ces tests, afin de réduire le temps requis pour vérifier le bon comportement d’une nouvelle version d’un simulateur, nous proposons dans ce mémoire d’automatiser l’analyse des résultats de test en modélisant le comportement normal du système logiciel en utilisant de l’apprentissage automatique. Un tel modèle tente de recréer le comportement stable du système en bâtissant des règles reliant ses entrées à chacune de ses sorties. Les entrées sont constituées de métriques provenant des contrôles qui stimulent le système et les sorties sont constituées de métriques que nous pouvons observer. Nous produisons donc un modèle initial d’une version fiable du simulateur et nous validons par la suite le bon comportement des versions subséquentes en comparant leur comportement avec celui du modèle initial. Nous cherchons à voir s’il y a un écart trop important avec le modèle initial, ce nous considérons comme étant une déviation. Le but final de notre recherche est de pouvoir appliquer notre méthodologie d’analyse des résultats de test dans l’industrie de la simulation. Afin d’avoir plus de flexibilité dans nos expérimentations, nous commençons d’abord par valider l’approche avec un simulateur plus simple et ouvert. Nous utilisons donc le simulateur de vol à source libre FlightGear comme cas d’étude pour évaluer notre approche de test. Ce simulateur utilise l’engin de vol très populaire JSBsim et la librairie SimGear pour modéliser les aéronefs et simuler leur comportement dynamique dans un environnement de vol. JSBsim est notamment utilisé par la Nasa à des fins de recherche. Nous réalisons d’abord un vol manuel en utilisant des périphériques de contrôle d’un ordinateur tout en enregistrant les données contenues dans le simulateur. Le vol doit être composé de toutes les opérations régulières de pilotage afin que le modèle que l’on en extrait représente fidèlement le comportement normal du simulateur. Nous réalisons par la suite plusieurs répétitions du même vol afin d’identifier des niveaux de seuils robustes pour déterminer au delà de quels écarts un métrique d’une nouvelle version doit être considéré comme déviant par rapport au modèle. Nous élaborons à cet effet cinq scénarios de mutation du comportement de la version initiale de notre simulateur afin de générer différentes versions ayant des métriques qui respectent le comportement normal du système ou présentant une déviation du comportement normal reliée à un problème fonctionnel. En sachant d’avance quelles mutations présentent des déviations et avec l’aide d’experts identifiant précisément les métriques qui dévient de leur comportement normal, nous pouvons construire un oracle avec lequel nous évaluons la précision et le rappel de notre approche de détection. En particulier, dans le cadre de notre étude empirique sur FlightGear, nous modifions une version initiale du simulateur en y injectant cinq différentes mutations qui n’ont pas d’impact grave ou qui engendrent des problème fonctionnels avec lesquels nous évaluons notre approche. Les résultats montrent qu’en choisissant des niveaux de seuil initiaux lors d’une première calibration, notre approche peut détecter les métriques ayant des déviations avec un rappel majoritairement de 100% (un seul cas de mutation à 50%) et une précision d’au moins 40%. En ce qui a trait aux mutations ne changeant pas le comportement normal du simulateur, notre approche a un taux de fausses alarmes de 60%. Nous montrons également qu’avec une base de données plus large, il est possible de calibrer notre approche afin d’améliorer sa performance. Avec des niveaux de seuil optimaux qui sont calibrés pour chacune des mutations, nous obtenons un taux de rappel de 100% pour tous les cas, une précision d’au moins 50% pour les versions ayant des problèmes fonctionnels et un taux de fausses alarmes de 0% pour les versions n’ayant pas de problèmes fonctionnels. Afin d’ouvrir la voie pour des améliorations futures, nous utilisons notre méthodologie pour faire une petite expérimentation connexe sur JSBsim afin de détecter les déviations dans les transitions entre les états stables de chacun des métriques. Nous utilisons la même modélisation du simulateur. Les résultats montrent que nous pouvons battre une classification aléatoire des déviations. Cette nouvelle approche n’en n’est qu’à ces débuts et nous sommes convaincu que nous pouvons obtenir des résultats plus significatifs avec de futurs travaux sur le sujet. Nous proposons également dans les améliorations futures de descendre le niveau de granularité de notre modélisation du simulateur au niveau de chacun de ses composants. Cela permettrait d’isoler exactement qu’elle composant présente une déviation, et ainsi trouver la source du problème.----------ABSTRACT Flight simulators are systems composed of software and mechanical actuators used to train crews for real flights. The software is emulating flight dynamics and control systems using components off-the-shelf developed by third parties. For each new version of these components, we do not know what parts of the system is impacted by the change and hence how the change would impact the behaviour of the entire simulator. Hence, given the safety critical nature of flight simulators, an exhaustive set of manual system tests must be performed by a professional pilot. Test experts then rely on the test pilot’s feedback and on the analysis of output metrics to assess the correctness of a simulator’s behaviour, which consumes time and money, even more these tests must be repeated each time one of the components is updated by its vendor. To automate the analysis of test results from new simulator versions, we propose a machine learning-based approach that first builds a model that mimics the normal behaviour of a simulator by creating rules between its input and output metrics, where input metrics are control data stimulating the system and output metrics are data used to assess the behaviour of the system. We then build a behavioural model of the last-known correctly behaving version of the simulator, to which we compare data from new versions to detect metric deviations. The goal of our research is to first build a model of the simulator, then detect deviations of new simulator versions using that model, and finally develop an automatic approach to flag deviations when there are functional problems. Our case study uses the open-source flight simulator Flight Gear, based on the well-known JSBsim flight dynamic engine currently used by the Nasa. Applying our approach, we first drive a manual basic flight using computer peripherals while recording metrics in the simulator. We then use the recorded metrics to build a model of this basic execution scenario. After repeating several times our flight we have enough data to identify robust metric deviation thresholds to determine when a metric in a new version is deviating too far from the model. We generate five different versions of FlightGear by injecting harmless and harmful modifications into the the simulator, then perform again our initial flight multiple times for each of those versions while recording input and output metrics. We rely on experts identifying which output metric should be deviating in each scenario to build an oracle. Using an initial threshold, our approach can detect most of the deviations in problematic versions with a near perfect recall (only one case at 50%) and a reasonable precision of at least 40%. For the versions without harmfull deviations we get a false alarm rate of 60%. By optimizing the threshold for each version, we get a perfect recall of 100%, a precision of at least 50%, and a false alarm rate of 0% for the good behaving versions. To open the path for future work, we perform a case study on JSBsim using a variant of our basic deviation detection approach to detect transient deviations using the same model. Our results show that we can beat a random classification for one kind of deviation, however for other deviations our models do not perform as well. This new approach is just a first step towards transient deviation detection, and we are convinced that we can get better results in future work. We also propose to use finer-grained models for each component to be able to isolate the exact component causing a functional problem",multimedia,945,not included

The aforementioned programs and initiatives make use of satellite-based rapid mapping services aimed at delivering reliable and accurate crisis information after natural hazards.

Although these services are increasingly operational, they need to be continuously updated and improved through research and development (R&D) activities. The principal objective of ASAPTERRA (Advancing SAR and Optical Methods for Rapid Mapping), the ESA-funded R&D project being described here, is to improve, automate and, hence, speed-up geo-information extraction procedures in the context of natural hazards response. This is performed through the development, implementation, testing and validation of novel image processing methods using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The methods are mainly developed based on data of the German radar satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, the French satellite missions Pléiades-1A/1B as well as the ESA missions Sentinel-1/2 with the aim to better characterize the potential and limitations of these sensors and their synergy. The resulting algorithms and techniques are evaluated in real case applications during rapid mapping activities. 

The project is focussed on three types of natural hazards: floods, landslides and fires. Within this presentation an overview of the main methodological developments in each topic is given and demonstrated in selected test areas. The following developments are presented in the context of flood mapping: a fully automated Sentinel-1 based processing chain for detecting open flood surfaces, a method for the improved detection of flooded vegetation in Sentinel-1data using Entropy/Alpha decomposition, unsupervised Wishart Classification, and object-based post-classification as well as semi-automatic approaches for extracting inundated areas and flood traces in rural and urban areas from VHR and HR optical imagery using machine learning techniques. Methodological developments related to fires are the implementation of fast and robust methods for mapping burnt scars using change detection procedures using SAR (Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X) and HR optical (e.g. SPOT, Sentinel-2) data as well as the extraction of 3D surface and volume change information from Pléiades stereo-pairs. In the context of landslides, fast and transferable change detection procedures based on SAR (TerraSAR-X) and optical (SPOT) data as well methods for extracting the extent of landslides only based on polarimetric VHR SAR (TerraSAR-X) data are presented",multimedia,946,not included

Au cours des dernières années, le système scolaire québécois impose une pression croissante sur les 
enseignants. En effet, ceux-ci doivent gérer des classes de plus en plus nombreuses tout en maintenant un soutien adéquat à l’apprentissage des élèves. Dans ce contexte, l’utilisation de systèmes tutoriels intelligents qui sont en mesure d’assister l’enseignant dans son travail 
pourrait permettre à ce dernier de consacrer plus de temps aux élèves qui en ont véritablement besoin. Malheureusement, dans le domaine de l’enseignement des preuves en géométrie, l’offre de systèmes tutoriels est limitée. De plus, ceux actuellement proposés forcent l’élève à travailler selon un ordre déterminé et ils ne fournissent pas de soutien dans le cadre d’une exploration libre du problème. Ils l’obligent aussi à rédiger des preuves formelles qui ne sont pas adaptées aux exigences des enseignants du secondaire.
Partant de ce constat, nous avons établi l’objectif principal de notre projet qui consiste à proposer un système tutoriel intelligent qui assiste l’élève dans une démarche d’exploration plutôt que de rédaction dans le cadre de l’élaboration d’une preuve en géométrie. Dans le but de l’atteindre, nous proposons le système QED-Tutrix qui a été conçu à la suite d’une analyse des 
interventions d’enseignants réels observés. Il permet à l’enseignant ou au didacticien de construire un ensemble de preuves acceptables pour un problème donné en fonction de l’objectif d’apprentissage visé. L’élève peut ensuite tenter de résoudre le problème choisi par l’enseignant 
en utilisant les différents outils offerts à l’interface de QED-Tutrix. Celui-ci a accès à une figure dynamique afin de découvrir des conjectures, à un répertoire d’énoncés pour composer sa preuve et à une démonstration qu’il doit compléter. Tous les énoncés proposés sont analysés par le 
système qui génère des rétroactions à l’intérieur d’une fenêtre de clavardage afin de guider l’élève lors de l’exploration et de la résolution du problème.
L’élaboration de QED-Tutrix a été réalisée par une équipe multidisciplinaire composée d’experts en didactique et en informatique. Le système a été construit itérativement par la mise en oeuvre du paradigme de la conception dans l’usage qui est constitué d’une succession de plusieurs cycles de recherche et de développement. Chaque cycle se clôture par une expé- rimentation qui vise à valider 
le travail accompli et à recueillir des informations qui sont réinvesties dans le cycle suivant. 
Une première version du système (GeoGebraTUTOR) a donc été créée afin d’étudier notamment les interventions d’enseignants réels qui ont inspiré l’élaboration de la seconde version (QED-Tutrix), qui est décrite et analysée dans cette thèse.
Nous ne prétendons pas que la version actuelle du système a un effet mesurable sur les résultats scolaires, car nous visons, pour l’instant, à permettre à un élève de travailler en conformité avec des théories didactiques reconnues. En effet, la conception de QED-Tutrix s’ancre 
principalement dans la théorie des situations didactiques qui permet de représenter une situation didactique par une relation élève-milieu. Nous utilisons cependant une version étendue de cette théorie dans laquelle un agent tutoriel, qui joue le rôle d’un enseignant virtuel, peut agir sur la 
relation élève-milieu. De plus, nous désirons offrir un système tutoriel qui est un véritable espace de travail géométrique, c’est-à-dire qu’il permet à l’élève de résoudre des problèmes en mettant en oeuvre les trois démarches définies dans cet espace.
Ces théories didactiques ainsi que les résultats de nos observations ont été implantés dans QED-Tutrix. Il en est résulté un système comportant quatre couches logicielles principales. La première permet de modéliser l’ensemble des démonstrations possibles pour résoudre un problème 
donné. Pour chaque problème, l’enseignant inscrit toutes les inférences, ou pas de démonstration, qui sont acceptables pour sa résolution selon l’objectif d’apprentissage visé. Chaque inférence contient une justification qui est utilisée pour produire un conséquent à partir de l’ensemble de ses antécédents. Il est possible de les combiner afin d’obtenir un graphe contenant toutes les solutions valides, car les conséquents peuvent être recyclés pour former les antécédents d’autres inférences. Le parcours du graphe contenu dans cette première couche permet donc d’énumérer les différentes solutions au problème représenté.
Afin de proposer une aide qui respecte l’état cognitif de l’élève lors de l’exploration d’un problème, il est essentiel de conserver la chronologie de ses actions. Nous l’avons donc modélisée à l’intérieur de la deuxième couche de notre système. Celle-ci contient des données dynamiques qui sont mises à jour au cours de la résolution d’un problème, à l’opposé du graphe qui est statique, et elle se superpose à ce dernier. En effet, nous indiquons, pour chaque noeud du graphe, le temps d’activation le plus récent qui correspond à l’écriture de l’énoncé qui lui est attaché. Cette approche se démarque de celle des autres systèmes, car ces derniers n’utilisent pas la chronologie 
des actions, étant donné qu’ils imposent une séquence de résolution.
Pour être en mesure de suggérer différentes pistes de solution à un élève bloqué dans son processus de résolution, nous avons choisi de traiter les inférences selon un ordre de priorité. Ce classement est réalisé par la troisième couche de QED-Tutrix, qui utilise les données des deux couches précédentes. Pour l’obtenir, nous recherchons d’abord la solution la plus avancée à l’aide 
d’une heuristique originale, que nous avons élaborée et qui permet d’éviter d’énumérer toutes les solutions. Nous affectons ensuite des priorités plus élevées aux inférences faisant partie de la solution déterminée et qui ont été travaillées récemment par l’élève, afin de respecter son état cognitif. La proposition d’autres pistes nous démarque des systèmes tutoriels traditionnels qui offrent de l’aide uniquement pour compléter une solution optimale.
La liste ordonnée d’inférences est utilisée par la dernière couche du système, soit celle qui produit les différentes rétroactions. Premièrement, QED-Tutrix offre des rétroactions instantanées, en réponse à l’écriture de chaque énoncé, sous forme d’émoticônes et de messages courts. Il permet aussi d’encoder des erreurs courantes afin de leur associer des messages précis. Il offre 
enfin une aide à la prochaine étape qui est inspirée des interventions des enseignants réels observés. Cette dernière forme d’aide a été modélisée par une machine à états finis qui traite séquentiellement les inférences ordonnées dans la liste et produit une série d’indices permettant de les compléter. Des messages doivent être composés pour cha- cune des inférences, mais des 
mécanismes ont été implantés afin de réduire leur nombre. Les rétroactions offertes sont comparables à celles d’autres systèmes tutoriels.
Environ 450 inférences ont été produites et près de 900 messages composés afin d’implanter les cinq problèmes actuellement offerts dans notre système. Son fonctionnement a d’abord été vérifié par un expert indépendant. Celui-ci a confirmé que les messages produits étaient conformes à la structure déterminée, mais que l’évaluation de la solution la plus avancée était parfois problématique. 
QED-Tutrix a ensuite été utilisé par des élèves de 4e secondaire. Ceux-ci ont généralement trouvé le système utile et ont apprécié l’expérience. L’analyse des enregistrements nous a permis de constater que la structure des messages générée permet d’ai- der certains élèves. De plus, nous avons observé la mise en oeuvre des différentes démarches, ce qui confirme le statut d’espace de travail géométrique de QED-Tutrix. L’efficacité de ce dernier est, par contre, limitée dans le cas d’élèves plus faibles, car la structure des messages est calibrée afin d’aider des élèves moyens. Le problème concernant l’évaluation de la solution la plus avancée a aussi provoqué la production 
de messages incohérents avec la stratégie de l’élève. Dans le but d’augmenter l’efficacité du système, nous envisageons, entre autres, de proposer des profils de tuteurs et d’élèves.
Malgré les lacunes qui ont été détectées, il n’en demeure pas moins que QED-Tutrix est un système tutoriel innovateur. En effet, dans le domaine des preuves en géométrie, il est le seul à utiliser des émoticônes et à proposer différentes pistes de solution. De plus, son élaboration itérative, par une équipe multidisciplinaire, permet d’obtenir un système respectueux du travail de l’élève, ce qui se démarque de l’approche traditionnelle qui consiste à tenter de reproduire le raisonnement 
d’un expert. Les étapes suivantes de conception visent à intégrer des rétroactions sous forme de problèmes connexes et à proposer une aide à la construction de la figure. Notre système pourrait facilement être adapté au traitement des démonstrations en logique de premier ordre. Une adaptation pour le traitement du raisonnement sous forme d’argumentation non formelle pourrait aussi être envisagée. Enfin, la suggestion de diverses pistes de solution pourrait être implantée dans d’autres systèmes tutoriels.----------ABSTRACT
In the past years, Quebec’s school system imposes a growing amount of pressure on its teaching staff. They must juggle classes with more and more students while assuring the quality of their teaching to each of them. In this context, the use of intelligent tutoring systems which can assist 
the teacher in his or her work could allow the teacher to dedicate more energy to each student when it’s needed. However, the offer for tutoring systems for the learning of proof is limited. 
Moreover, the available systems force the student to work according to a determined order and they don’t provide help in the context of a free exploration of the problem. They also force the student to write formal proofs when high school teachers rarely demand. With this assessment in mind, we established the principal objective for our project which aims at offering an intelligent tutoring system that assists the student in an exploratory approach when solving geometry proofs instead of a formal proof writing approach. The system we offer is QED-Tutrix which was designed taking into account actual teacher interventions observed in a classroom environment. QED-Tutrix allows the teacher or didactician to construct a number of admissible proofs for a given problem according to the learning goals. The student can then try to solve the problem chosen by the teacher by using the different tools QED-Tutrix puts at his disposal. The student has access to a dynamic geometric figure he can work with in order to make conjectures, as well as to a repertoire of statements to create their proof and an interactive 
written proof they can use to complete their proof. All the statements he provides are analyzed by the system which then generates feedback through a chat window in order to guide the student during the exploration and solving of the problem.
QED-Tutrix’s elaboration was carried out by a multidisciplinary team comprised of experts in didactics of mathematics and in computer science. The system is built in an iterative manner by adopting a design in use approach which consists of a series of many cycles of research and 
development. Each cycle is ended with an experimentation which aims at validating the work accomplished and at collecting information to be reinvested in the following cycle. A first version of the system (GeoGebraTUTOR) was created to study, among other things, real teacher interventions which inspired the implementation of the second version (QED-Tutrix). This last version is 
described and analyzed in the following thesis.
We do not claim that the present QED-Tutrix version has measurable effects on academic results, since our aim at the moment is to make sure it allows the student to work in a fashion put forward by known didactic principles. Indeed, QED-Tutrix’s conception is rooted mainly in the didactical situation’s theory which represents a didactical context by a student-milieu interaction. However, we use an extended version of this theory in which a tutorial system playing 
a virtual teaching role may influence this student-milieu interaction. Moreover, we aim at offering a tutoring system that is a true geometrical workspace, meaning that it allows the student to solve problems by engaging in three mathematical processes described in the geometrical workspace model.
The didactic theories and conclusions drawn from our observations were implemented in QED-Tutrix. This resulted in a system made of four main software layers. The first of these layers is for the organization of the different proof solutions for a given problem. For each solution, the teacher or didactician registers all the inferences or proof steps which are admissible according to a specific learning context. Each inference includes a justification that is used to produce a result stemming from a group of premises. It is possible to combine the different inferences in order to generate a graph of all the different admissible solutions, since the results of one inference can be recycled as a premise for another. The different pathways of this graph which is the output of 
the first software layer allow for the account of the different solutions to each implemented problem.
In order to offer help that takes into account the cognitive state of the student exploring the problem, it is essential to keep track of the chronology of his or her actions. This memory was implemented in the second layer of the system. It contains information that is dynamic and evolves as problem solving occurs. It also overlays the solution graph which is static. Therefore, we indicate for each of the graphs nodes, the most recent activation time associated with the writing of the statement attached to it. This approach stands out from the way other systems operate and in which chronology is usually not taken into account since a solving sequence is imposed.
In order to be able to suggest alternative paths to a student who is stuck in his or her solving process, we chose to treat inferences according to an order of priority. This ranking is carried out by QED-Tutrix’s third layer which uses the data from the first two layers. In order to achieve this ordering, we look for the most advanced solution with the help of an original heuristic, 
elaborated for this project, which spares the system from running through all the admissible solutions. We then assign the highest priorities to the inferences which are part of the identified solution and that has been worked on recently by the student keeping his or her cognitive state in mind. The ability to suggest other solution option distances us from traditional tutorial systems which offer help only to complete an optimal solution.
This list of ranked inferences is used by the fourth and last layer of the system, meaning the layer which generates various feedback. Firstly, QED-Tutrix replies to the writing of each statement with instant feedback in the shape of emojis or short messages. It also allows the 
programming of particular messages associated with known common mistakes. Lastly, this layer of the system offers help with the next step which is inspired by actual teacher interventions. This last form of help was modelled by a finite state machine that sequentially treats the ranked inferences from the list and produces a series of hints to help the student complete them. Messages must be 
created for each of the inferences, but mechanisms are implemented in order to reuse messages according to the inferences content, limiting the number of entries. The feedback offered by these messages is similar in form to the feedback offered by other tutorial systems.
Approximately 450 inferences were produced and close to 900 messages were created in order to implement the five problems currently available in QED-Tutrix. It’s operating has been verified by an independent expert, which confirmed that the output of messages is true to the identified 
structure, but the evaluation of the most advanced solution is sometimes problematic. QED-Tutrix was then put through a second trial in a class of 4th year of high school. The students generally found the system to be useful and appreciated the experience. The analysis of the session 
recordings revealed that the generated messages help some students. Also, we observed different mathematical processes which confirmed QED- Tutrix’s geometrical workspace status. However, the efficiency of QED-Tutrix is limited when helping students with less mathematical abilities since the message structure is built with the average student as a reference. Problems with the 
identification of the most advanced solution also lead to incoherence between messages and student strategies. In order to enhance the system’s efficiency in helping the student solve problems, we contemplate, among other things, to differentiate tutorial profiles according to students solving profiles.
In spite of witnessing shortcomings, QED-Tutrix is an innovative tutorial system. Indeed, in the field of geometry proofs, it is the only automated tutoring system to use emojis and to suggest alternative solution paths. Moreover, the iterative and multidisciplinary approach adopted for its design and development stands out from a traditional approach which aims at reproducing expert 
reasoning. The next design steps aims at including feedback in the form of related problems and to provide help with building the geometrical figure. Our system could easily be adapted to handle first order logical proofs. An adjustment to process non- formal argumentation could also be 
considered. Finally, the suggestion of alternative solution
paths could be implemented in other tutorial systems",multimedia,948,not included

La questione è, in realtà, molto concreta. In una fase, come quella che molte imprese stanno vivendo, di ripensamento dei modelli organizzativi e di business, rispondere è d’importanza cruciale per il management. Le imprese, in generale, hanno investito molto per rendere efficaci i controlli interni: più addetti, nuovi sistemi informativi, maggiore lavoro per tutta l’organizzazione. L’investimento è stato spesso dettato da recenti obblighi normativi e dalle sollecitazioni di regolatori e autorità di vigilanza. Altre volte si è trattato di una scelta determinata dall’operare in contesti di mercato impegnativi, per esempio quelli internazionali, che implicano l’adozione di standard adeguati. La voce controlli ha, in ogni caso, acquisito un peso crescente nel conto economico diventando, inevitabilmente, un possibile target quando, pressate dalla bassa congiuntura, molte imprese si sono trovate a dover stringere la cinghia. E allora anche per gli Internal Auditor è diventato importante dare una misura del proprio contributo al risultato.
È in quest’ottica che l’Internal Audit costituisce un supporto per la corporate governance, offrendo un prezioso contributo alla valutazione del sistema di governo strategico e operativo dell’impresa e assumendo un atteggiamento proattivo per il suo miglioramento continuo. Tutto ciò determina lo sviluppo di una cultura del controllo interno, inteso non come un mero proliferare di controllori rispetto agli esecutori, ma come un sistema integrato d’azienda ove le attività di controllo si coniugano con quelle di gestione del business.
La professione dell’Internal Auditor è stata caratterizzata, nel corso degli anni, da un’importante evoluzione storica, che ha determinato lo spostamento del suo raggio d’azione da verifiche limitate principalmente ad aspetti di conformità normativa e procedurale ad attività di maggiore ampiezza nell’ambito del controllo sistemico, della consulenza organizzativa e della governance aziendale. Questo processo evolutivo ha richiesto un incremento degli skill per lo svolgimento della professione e ha determinato una maggiore visibilità e credibilità della stessa Funzione aziendale.
A tal fine l’Associazione Italiana Internal Auditor ha fornito un notevole contributo poiché, oltre a promuovere lo sviluppo delle tematiche di controllo interno e di gestione dei rischi verso tutti gli stakeholder interessati alla corporate governance, garantisce la diffusione degli Standard Internazionali per la Pratica Professionale dell’internal auditing (IPPF), sostiene la formazione continua per la professione e il conseguimento di certificazioni specifiche riconosciute a livello internazionale e contribuisce alla realizzazione di programmi di quality assurance.
Le organizzazioni hanno la necessità di considerare nuovi approcci alternativi alle tradizionali attività di Internal Audit, spinti da business in continua trasformazione e dall’evoluzione del panorama normativo e regolatorio che esercitano pressioni sui costi, sulle persone e sui processi. Il Continuous Auditing e il Continuous Monitoring, che si configurano quali nuove opportunità da affiancare all’attività di Internal Audit, utilizzati in modo adeguato, possono aiutare le organizzazioni a gestire in modo efficace le esposizioni ai principali rischi, in quanto consentono di rilevare, monitorare e prevenire anomalie in modo più facile, completo e tempestivo rispetto agli approcci tradizionali.
Il processo di Continuous Auditing contribuisce a garantire la conformità alle politiche e procedure aziendali. In molti casi, questo sistema può operare come strumento di «allarme» per individuare preventivamente aspetti critici del Sistema di Controllo Interno.
Significa quindi, eseguire verifiche ad elevata frequenza (fino, addirittura, nel continuo) su base dati integrali (senza dover campionare) e in automatico (utilizzando i CAAT).
L’uso implicito di strumenti automatizzati permette anche l’applicazione di nuove tecniche di analisi euristica in grado di evidenziare l’esistenza di problemi nascosti o non anticipati. Il processo di Continuous Monitoring permette, invece, di avere una visibilità realtime del corretto funzionamento e dei problemi dei processi operativi o di business dal punto di vista del manager. Il collegamento e l’osmosi di approcci tra i due processi arriva in profondità, a tal punto che in determinati casi gli strumenti automatizzati possono essere i medesimi, impiegati con ottiche e scopi diversi, ma sempre con l’obiettivo di minimizzare i tempi di intervento e le conseguenze di errori, di non conformità e di potenziali frodi.
Appare evidente il vantaggio che le organizzazioni possono trarre dall’introduzione di approcci di questo tipo, in termini di risparmi diretti e di minori problemi dei sistemi operativi e di quelli di controllo. Non si tratta di abbandonare gli audit tradizionali, si tratta di introdurre nuove tecniche che consentano di aumentare la copertura della funzione e di focalizzare meglio la pianificazione degli audit tradizionali che per loro natura sono molto affidabili ma anche particolarmente dispendiosi in termini di tempo e costi.
In quest’ottica, l’ottimizzazione della qualità dei controlli si lega alla capacità di prevedere i comportamenti a maggior rischio nei vari cicli aziendali che possono impattare sul business e quindi sul conto economico. La capacità di identificare ex ante un insieme di comportamenti anomali (dall’inosservanza delle procedure interne fino alla frode), costituisce la nuova sfida cui sono chiamate a rispondere le funzioni di controllo, congiuntamente alle funzioni di business. L’introduzione di strumenti di Continuous Monitoring o Continuous Auditing nelle organizzazioni consente la realizzazione di questi obiettivi.
In una survey pubblicata cinque anni fa si prevedeva che “ nei prossimi cinque anni gli internal auditor si focalizzeranno sempre più sui temi del continuous auditing and assessment, nel tentativo di ottimizzare e migliorare i processi di audit. Gli audit diventeranno più dinamici e saranno effettuati secondo necessità dettate più dai cambiamenti dei profili di rischio di volta identificati che da calendari di audit prestabiliti secondo le logiche tradizionali. In questa ricerca di maggiore efficacia ed efficienza gli auditor faranno leva sulla tecnologia combinata con la loro innata capacità analitica di identificare key risk indicators che possono monitorare al meglio le condizioni di rischio”. Quella che cinque anni fa sembrava solo una possibile evoluzione, ottimisticamente azzardata, delle funzioni di controllo, in questi ultimi anni è diventata realtà: in tutto il mondo le organizzazioni più avanzate hanno compiuto questo fondamentale passo avanti nel percorso evolutivo della funzione di Internal Audit, e sono sempre più aziende che stanno seguendo l’esempio dei leader, affacciandosi con interesse a questa soluzione. La maturità raggiunta dalle funzioni di controllo e dai suoi protagonisti, unita a una tecnologia finalmente in grado di analizzare e rendere disponibili i risultati in real time, ci consente di vedere con chiarezza le future evoluzioni.
Ecco che le imprese sono sempre più alla ricerca di tecnologie specifiche che garantiscano gli imprescindibili requisiti di trasparenza, sicurezza e disponibilità dei dati, nonché l’integrità di ogni singola transazione.
Il software di data mining maggiormente adottato in relazione al rispettivo fabbisogno, è Audit Command Language (ACL), con la finalità di rielaborare le informazioni secondo alcuni algoritmi associati agli indicatori di rischio, i quali a loro volta hanno il compito di attivare dei segnali di “alert” in caso di superamento dei livelli di soglia predeterminati.
Specificamente concepite per le attività di controllo e gestione dei rischi, le soluzioni ACL di Audit Management si rivelano essere le migliori attualmente sul mercato e sono riconosciute come leader nel campo della Data Analysis. Per questo oltre 14.500 aziende in tutto il mondo, di cui più di 100 tra le maggiori imprese italiane di tutti i settori, hanno già adottato ACL",multimedia,949,not included
,to_check,core,'Pisa University Press',01/06/2016 00:00,core,monitoring and testing in lte networks: from experimental analysis to operational optimisation,https://core.ac.uk/download/79621522.pdf,"L'avvento di LTE e LTE-Adavanced, e la loro integrazione con le esistenti tecnologie cellulari, GSM e UMTS, ha costretto gli operatori di rete radiomobile ad eseguire una meticolosa campagna di test e a dotarsi del giusto know-how per rilevare potenziali problemi durante il dispiegamento di nuovi servizi.
In questo nuovo scenario di rete, la caratterizzazione e il monitoraggio del traffico nonchè la configurazione e l'affidibilità degli apparati di rete, sono di importanza fondamentale al fine di prevenire possibili insidie durante la distribuzione di nuovi servizi e garantire la migliore esperienza utente possibile.
Sulla base di queste osservazioni, questa tesi di dottorato offre un percorso completo di studio che va da un'analisi sperimentale ad un'ottimizzazione operativa.
Il punto di partenza del nostro lavoro è stato il monitoraggio del traffico di un eNodeB di campo con tre celle, operativo nella banda 1800 MHz. Tramite campagne di misura successive, è stato possibile seguire l'evoluzione della rete 4G dagli albori del suo dispiegamento nel 2012, fino alla sua completa maturazione nel 2015. I dati raccolti durante il primo anno, evidenziavano uno scarso utilizzo della rete LTE, dovuto essenzialmente alla limitata penetrazione dei nuovi smartphone 4G. Nel 2015, invece, abbiamo assistito ad un aumento netto e decisivo del numero di utenti che utilizzano la tecnolgia LTE, con statistiche aggregate (come gli indici di marketshare per i sistemi operativi degli smartphones, o la percentuale di traffico video) che rispecchiano i trend nazionali e internazionali. Questo importante risultato testimonia la maturità della tecnologia LTE, e ci permette di considerare il nostro eNodeB un punto di osservazione prezioso per l'analisi del traffico.
Di pari passo con l'evoluzione dell'infrastruttura, anche i telefoni cellulari hanno avuto una sorprendente evoluzione nel corso degli ultimi due decenni, a partire da dispositivi semplici con servizi di sola voce, fino agli smartphone di ultima generazione che offrono servizi innovativi, come Internet mobile, geolocalizzazione e mappe, servizi multimediali, e molti altri.
Monitorare il traffico reale ci ha quindi permesso di studiare il comportamento degli utenti e individuare i servizi maggiormente utilizzati. Per questo, sono state sviluppate diverse librerie software per l'analisi del traffico. In particolare, è stato sviluppato in C++14 un framework/tool per la classificazione del traffico. Il progetto, disponibile su github, si chiama MOSEC, un acronimo per MOdular SErvice Classifier. MOSEC consente di definire e utilizzare un numero arbitrario di plug-in, che processano il pacchetto secondo le loro logiche e possono o no ritornare un valore di classificazione. Una strategia di decisione finale consente di classificare i vari flussi, basandosi sulle classificazioni di ciascun plug-in. Abbiamo quindi validato la bontà del processi di classificazione di MOSEC utilizzando una traccia labellata come ground-truth di classificazione.
I risultati mostrano una eccellente capacità di classificazione di traffico TCP-HTTP/HTTPS, mediamente superiore a quella di altri tool di classificazione (nDPI, PACE, Layer-7), ed evidenzia alcune lacune per quanto riguarda la classificazione di traffico UDP.
Le carattistiche dei flussi di traffico utente (User Plane) hanno un impatto diretto sul consumo energetico dei terminali e indiretto sul traffico di controllo (Control Plane) che viene generato. Pertanto, la conoscenza delle proprietà statistiche dei vari flussi consente di affrontare un problema del cross-layer optimization, per ridurre il consumo energetico dei terminali variando dei parametri configurabili sugli eNodeB.
E' noto che la durata della batteria dei nuovi smartphone, rappresenta uno dei maggiori limiti nell'utilizzo degli stessi. In particolare, lo sviluppo di nuovi servizi e applicazioni capaci di lavorare in background, senza la diretta interazione dell’utente, ha introdotto nuovi problemi riguardanti la durata delle batterie degli smartphone e il traffico di segnalazione necessario ad acquisire/rilasciare le risorse radio.
In conformità a queste osservazioni, è stato condotto uno studio approfondito sul meccanismo DRX (Discontinuous Reception), usato in LTE per consentire all’utente di risparmiare energia quando nessun pacchetto è inviato o ricevuto. I parametri DRX e RRC Inactivity Timer influenzano notevolmente l’energia consumata dai vari device. A seconda che le risorse radio siano assegnate o meno, l’UE si trova rispettivamente negli stati di RRC Connected e RRC Idle.
Per valutare il consumo energetico degli smartphone, è stato sviluppato un algoritmo che associa un valore di potenza a ciascuno degli stati in cui l’UE può trovarsi. La transizione da uno stato all’altro è regolata da diversi timeout che sono resettati ogni volta che un pacchetto è inviato o ricevuto. Utilizzando le tracce di traffico reale, è stata associata una macchina a stati a ogni UE per valutare il consumo energetico sulla base dei pacchetti inviati e ricevuti.
Osservando le caratteristiche statistiche del traffico User Plane è stata ripetuta la simulazione utilizzando dei valori dell’Inactivity Timer diversi da quello impiegato negli eNodeB di rete reale, alla ricerca di un buon trade-off tra risparmio energetico e aumento del traffico di segnalazione. I risultati hanno permesso di determinare che l'Inactivity Timer, settato originariamente sull'eNodeB era troppo elevato e determinava un consumo energetico eccesivo sui terminali. Diminuendone il valore fino a 10 secondi, si può ottenere un risparmio energetico fino al 50\% (a secondo del traffico generato) senza aumentare considerevolemente il traffico di controllo.
I risultati dello studio di cui sopra, tuttavia, non tengono in considerazione lo stato di stress cui può essere sottoposto un eNodeB per effetto dell'aumento del traffico di segnalazione, nè, tantomeno, dell'aumento della contesa di accesso alla rete durante la procedura di RACH, necessaria per ristabilire il bearer radio (o connessione RRC) tra terminale ed eNodeB.
Valutare le performance di sistemi hardware e software per la rete mobile di quarta generazione, cosi come individuare qualsiasi possibile debolezza all’interno dell’architettura, è un lavoro complesso. Un possibile caso di studio, è proprio quello di valutare la robustezza delle Base Station quando riceve molte richieste di connessioni RRC, per effetto di una diminuzione dell'Inactivity Timer.
A tal proposito, all’interno del Testing LAB di Telecom Italia, abbiamo utilizzato IxLoad, un prodotto sviluppato da Ixia, come generatore di carico per testare la robustezza di un eNodeB. I test sono consistiti nel produrre un differente carico di richieste RRC sull'interfaccia radio, similmente a quelle che si avrebbero diminuendo l'Inactivity Timer. Le proprietà statistiche del traffico di controllo sono ricavate a partire dall'analisi dalle tracce di traffico reale. I risultati hanno dimostrato che, anche a fronte di un carico sostenuto di richieste RRC solo una minima parte (percentuale inferiore all'1\% nel caso più sfavorevole) di procedure fallisce. Abbassare l'inactivity timer anche a valori inferiori ai 10 secondi non è quindi un problema per la Base Station.
Rimane da valutare, infine, cosa succede a seguito dell'aumento delle richieste di accesso al canale RACH, dal punto di vista degli utenti. Quando due o più utenti tentano, simultaneamente, di accedere al canale RACH, utilizzando lo stesso preambolo, l’eNodeB potrebbe non essere in grado di decifrare il preambolo. Se i due segnali interferiscono costruttivamente, entrambi gli utenti riceveranno le stesse risorse per trasmettere il messaggio di RRC Request e, a questo punto, l’eNodeB può individuare la collisione e non trasmetterà nessun acknowledgement, forzando entrambi gli utenti a ricominciare la procedura dall’inizio. Abbiamo quindi proposto un modello analitico per calcolare la probabilità di collisione in funzione del numero di utenti e del carico di traffico offerto, quando i tempi d’interarrivo tra richieste successive é modellata con tempi iper-esponenziali. In più, abbiamo investigato le prestazioni di comunicazioni di tipo Machine-to-Machine (M2M) e Human-to-Human (H2H), valutando, al variare del numero di preamboli utilizzati, la probabilità di collisione su canale RACH, la probabilità di corretta trasmissione considerando sia il tempo di backoff che il numero massimo di ritrasmissioni consentite, e il tempo medio necessario per stabilire un canale radio con la rete di accesso. I risultati, valutati nel loro insieme, hanno consentito di esprimere delle linee guida per ripartire opportunamente il numero di preamboli tra comunicazioni M2M e H2H.
The advent of LTE and LTE-Advanced, and their integration with existing cellular technologies, GSM and UMTS, has forced the mobile radio network operators to perform meticulous tests and adopt the right know-how to detect potential new issues, before the activation of new services.
In this new network scenario, traffic characterisation and monitoring as well as configuration and on-air reliability of network equipment, is of paramount relevance in order to prevent possible pitfalls during the deployment of new services and ensure the best possible user experience.
Based on this observation, this research project offers a comprehensive study that goes from experimental analysis to operational optimization.
The starting point of our work has been monitoring the traffic of an already deployed eNodeB with three cells, operative in the 1800 MHz band. Through subsequent measurement campaigns, it was possible to follow the evolution of the 4G network by the beginning of its deployment in 2012, until its full maturity in 2015. The data collected during the first year, showed a poor use of the LTE network, mainly due to the limited penetration of new 4G smartphone. In 2015, however, we appreciate a clear and decisive increase in the number of terminals using LTE, with aggregate statistics (e.g. marketshare for smartphone operating systems, or the percentage of video traffic) that reflect the national trend. This important outcome testifies the maturity of LTE technology, and allows us to consider our monitored eNodeB as a valuable vantage point for traffic analysis.
Hand in hand with the evolution of the infrastructure, even mobile phones have had a surprising evolution over the past two decades, from simple devices with only voice services, towards smartphones offering novel services such as mobile Internet, geolocation and maps, multimedia services, and many more.
Monitoring the real traffic has allowed us to study the users behavior and identify the services most used. To this aim, various software libraries for traffic analysis have been developed. In particular, we developed a C/C++ library that analyses Control Plane and User Plane traffic, which provides corse and fined-grained statistics at flow-level.
Another framework/tool has been exclusively dedicated to the topic of traffic classification. Among the plethora of existing tool for traffic classification we provide our own solution, developed from scratch. The project, which is available on github, is named MOSEC, an acronym for Modular SErvice Classifier.
The modularity is given by the possibility to implement multiple plug-ins, each one will process the packet according to its logic, and may or may not return a packet/flow classification. A final decision strategy allows to classify the various streams, based on the classifications of each plug-in.
Despite previous approaches, the ability of keeping together multiple classifiers allows to mitigate the deficiency of each classifiers (e.g. DPI\nomenclature{DPI}{Deep Packet Inspection} does not work when packets are encrypted or DNS\nomenclature{DNS}{Domain Name Server} queries don't have to be sent if name resolution is cached in device memory) and exploit their full-capabilities when it is feasible.
We validated the goodness of MOSEC using a labelled trace synthetically created by colleagues from UPC BarcelonaTech.
The results show excellent TCP-HTTP/HTTPS traffic classification capabilities, higher, on average, than those of other classification tools (NDPI, PACE, Layer-7). On the other hand, there are some shortcomings with regard to the classification of UDP traffic.
The characteristics of User Plane traffic have a direct impact on the energy consumed by the handset devices, and an indirect impact on the Control Plane traffic that is generated. Therefore, the acquaintances of the statistical properties of the various flows, allows us to deal with the problem of cross-layer optimization, that is reducing the power consumption of the terminals by varying some control plane parameters configurable on the eNodeB.
It is well known that the battery life of the new smartphones is one of the major limitations in the use of the same. In particular, the birth of new services and applications capable of working in the background without direct user interaction, introduced new issues related to the battery lifetime and the signaling traffic necessary to acquire/release the radio resources.
Based on these observations, we conducted a thorough study on the DRX mechanism (Discontinuous Reception), exploited by LTE to save smartphones energy when no packet is sent or received. The DRX configuration set and the RRC Inactivity Timer greatly affect the energy consumed by the various devices. Depending on which radio resources are allocated or not, the user equipment is in the states of RRC Connected and Idle, respectively.
To evaluate the energy consumption of smartphones, an algorithm simulates the transition between all the possible states in which an UE can be and maps a power value to each of these states. The transition from one state to another is governed by different timeouts that are reset every time a packet is sent or received. Using the traces of real traffic, we associate a state machine to each for assessing the energy consumption on the basis of the sent and received packets.
We repeated these simulations using different values of the inactivity timer, that appear to be more suitable than the one currently configured on the monitored eNodeB, looking for a good trade-off between energy savings and increased signaling traffic. The results highlighted that the Inactivity Timer set originally sull'eNodeB was too high and determined an excessive energy consumption on the terminals. Reducing the value up to 10 seconds permits to achieve energy savings of up to 50\% (depending on the underling traffic profile) without up considerably the control traffic.
The results of the study mentioned above, however, do not consider neither the stress level which the eNodeB is subject to, given the raise of signaling traffic that could occur, nor the increase of collision probability during the RACH procedure, needed to re-establish the radio bearer (or RRC connection ) between the terminal and eNodeB .
Evaluate the performance of hardware and software systems for the fourth-generation mobile network, as well as identify any possible weakness in the architecture, it is a complex job. A possible case study, is precisely to assess the robustness of the base station when it receives many requests for RRC connections, as effect of a decrease of the inactivity timer.
In this regard, within the Testing LAB of Telecom Italia, we used IxLoad, a product developed by Ixia, as a load generator to test the robustness of one eNodeB. The tests consisted in producing a different load of RRC request on the radio interface, similar to those that would be produced by decreasing the inactivity timer to certain values. The statistical properties for the signalling traffic are derived from the analysis of real traffic traces. The main outcomes have shown that, even in the face of an high load of RRC requests only a small part (less than 1\% in the most unfavorable of the cases) of the procedure fails. Therefore, even lowering the inactivity timer at values lower than 10 seconds is not an issue for the Base Station.
Finally, remains to be evaluated how such surge of RRC request impacts on users performance. If one of the users under coverage in the RRC Idle is paged for an incoming packet or need to send an uplink packet a state transition from RRC Idle to RRC Connected is needed. At this point, the UE initiates the random access procedure by sending the random access channel preamble (RACH Preamble). When two or more users attempt, simultaneously, to access the RACH channel, using the same preamble, the eNodeB may not be able to decipher the preamble. If the two signals interfere constructively, both users receive the same resources for transmitting the RRC Request message and, at this point, the eNodeB can detect the collision and will not send any acknowledgment, forcing both users to restart the procedure from the beginning. We have proposed an analytical model to calculate the probability of a collision based on the number of users and the offered traffic load, when the interarrival time between requests is modeled with hyper-exponential times.
In addition, we investigated some performance for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Human-to-Human (H2H) type communications, including the probability of correct transmission considering either the backoff time either the maximum number of allowed retransmissions, and the average time required to established a radio bearer with the access network.
The results, considered as a whole, have made possible to express the guidelines to properly distribute the number of preambles in H2H and M2M communications",multimedia,950,not included

Les simulateurs de vol sont des systèmes composés d'un système logiciel et d'actuateurs mécaniques qui recréés la dynamique d'un vrai vol avec un aéronef et qui sont notamment utilisés par les compagnies de transport aérien pour former leurs futurs pilotes. Ces simulateurs doivent recréer des scénarios de vol permettant d'exécuter des itinéraires réguliers de vol ou de confronter les pilotes à différentes situations d'urgence qui peuvent subvenir lors d'un vrai vol (p. ex., une tempête violente). Puisque les simulateurs de vol ont un impact direct sur la qualité de formation des pilotes, une batterie exhaustive de tests s'impose à chaque fois qu'une nouvelle version d'un simulateur doit être mise en opération. Une bonne partie de ces tests requièrent l'intervention d'un pilote qui stimule le système en réalisant une série d'opérations de contrôle provenant de scénarios de vol préparés par des experts en aéronautique, ce qui est gourmand en temps, en ressources humaines et en ressources financières. 
La raison de la nécessité de réaliser tous ces tests est que le logiciel en soit est constitué de plusieurs composants de type boîte noire dont le code source n'est pas disponible, ils sont fournis tels quels par les fournisseurs du composant réel d'origine devant être simulé (p. ex., un composant hydraulique d'un aéronef que nous voulons simuler). Puisque nous n'avons pas pas accès au code source, il n'est pas possible lors de la mise-à-jour de l'un de ces composants de savoir quel sera le changement dans le comportement du simulateur. Dans le meilleur des cas, un défaut dans un composant aura un impact local et, dans le pire des cas, il peut nuire à tous les autres composants du simulateur. Il est dans ce cas nécessaire d'utiliser une stratégie de test d'une large granularité couvrant à la fois le fonctionnement des composants eux-mêmes et  l'ensemble des fonctionnalités de vol du simulateur afin d'en assurer sa qualité. 
Dans le cadre de ces tests, afin de réduire le temps requis pour vérifier le bon comportement d'une nouvelle version d'un simulateur, nous proposons dans ce mémoire d'automatiser l'analyse des résultats de test en modélisant le comportement normal du système logiciel en utilisant de l'apprentissage automatique. Un tel modèle tente de recréer le comportement stable du système en bâtissant des règles reliant ses entrées à chacune de ses sorties. Les entrées sont constituées de métriques provenant des contrôles qui stimulent le système et les sorties sont constituées de métriques que nous pouvons observer. Nous produisons donc un modèle initial d'une version fiable du simulateur et nous validons par la suite le bon comportement des versions subséquentes en comparant leur comportement avec celui du modèle initial. Nous cherchons à voir s'il y a un écart trop important avec le modèle initial, ce nous considérons comme étant une déviation.
Le but final de notre recherche est de pouvoir appliquer notre méthodologie d'analyse des résultats de test dans l'industrie de la simulation. Afin d'avoir plus de flexibilité dans nos expérimentations, nous commençons d'abord par valider l'approche avec un simulateur plus simple et ouvert. Nous utilisons donc le simulateur de vol à source libre FlightGear comme cas d'étude pour évaluer notre approche de test. Ce simulateur utilise l'engin de vol très populaire JSBsim et la librairie SimGear pour modéliser les aéronefs et simuler leur comportement dynamique dans un environnement de vol. JSBsim est notamment utilisé par la Nasa à des fins de recherche. Nous réalisons d'abord un vol manuel en utilisant des périphériques de contrôle d'un ordinateur tout en enregistrant les données contenues dans le simulateur. Le vol doit être composé de toutes les opérations régulières de pilotage afin que le modèle que l'on en extrait représente fidèlement le comportement normal du simulateur. Nous réalisons par la suite plusieurs répétitions du même vol afin d'identifier des niveaux de seuils robustes pour déterminer au delà de quels écarts un métrique d'une nouvelle version doit être considéré comme déviant par rapport au modèle. Nous élaborons à cet effet cinq scénarios de mutation du comportement de la version initiale de notre simulateur afin de générer différentes versions ayant des métriques qui respectent le comportement normal du sytème ou présentant une déviation du comportement normal reliée à un problème fonctionnel. En sachant d'avance quelles mutations présentent des déviations et avec l'aide d'experts identifiant précisément les métriques qui dévient de leur comportement normal, nous pouvons construire un oracle avec lequel nous évaluons la précision et le rappel de notre approche de détection.
En particulier, dans le cadre de notre étude empirique sur FlightGear, nous modifions une version initiale du simulateur en y injectant cinq différentes mutations qui n'ont pas d'impact grave ou qui engendrent des problème fonctionnels avec lesquels nous évaluons notre approche. Les résultats montrent qu'en choisissant des niveaux de seuil initiaux lors d'une première calibration, notre approche peut détecter les métriques ayant des déviations avec un rappel majoritairement de 100% (un seul cas de mutation à 50%) et une précision d'au moins 40%. En ce qui a trait aux mutations ne changeant pas le comportement normal du simulateur, notre approche a un taux de fausses alarmes de 60%. Nous montrons également qu'avec une base de données plus large, il est possible de calibrer notre approche afin d'améliorer sa performance. Avec des niveaux de seuil optimaux qui sont calibrés pour chacune des mutations, nous obtenons un taux de rappel de 100% pour tous les cas, une précision d'au moins 50% pour les versions ayant des problèmes fonctionnels et un taux de fausses alarmes de 0% pour les versions n'ayant pas de problèmes fonctionnels.
Afin d'ouvrir la voie pour des améliorations futures, nous utilisons notre méthodologie pour faire une petite expérimentation connexe sur JSBsim afin de détecter les déviations dans les transitions entre les états stables de chacun des métriques. Nous utilisons la même modélisation du simulateur. Les résultats montrent que nous pouvons battre une classification aléatoire des déviations. Cette nouvelle approche n'en n'est qu'à ces débuts et nous sommes convaincu que nous pouvons obtenir des résultats plus significatifs avec de futurs travaux sur le sujet.
Nous proposons également dans les améliorations futures de descendre le niveau de granularité de notre modélisation du simulateur au niveau de chacun de ses composants. Cela permettrait d'isoler exactement qu'elle composant présente une déviation, et ainsi trouver la source du problème.----------ABSTRACT
Flight simulators are systems composed of software and mechanical actuators used to train crews for real flights. The software is emulating flight dynamics and control systems using components off-the-shelf developed by third parties. For each new version of these components, we do not know what parts of the system is impacted by the change and hence how the change would impact the behaviour of the entire simulator. Hence, given the safety critical nature of flight simulators, an exhaustive set of manual system tests must be performed by a professional pilot. Test experts then rely on the test pilot's feedback and on the analysis of output metrics to assess the correctness of a simulator's behaviour, which consumes time and money, even more these tests must be repeated each time one of the components is updated by its vendor. 
To automate the analysis of test results from new simulator versions, we propose a machine learning-based approach that first builds a model that mimics the normal behaviour of a simulator by creating rules between its input and output metrics, where input metrics are control data stimulating the system and output metrics are data used to assess the behaviour of the system. We then build a behavioural model of the last-known correctly behaving version of the simulator, to which we compare data from new versions to detect metric deviations. The goal of our research is to first build a model of the simulator, then detect deviations of new simulator versions using that model, and finally develop an automatic approach to flag deviations when there are functional problems
Our case study uses the open-source flight simulator Flight Gear, based on the well-known JSBsim flight dynamic engine currently used by the Nasa. Applying our approach, we first drive a manual basic flight using computer peripherals while recording metrics in the simulator. We then use the recorded metrics to build a model of this basic execution scenario. After repeating several times our flight we have enough data to identify robust metric deviation thresholds to determine when a metric in a new version is deviating too far from the model. 
We generate five different versions of FlightGear by injecting harmless and harmful modifications into the the simulator, then perform again our initial flight multiple times for each of those versions while recording input and output metrics. We rely on experts identifying which output metric should be deviating in each scenario to build an oracle. Using an initial threshold, our approach can detect most of the deviations in problematic versions with a near perfect recall (only one case at 50%) and a reasonable precision of at least 40%. For the versions without harmfull deviations we get a false alarm rate of 60%. By optimizing the threshold for each version, we get a perfect recall of 100%, a precision of at least 50%, and a false alarm rate of 0% for the good behaving versions.
To open the path for future work, we perform a case study on JSBsim using a variant of our basic deviation detection approach to detect transient deviations using the same model. Our results show that we can beat a random classification for one kind of deviation, however for other deviations our models do not perform as well. This new approach is just a first step towards transient deviation detection, and we are convinced that we can get better results in future work. We also propose to use finer-grained models for each component to be able to isolate the exact component causing a functional problem",multimedia,951,not included

Le matériel informatique graphique destiné aux ordinateurs de bureau ou aux systèmes embarqués traditionnels, ainsi que leur interface de programmation ne peuvent pas être utilisés dans les systèmes avioniques puisqu’ils ne se conforment pas aux règles de certifications DO-254 et DO-178B. Toutefois, on remarque le faible nombre d’outils de conceptions qui encadrent le développement d’applications graphiques avioniques, et ce malgré l’apparition de matériel graphique avionique de plus en plus performants. Suivant par exemple la méthode classique de conception en V, les ingénieurs doivent d’abord effectuer des choix de conception reliés à la sélection du matériel graphique avant de débuter une quelconque implémentation de code. Ainsi, il peut être difficile d’évaluer la pertinence de ces choix en évaluant les performances de traitement du matériel graphique puisque l’engin graphique n’aurait pas nécessairement été développé. Je propose donc un outil de conception permettant de prédire les performances de matériel graphique en termes d’images par secondes (FPS), basé sur OpenGL SC. L’outil crée des modèles non-paramétriques de performance du matériel en analysant, à l’aide d’algorithmes d’apprentissage, le temps de dessin de chaque image, lors du rendu d’une scène 3D synthétique. Cette scène est rendue à quelques reprises en faisant varié certaines de ses caractéristiques spatiales (nombre de sommets, taille de la scène, taille des textures, etc.) qui font parte intégrante du logiciel de vision synthétique habituellement développé dans ce domaine. Le nombre de combinaisons de ces caractéristiques utilisées durant l’entraînement supervisé des modèles de performance n’est qu’un très petit sous-ensemble de toutes les combinaisons, le but étant de prédire par extrapolation celles manquantes. Pour valider les modèles, une scène 3D fournie par un partenaire industriel est dessinée avec des caractéristiques non traitées durant la phase d’entraînement, puis le FPS de chaque image rendue est comparé au FPS prédit par le modèle. La tendance centrale de l’erreur de prédiction est ensuite démontrée comme étant moins de 4 FPS.----------ABSTRACT
Within the strongly regulated avionics engineering field, conventional graphical desktop hardware and software API cannot be used because they do not conform to the DO-254 and DO-178B certifications. We observe the need for better avionic graphical hardware, but system engineers lack system design tools related to graphical hardware. The endorsement of an optimal hardware architecture by estimating the performance of a graphical software, when a stable rendering engine does not yet exist, represents a major challenge.  There is also a high potential for development cost reduction, by enabling developers to have a first estimation of the performance of its graphical engine at a low cost. In this paper, we propose to replace expensive development platforms by a predictive software running on desktop. More precisely, we present a system design tool that helps predict the rendering performance of graphical hardware based on the OpenGL SC API. First, we create non-parametric models of the underlying hardware, with machine learning, by analyzing the instantaneous frames-per-second (FPS) of the rendering of a synthetic 3D scene and by drawing multiple times with various characteristics that are typically found in synthetic vision applications. The number of characteristic combinations used during this supervised training phase is a subset of all possible combinations, but performance predictions can be arbitrarily extrapolated. To validate our models, we render an industrial scene with characteristics combinations not used during the training phase and we compare the predictions to real values. We find a median prediction error of less than 4 FPS",multimedia,952,not included

Cham: Springer International Publishing;  2014.Simulation in robotics is often a love-hate relationship: while simulators do save us a lot of time and effort compared to regular deployment of complex software architectures on complex hardware, simulators are also known to evade many (if not most) of the real issues that robots need to manage when they enter the real world. Because humans are the paragon of dynamic, unpredictable, complex, real world entities, simulation of human-robot interactions may look condemn to fail, or, in the best case, to be mostly useless. This collective article reports on five independent applications of the MORSE simulator in the field of human-robot interaction: It appears that simulation is already useful, if not essential, to successfully carry out research in the field of HRI, and sometimes in scenarios we do not anticipate",multimedia,953,not included

Different approaches have been used for the development of plant disease models, with relevant improvements in recent years. 
Empirical models have been elaborated using data collected under variable field conditions since the second half of the last century. The so called 3 10 rules for predicting first seasonal infection of grape downy mildew is a precursor of this empirical approach for understanding relationships between pathogens, plants and the environment. By using this approach, the model is developed by searching mathematical or statistical relationships between field collected data and these relationships do not necessarily have cause-effect meaning. Lack of knowledge, accuracy and, especially, robustness are the main weaknesses of these models, which impose accurate validation and, usually, proper calibration when these models are used in different environments or under changing climate. Recent methods of data analysis, like for instance neural networks, improve the capability of searching the mathematical structure of the model but they do not overcome the above mentioned weaknesses.
Mechanistic models are a new class of models based on knowledge of biological and epidemiological behaviour of the system under study. These models (also referred to as explanatory, theoretical, or fundamental) explain the pathosystem on the basis of what is known about how the system works in relation to the influencing variables. Mechanistic models are dynamic, because they analyse the changes over time of the components of an epidemic due to the external, influencing variables. Dynamic modelling is based on the assumption that the state of the pathosystem in every moment can be quantitatively characterised and that changes in the system can be described by mathematical equations. These models overcome the weakness of the empirical models. Compared to the 3 10 rule, a mechanistic model for grape downy mildew increased the overall accuracy of the predictions from ~60% to ~90%.
Complexity of mechanistic models has been regarded as a problem for the implementation of models in practical disease control, compared to the simplicity of the empirical models. This is a false problem, because confusing complexity of the mathematical framework of the model with complexity of model output is misleading. Indeed, it is possible to use complex models, able to depict the complexity of the biological systems, to produce simply, easy-to-use output for growers. Implementation of the above mentioned mechanistic model for grape downy mildew in a Decision Support System used by viticulturists clearly demonstrates the inconsistency of the \u201ccomplexity paradigm\u201d",multimedia,954,not included

The detection is based on the multi-sensor approaches, including gyrometer, accelerometer, radar, video and so on.

Using subspace modeling techniques, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm to perform the unsafe states detection. The feature space are decomposed into the normal and anomalous subspace, where the normal space are assumed as the major components of the driving patterns, and significant deviations from the modeled normal subspace are signaled as unsafe states. In addition, the algorithm works in a real-time way incorporating a implementation of sliding window, which enable the method to adapt over time to address changes in the new emerged driving situations. We have implemented our algorithm with a prototype system installed in a transit bus, validations are performed in real driving situations.

,to_check,core,,01/01/2013 00:00,core,absolute quantification of choline-related biomarkers in breast cancer biopsies by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry,,"Abstract. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that choline metabolism is altered in a wide variety of cancers. In breast tumours, the choline metabolite profile is characterized by an elevation of phosphocholine and total choline-compounds. This pattern is increasingly being exploited as biomarker in cancer diagnosis. The majority of in vitro metabolomics studies, for biomarkers quantification in cell cultures or tissues, entail proton NMR spectroscopy. Although many &quot;targeted&quot; approaches have been proposed to quantify metabolites from standard one-dimensional (1D) NMR experiments, the task is often made difficult by the high degree of overlap characterizing 1 H NMR spectra of biological samples. Here we present an optimized protocol for tissue extraction and absolute quantification of choline, phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine by means of liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). The selected chromatographic separation system with a HILIC (hydrophilic interaction chromatography) amide column effectively separates free choline and its phopshorylated derivatives, contrary to failure observed using standard reversed-phase chromatography. The metabolite absolute quantification is based on external calibration with commercial standards, and is validated by a parallel 1D proton NMR analysis. The LC-MS/NMR analysis is applied to three breast carcinoma specimens obtained by surgical excision, each one accompanied by a control tissue sample taken outside the tumor margin. The metabolite concentrations measured are in good agreement with previous results on metabolic profile changes of breast cancer. Each of the three cancerous biopsies, when compared with the control tissue, exhibit a highly increased levels phosphocholine, total choline and phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine ratio. demonstrated by numerous in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies  In synthesis all of the altered metabolites participate in the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the major membrane phospholipid PtdCho, as shown in the schematic diagram  In vivo detection of choline metabolites by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H MRS) has been proven to be useful in the diagnosis of cancer  The present work builds on the established correlation between choline metabolism modification and malignant tumor proliferation and focuses on three cancer indicators, namely tCho and PCho concentrations and PCho/GPCho ratio. A metabonomic study is conducted on three breast carcinoma specimens obtained by surgical excision, each one accompanied by a control tissue sample taken outside the tumor margin. The study entails tissue extraction of metabolites and a parallel analysis conducted by onedimensional (1D) 1 H NMR spectroscopy, taken as standard technique, and an optimized implementation of a LC/ESI-MS method. The key feature of the method, which was already reported in 2011  Scope of the present study is to prove that the assessment of breast cancer markers by LC/ESI-MS is feasible and diagnostically valuable. This technique shows a resolution advantage for assaying choline derivatives, and potentially many other target molecules, compared to NMR, and could complement the latter. After the necessary large scale standardization of protocols, mass spectrometry (MS) could reduce the traumatic impact of current bioptic procedures based on its sensitivity and, eventually, replace the current diagnostic protocols.  M.C. Mimmi et al. / Absolute quantification of choline-related biomarkers 73 Experimental section Reagents Standard compounds were obtained from SigmaAldrich. Choline, phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine were respectively in the form of choline chloride, phosphorylcholine chloride calcium salt tetrahydrate and sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine 1:1 cadmium chloride adduct. All solvents used were of HPLC grade. Instrumentation The LC/MS system consisted of a QqTOF mass spectrometer (Q-STAR by Applied Biosystems-SCIEX) equipped by an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and an Agilent 1100 series micro LC pump. 1 H NMR experiments were acquired on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Tissue extraction Human breast-tissue specimens were obtained from three patients (referred to as patients A, B, C) by surgical excision  Choline compounds were extracted from tissue by a method derived from Bligh and Dyer  1) The frozen powder was suspended in 0.400 ml methanol/chloroform (2:1 v/v) and, after thorough vortexing, left overnight at -20 • C. 2) The sample was then centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant extract was separated and stored at -20 • C. 3) The residue was submitted to re-extraction with 0.250 ml of methanol/chloroform/water (2:1:0.8 by volume) and left at -20 • C for at least four hours. 4) The supernatants from both extractions were combined and, after addition of first 0.100 ml of chloroform and then 0.100 ml of water, the resulting solution was submitted to 5 minutes centrifugation. The procedure separates two phases: an aqueous phase containing methanol at the top and an organic phase at the bottom; in some case denatured proteins was observed in the middle. 5) The aqueous phase (that contains the hydrosoluble choline compounds) was directly lyophylized and then redissolved in 0.020 ml water and 0.800 ml methanol (2.4% H 2 O by volume). The resulting minute amounts of precipitates (proteins) were removed by filtration with 0.2m filters. The filtrated solution was stored at -80 • C until it was used for either LC/ESI-MS or NMR analysis. LC/ESI-MS Analysis The LC-MS method previously reported  Positive ESI parameters for standard MS scan were tuned for best sensitivity under HPLC conditions. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer gas (GS1) and curtain gas (CUR): GS1 and CUR were set respectively at 20.00 and 15.00 psi. The DP (declustering potential), FP (focusing potential) and DP2 (secondary declustering potential) were set respectively at 40, 230 and 15 V. The ion spray voltage (IS) was 5 kV. The positively charged molecular ions of choline compounds were monitored by extracting the ion chromatogram of selected mass ranges including the target molecules mass. Data treatment The analytes peaks were integrated with the software Analyst QS 1.1 (Applied Biosystems-SCIEX) by evaluating the extracted ion content (XIC) counts. The correspondence between measured XIC counts and absolute concentrations was established by calibration curves with standard compounds. Details can be found in the Supplementary Material Section. NMR spectroscopy Analysis An aliquot of each aqueous extract (corresponding to 75 mg of frozen pulverized tissue) was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 0. Monodimensional 1 H spectra were collected using a sweep width of 8 kHz and a time domain of 8 K complex data points, with 64 acquisitions and 8 silent scans. Flip-angle pulses of 30 • were applied with a relaxation delay of 5 s. Presaturation was used for suppression of the HOD signal during the whole initial delay. The adopted pulse sequence includes the Electronic Reference Signal (ERETIC TM ) [2] synthesized by an electronic device, which was used for the determination of absolute concentrations. The reference signal provides a pseudo-FID that has all the characteristics of a real NMR signal, after proper calibration, and whose parameters (frequency, magnitude, phase, T2) are controlled from the spectrometer console. Spectra acquisition and processing were performed with the Bruker software TOPSPIN. Data treatment After FID apodization with a shifted sine square window function (90 • ) all spectra were phased, Fourier-transformed and chemical-shift referenced. The integral value of significant peaks were measured. In some cases Gaussian window multiplication of the FID was necessary to enhance resolution of signals: the deconvolution of the envelopes of interest was performed by fitting a mixed Lorentzian/Gaussian lineshape to the experimental pattern. The peak modeling,  M.C. Mimmi et al. / Absolute quantification of choline-related biomarkers 75 performed with TOPSPIN, was used only for the estimate of the integral fractions to be assigned to the single components of peak envelopes. The absolute quantification of metabolites of interest (namely Cho, PCho, GPCho) was based on N-trimethyl peaks  Results Extraction protocol The very first step of frozen tissue pulverization was modified with respect to our previously reported protocol  LC/ESI-MS The LC/ESI-MS analysis of the bioptic aqueous extracts focused on three significant metabolites for cancer diagnosis: Cho, PCho, and GPCho. The three molecules are hydrosoluble and positively charged, due to the choline moiety, hence all are detected by ESI-MS under positive mode. The protocol for chromatographic separation and mass spectrum acquisition had been already established  The Total Ion Current (TIC) Chromatogram of a standard mixture solution of Cho, PCho, GPCho is shown in  The concentration of free Cho and Cho derivatives obtained by LC/ESI-MS analysis are reported in  NMR Bioptic aqueous extracts, obtained as described in Experimental Section, were analyzed by 1 H 1D NMR without any buffer addition. Examples of full spectra relative to two representative biologic samples are shown in  The Cho compounds estimation resulting by 1D NMR analysis is reported in  Discussion Sample choice The first qualifying point of the present study is the availability of a double specimen for each of the three enrolled patients: the first derived from the proliferating carcinoma and the second from healthy tissue outside the tumor margin. Though in principle every metabonomic study should consider cancer biopsies and healthy tissue controls from the same individuals, i.e. internal controls, to account for the individual metabolome variability, this is not always possible and many theoretical conclusions on metabolic markers are based on the differential absolute concentrations in cancerous and normal tissues, without taking into account the tissue source. In this study, on the contrary, we could exclude that the concentration changes of choline compounds were related to the intrinsic variability among individuals. Methodology: NMR vs LC-MS NMR and Mass Spectrometry (MS) represent the principal approaches in metabolomics/metabonomics studies. In this type of application, NMR has many advantages such as high information content of the resulting spectra, ease of quantification and little need of optimization for the analysis conditions. MS techniques can cover a wide chemical diversity with high sensitivity and resolution, but require a preliminary optimization of the chromatographic separation. The present study highlights the complementarity of the two analytical approaches. We adopted 1D NMR as conventional reference technique to collect a full set of information on the aqueous extract of biopsies. The use of 1D NMR for the analysis of unfractionated tissue extract, with hundreds of overlapping resonances can not afford complete assignment and accurate peak integration. For the quantitative determination of our target biomarkers with well established assignment, however, we could adopt the approach of fitting overlapped 1D spectra with modeled peaks. The modeling Only the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) are shown for Cho (blue traces), PCho (red traces), GPCho (green traces). The Cho and PCho components occurring at the retention time of GPCho (at 15-16 min) are due to in-source fragmentation of the latter metabolite. The splitting of the Cho peak into two peaks is likely to be ascribed to the different possible mechanisms of interactions of the molecule with the HILIC solid phase at the operating conditions. A remarkable difference in the relative intensity of Cho, PCho and GPCho signals is found and is consistent with cancer-related metabolism alteration. approach allowed the concentration estimate of Cho, PCho and GPCho in the whole set of sample, though for 2 out of 6 samples it was not possible to resolve PCho and GPCho, and only the total amount of the two compounds was reported. Differently, the combination of on-line HILIC separation and ESI-MS allowed to resolve the target peaks without the necessity of chemical derivatization. The LC-MS quantification of Cho derivatives in the test samples was obtained by interpolation of the LC-MS response, based on calibration curves obtained under the same experimental conditions. Although LC-MS quantitative assessment is safely carried out based on isotopically labeled internal standards, the response for Cho compounds is reasonably linear over the working range (correlation coefficients between 0.9686 and 0.9892 low R 2 values due to random errors). Some critical aspects of the LC-MS approach, that arise from reproducibility of the measurements, remain inherently unavoidable. Some significant metabolite level differences observed in  78 M.C.

In this perspective, the first problem to face is the need for a valid methodology for ancient landscape ecosystem reconstruction, before dealing with monuments and building. On the basis of an intense multi-disciplinary discussion and the previous VH Lab experience in this field, in this article we are presenting a scheme for a standardized reconstruction procedure, where the landscape is built using all available sources and elevation data obtained by a photogrammetry process on historical pictures. Ecosystem areas are then calculated through GIS elaboration in GRASS-GIS environment, through a procedure which may be shared for any situation of historical landscape reconstruction, allowing the matching and the mathematical processing of geographical data aimed to the definition of different ecological areas (both in terms of natural vegetation and cultivated lands). Maps are then created to be imported in procedural landscape generation engines: the last part of the paper focuses on the lack of effective open source software in this field, and a possible proposal implementation in this sense1.

o-DGT samplers were deployed in the influent and effluent of a typical
UK wastewater treatment plant (WWTP); the influent was also sampled
with a conventional automatic sampler (Auto) and by grab (Grab) sampling.
All the samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for 40 target antibiotics
(including 16 sulfonamides (SAs), 12 fluoroquinolones, 6 macrolides,
2 ionophores, 2 diaminopyimidines, 1 aminocoumarin, and 1 lincosamide).
The diffusion coefficients (<i>D</i>) of these antibiotics

At least for Machine Learning approaches, this task is harder than standard (single label) classification because it is not clear for the learning software whether the presence of a feature (typically a word) is an indication of one class or another (e.g. whether the presence of the word ‘salt’ is an indication for the category cooking or for the category Austrian food). Multi-label classification is a real challenge if the number of classes is very high and if the number of training documents per category is unevenly distributed. We are presenting experiments with the JRC EuroVoc Indexer software JEX (Steinberger et al. 2012), which has been trained for all official EU languages on tens of thousands of documents per language to assign the thousands of class labels of the EuroVoc thesaurus . JEX is a multi-label classification system using a bag-of-words document representation. When applying such a tool that uses word forms as classifier features to languages as different as Germanic (e.g. English), Romance (e.g. French), Slavic (e.g. Czech or Polish) and Finno-Ugric languages (e.g. Estonian or Hungarian), the question arises how much the classifier performance differs. It can be expected that the significantly higher ratio of word forms to lemmas in Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages has a negative impact on the classifier performance, or that more training material would be needed for these more highly inflected languages to achieve the same performance. Similarly, one might wonder whether part-of-speech (POS) information is useful. JEX will soon be made available to parliamentary and other users. The experiments described in this chapter thus have a practical relevance as they can give an indication to the users and their technical partners as to whether they should invest in improving the software through linguistic pre-processing.JRC.G.2-Global security and crisis managemen",multimedia,960,not included

entre le 15 septembre et le 28 f'evr i.er 1989. Pendant cette peri ode
nous avons commence par monter un systeme PIXE d'analyse des oeuvres
d'art des collections de musee. PIXE est une technique multi-elementai
re, sensible, bon marche, rapide et ce qui est le plus
important dans le cas d'espece non destructive. Nous avons ainsi
obtenu des resultats preliminaires sur des echantillons de verre, des
etaIons qeoLoqi.ques , des pigments de peinture et des objets en or.
D'une certaine mani.ere, ces experiences ont ete plut6t un
apprentissage pour moi et l'equipe AGLAE. Nous nous sommes
familiarises avec l'accelerateur, la chambre d'analyse, le detecteur
de rayons X, l'eIectron.ique d'acquisition. Les premiers resul.t ats
sent; t res encourageants, il reste pourtant beaucoup de travail a
fournir pour que le systeme PIXE d'AGLAE soit operationnel en
routine.
Nous n'avons, de plus, qu'un temps limite de faisceau pour le
PIXE, puisque la priorite est donnee aux tests -verifier que
l'accelerateur est bien conforme aux specifications du constructeur.
L'accelerateur presente quelques problemes avec la source d'ions avec
comme consequence un courant de faisceau Leqeremerrt instable. De
plus, nous avons utilise une chambre provisoire. La nouvelle chambre
definitive a ete construite a Strasbourg et est en cours
d'installation. Il n'y a pas a l'heure actuelle un moyen sur pour
mesurer le courant de particules dans le cas d'echanti Ll.oris epai.s,
c'est pourquoi les resultats presentes ici ne s~nt que relatifs. Un
hacheur de faisceau (un composant pour mesurer le courant en
prelevant peri.odq.uiement; une partie du faisceau) est en cours de
construction a Jussieu-Universite Paris VII et sera monte au Louvre
en avril.
Nous avons porte nos efforts particulierement sur 'quatre
etalons de verre, qui represent erit les d.i f ferent s types de verre
etud.ies par les archeo Loques et les historiens d 'art. Ces etal.ons
sont bien connus et contiennent 27 elements chimiques entre le sodium
et le plomb dans des quarit i.tes variables comprises entre 100ppm et
35%. On a obtenus des resu l.tats avec une erreur relative comprise
entre 10 et 20% ,avec parfois des desaccords d'un facteur trois.
Les premiers echant i l.Lons que nous avons ree.l Lemerit analyses
sont des pigments de pe inture broyes provenant de la boutique ""A la
momie"", une maison de commerce en exercice pendant les 18 et 1gemes
siecles. Nous avons alors prouve que PIXE pouvait etre utilise pour
determiner les elements majeurs, mineurs et traces rent rant dans la
composition de ces pigments. De subtiles differences ont ete decelees
entre des pigments de meme denomination, et au contraire des pigments
avec des noms differents ont la meme composition chimique.
Le systeme de faisceau extrait a ete teste sur plusieurs
objets, y compris sur un tableau-faux primitif italien- , un cadre
dore du 15eme siecle et une petite statue en or antique. Pour
l'analyse de la plupart des objets de musee nous serons amene s a
utiliser ce systeme a l'air. 11 est donc crucial que ce systeme soit
parfaitement regle.
On a egalement commence a etudier l'atmosphere a l'interieur du
Louvre afin de determiner si des poussieres presentes dans les
galeries s~nt nocives pour les oeuvres d'art qui y sont conservees.
L'analyse des filtres aerosols pourra etre effectuee par AGLAE avec
seulement des modifications mineures sur le porte-cible.
Les resultats presentes ici ne s~nt pas entierement
satisfaisants. 11 est tout a fait rassurant que tous les equipements
et composants fonctionnent bien pour acquerir les spectres. Mais je
pense qu'il faut encore reduire les erreurs experimentales en
ameliorant le traitement des spectres(materiel et logiciel) pour que
le Louvre soit dote d'un systeme PIXE sur et precis.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Louvre Museum is the first museum in the world to have its own
particle accelerator for the study and analysis of works of art and
archaeology. The Laboratoire de Recherche des Musees de France has
thus taken a bold leap into the future with AGLAE, a powerful ""high-tech""
approach to the conservation of our cultural heritage.
This accelerator will enable the museum scientists to use a variety
of ion-beam techniques on works of art and archaeology, including
PIXE, PIGE, NRA, RBS and C-14 dating.
o
This progress report describes the work I accomplished between 15
September 1988 and 28 February 1989. During this time we have begun
to set up a PIXE system for the analysis of works of art in the
museum's collection. PIXE is multi-elemental, sensitive, inexpensive,
rapid, and most importantly, non-destructive. We have so far
acquired preliminary data on samples of glass, geological standards,
painting pigments, and gold artifacts. In a sense, these experiments
have been more of a learning experience for me and the AGLAE team. We
are becoming familiar with the accelerator, the target chamber, the
x-ray detector, the fast-pulse electronics, and the x-ray spectrum
reduction code. Although we have made a good start, much work still
needs to be done to make the AGLAE PIXE system ""state-of-the-art"".
We have had limited access to beam time for PIXE. Of course the
highest priority has been to ensure that the accelerator meets the
manufacturers specifications. The accelerator has had problems with
the ion source; as a result the beam current has not been very
stable. The target chamber we are using is a temporary one. A new one
has been built in Strasbourg and will be installed in March. There is
presently no reliable way of measuring the incident beam current for
thick samples, thus all the results presented here are relative. A
beam-chopper (a device for measuring the beam current) is being built
at Jussieu and will brought to the Louvre in April.
We have concentrated our efforts on four glass standards, which were
designed to duplicate the types of glass studied by archaeologists
and historians. These standards are well characterized and contain 27
elements between Na and Pb in quantities from 100 ppm to 35%. We have
been able to obtain results that are generally within 10 - 20% of the
given values, however, some occasionally there is a discrepancy of a
factor of three.
The firt ""real"" samples we have analyzed were pure pigments from the
boutique ""A la Momie"", a house of commerce in Paris during the 18th
and 19th centuries. We have seen how PIXE can be used to
quantitatively determine the major, minor, and trace elemental
composition of these paint pigments. Subtle differences were detected
between similar pigments, and pigments with different labels were
shown to have the same chemical composition.
The beam-in-air system has been tested on several samples, including
a false italian primitive, a gilded frame from the 15th century, and
a small gold statue from antiquity. For the analysis of most museum
objects we will be using this extracted beam system. It is thus vital
that we get it working well.
We are about start running air sampling equipment inside the Louvre
Museum in order to determine if any harmful pollutants are present in
the galleries that hold precious works of art. Analysis of the
aerosol filters can be done at AGLAE with only minor modifications of
the target holder.
I must say that I do not feel very confident about the numbers
presented here. I am glad we have all the equipment working to the
point that we can get results, but I have doubts that all the
hardware and software is working properly. We must now work to find
and reduce the experimental uncertainties, in order for the Louvre to
have a reliable and accurate PIXE system.

AGLAE - LRMF
I. INTRODUCTION
During the last four years the Louvre Museum has been undergoing
a major renovation. Not only is the main entrance going to be a giant
glass pyramid, but three stories under the pyramid a team of
scientists will be bombarding precious works of art with a particle
accelerator. Analyse au Grand Louvre par Accelerateur Electrostatique
(AGLAE) is a part of the Laboratoire de Recherche des Musees de France
(LRMF), which has been given more space and equipment in a new
underground laboratory. It is only recently that methods of analysis
using high energy ion-beams (protons, alphas, 15N, etc) have been
applied to works of art and archaeology, and usually by physicists
working in nuclear laboratories in their spare time. The Louvre Museum
is thus the first museum to have an accelerator to be used exclusively
for the study and analysis of works of art and archaeology. The LRMF
has taken a bold leap into the future with this powerful ""high-tech""
approach to the conservation of our cultural heritage.
II. PIXE at AGLAE
My expertise is with particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE) and
I have been concerned with developing a PIXE system at AGLAE for the
study and analysis of works of art. We have had several opportunities
to do some PIXE analyses under vacuum, including pigment samples,
glass standards, geological standards, and gold samples. Although the
spectra were acquired under conditions that were not ideal, we were
able to perform tests of the target chamber, x-ray detector and
electronics, and the PIXE spectrum reduction code. All results
presented here are therefore considered preliminary and subject to
change.
a. Accelerator
The accelerator, a 2.0 Mev tandem pelletron, was purchased from
National Electrostatic Corporation in Middleton Wisconsin. It is
capable of accelerating protons from 0.3 to 4.0 Mev, alpha particles
from 0.3 to 6.0 Mev, and 15N ions to 8.0 Mev. In addition it can
accelerate deuterons and 3He ions. Guaranteed beam current for protons
is 5 pa through a 1 mm2 collimator. It was installed in the winter and
spring of 1988, and the first beam was realized in June 1988. Tests
and practice with the machine have been taking place ever since then,
and are expected to continue through the end of March.
B. Target area
The target chamber we are using is a temporary one. The target
ladder can hold up to six samples and is moved manually. The sample
surface is perpendicular to the axis of the incident beam. X-rays are
detected at a backward angle of 135 degrees. The detector is
collimated, and subtends a solid angle of 0.5 sr. A new target chamber
has been fabricated in Strasbourg and will be delivered to the Louvre
on 3 March. This new chamber is very versatile and will be used for
PIXE, PIGE, RBS, and NRA.
A beam-chopper for measuring the incident beam current has been
built at Jussieu. It is presently undergoing tests and will be brought
to the Louvre at the end of March. Presently the beam current is
determined by measuring the charge acquired by the target, target
holder, and target chamber, which are electrically isolated from the
rest of the accelerator. Since this method is not reliable, I have
designed and will be building a device to determine the beam current
by measuring the protons backscattered from a thin mylar foil placed
in front of the target. This thin foil monitoring technique has the
advantages of eliminating charge buildup on insulating samples
analyzed under vacuum, and it can be used to monitor the beam current
when analyzing samples in air with an extracted beam.
C. Electronics
The experimental setup for the x-ray electronics during PIXE
analyse is shown in figure 1. The detector is an EG&G Ortec 7900
2
Si(Li), with 30 mm2 area, 8.0 pm Be window, and a FWHM resolution of
147 ev at 5.895 kev. The high voltage bias is supplied by an Ortec 459
power supply. An Ortec 972 spectroscopy amplifier and an Ortec 444
biased amplifier are used together for pulse-processing and dead-time
corrections. A Seiko EGG 7800 multi-channel analyzer with a Seiko 1820
ADC interface is used to collect the spectra. An Enertec 7143 linear
ratemeter is used to monitor the x-ray count rate. The charge induced
by the beam current is measured by a Brookhaven Instruments
Corporation 1000a current integrator, and stored in an Ortec 996
counter and timer.
In order to obtain a resolution of 147 ev on a real sample it is
necessary to keep the amplifier close to the detector (less than 3 m)
and to acquire the data with the vacuum pumps off. Mechanical
vibration from the pumps adds almost 15 ev to the resolution. (We are
working to better isolate the pumps from the target chamber.)
D. PIXAN reduction code
Since my experience with computers has been with DEC and Apple
computers, I have had to become familiar with SUN (UNIX) and IBM (DOS)
computers. PIXE spectra are analyzed on a SUN MS 3/260 workstation.
The computer program PIXAN is used to reduce an x-ray spectrum
to its elemental composition, and it does this in two parts. The first
part of the program calculates the areas of the characteristic peaks.
The background is subtracted and then the peaks are fitted to a
modified gaussian form. The area of the characteristic peaks are
directly proportional to the number of x-rays coming from the
characteristic elements. The second part determines the theoretical x-ray
yield given the composition of the sample and the energy of the
proton beam. It is then necessary to combine the results of the two
parts to get the elemental composition in parts per million (ppm). The
program is designed to be used for both thin and thick targets.
I have had to spend most of my time geting PIXAN to run
correctly. It is an excellent program, but it evolved over a long
period of time at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Thus it is
3
suited to the types of samples they analyze in Australia and the
experimental conditions in their laboratory. The results are
critically dependent on the x-ray detector parameters (crystal
diameter, sensitive depth, silicon dead-layer, and the gold electrode
layer), any external detector filters, the x-ray electronics, and even
the target composition (which determines the self-absorption/self-enhancement
effects). The most important step, and perhaps the most
difficult one, is a proper subtraction of the background continuum.
With PIXAN the background can be modelled either by a polynomial (up
to 5th order), or by an iterative method that removes the
characteristic peaks and progressively reduces the spectrum to the
background continuum. We have found that small changes in the
parameters used to model the background leads to large changes in the
final results. We have found that the iterative method works better
than the polynomial method for our samples, and have achieved results
on glass standards that are generally within 20% of the given values
for the elements Na to Pb (see section 4).
The exact experimental uncertainties are hard to determine. The
precision when measuring an element well above the limit of detection
and isolated from any interfering peaks is better than 5%. Elements
found near the limit of detection have greater uncertainties. Elements
with low energy x-rays (less than 2 kev) and high energy x-rays
(greater than 30 kev) have larger uncertainties since the detector
efficiency is quite low and poorly known in these regions. The case of
interfering peaks must be considered individually. For example, the
uncertainty in the measurement of sulfur (Ka = 2.307 kev) depends on
the amount of lead (Ma = 2.346 kev) in the sample. The overall
accuracy of a PIXE measurement depends on the uncertainties in the
following factors: the number of x-rays in a characteristic peak; the
number of incident protons; the detector efficiency; and the
absorption/enhancement corrections. In general, uncertainties of
around 10% - 20% can be expected with PIXE.
Most of the results to date have been determined without seeing
graphically the background or least-squares fit to the spectrum, a
most unfortunate circumstance. Thomas Calligaro has recently written a
program that displays the x-ray spectrum, the background, and the fit
4
of the data, an indispensible step in proper spectrum analysis. Good
spectrum analysis, even with the best computer programs, still
requires experience. One must know what to look for in the background
subtraction, the gaussian fit, the calculation of the sum and escape
peaks, the relative peak intensities, the unfolding of overlapping
peaks, and so forth. One must be careful and not simply accept the
results given by the computer program.
The data files included with PIXAN lacked some vital information
to make it work correctly for the samples we have at the Louvre, and
needed to be supplemented. First of all they did not include any M-line
x-ray data, which are necessary for quantitative results on the
elements Na through Cl (1-3 kev). We have therefore added M-line data
for Pb, Hg, Pt, and Au into the PIXAN data files. (The elements whose
M-line data is important for us to know immediately.) Secondly, the
data file of relative peak heights is appropriate only for 2.5 Mev
protons. The relative peak heights are important to know since PIXAN
uses them to untangle the overlap of peaks. Although the Ka/KB ratio
is independent of energy, the LalLi ratio, (where i is anyone of the
many other L-line x-rays), and the Ma/Mi ratios vary unsystematically
as a function of incident proton energy. Therefore it will be
necessary for us to modify the data tables for energies lower and
higher than 2.5 Mev in order to obtain the most accurate results. (We
will use the tabulated theoretical x-ray cross sections of D.D. Cohen
and M. Harrington, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables 33, 1985, 255-
343.) Thirdly, L- and M-shell sum (pile-up) peaks are not included in
the peak search and are therefore not removed from the x-ray spectra.
The justification for not including the L- and M-shell sum peaks was
to make it easier for PIXAN to determine accurate amounts of Ti
(Ka=4.508 kev) and Ba (La=4.467 kev) when both are present in the
sample. However, L- and M-line pileup peaks are a serious problem when
a sample contains major or minor amounts of platinum, gold, mercury,
lead, tin, or barium.
III. RESULTS
We have acquired 52 PIXE spectra to date: 12 on glass standards,
36 on paint pigments, 3 on ceramic standards, and 10 on gold samples.
5
A. Glass
We have concentrated our efforts on four colored glass samples.
These samples have been well characterized, and they contain 27
elements between Na and Pb in quantities of 100 ppm to 35%. The
elements between Na and K (X-rays between 1 and 3 Kev) are difficult
to determine yet important in archaeometric studies of glass,
pigments, ceramics, and geological samples. In addition these glass
samples are ideal PIXE targets, being completely homogeneous, flat,
and small enough to fit into a vacuum chamber. We felt it was
necessary to get good results on these standards before we started
analyzing unknown targets.
The glass samples were prepared in 1964 by R. H. Brill and A. A.
Erickson of the Corning Glass Works in Corning New York. The four
samples were designed to duplicate the types of glass studied by
archaeologists and art historians. Two samples (known as Brill A and
Brill B) are soda-lime-silica glasses, which are similar to ancient
Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Ionan, Byzantine, and Islamic glasses. One
sample (Brill C) is a glass with high-lead and high-barium levels,
which is similar to glasses from Eastern Asia. The fourth sample
(Brill D) is a potash-lime-silica glass which is similar to certain
medieval glasses and some glasses of the 17th to 19th centuries. Minor
and trace elements were also introduced at levels that are comparable
to those actually found in ancient glasses. The method of fabrication
of these samples is given in R. H. Brill, A Chemical-Analytical Round-robin
on Four Synthetic Glasses, Proceedings of the IX International
Congress on Glass, Versailles 27 September, 1971.
The glass samples are several millimeters long and are embedded
in amber. They were analyzed at 1.0 and 2.5 Mev, with the intention of
obtaining the light elements (Na to Cal at 1.0 Mev, when there is no
detector filter, and the heavy elements (K to Pb) at 2.5 Mev, while
using a detector filter which allows the use of higher beam currents
and better (lower) sensitivity. The spectrum for Brill C at 2.5 Mev is
shown in figure 2 and the best results to date for the glass samples
are given in table 1. The element K was chosen to be an ""internal
6
standard"", so all the results are relative and normalized to the K
concentration. A comparison between the experimental resu",multimedia,962,not included

The work of this group has considered the difficulties encountered in using these combustion modes through implementation of advanced control methodologies, novel sensor techniques as well as expanding usage of fuels such as bio-fuels and hydrogen. The methods used to obtain the lower combustion temperatures include lean mixtures and high levels of exhaust gas recirculation. For example, LTC modes such as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Partially Premixed Compression Ignition (PCCI) engines show real gains in reduced engine out emissions with improved efficiency. However, implementation of these advanced combustion modes presents combustion timing and stability issues due to stronger dependence of these advanced combustion modes on the physical and chemical properties of the fuel, inlet temperature, and inlet composition than traditional diffusion burning (“diesel” type) modes. Progress in these advanced combustion modes requires a “smart” engine capable of sensing heat release patterns and adjusting combustion system parameters. Hence collaborative work between several researchers at Missouri S&T are considering the required combustion analysis, nonlinear control, sensor development and fuel property issues surrounding the implementation of several LTC modes. Analysis methods currently considered are based on surface accelerations for use on both conventional and premixed auto-ignited combustion types that can robustly indicate combustion characteristics. Surface mount accelerometers are being used to indicate combustion characteristics needed for closed loop engine control but which have minimal structural influence. Acceleration frequency bands are being identified where the structural characteristics has the most influence (i.e. structure resonant modes), thereby allowing indication of other surface acceleration frequency bands which are minimally affected by the structure and more indicative of the combustion behavior. Active control necessitates an advanced control strategy such as adaptive neural networks which we have shown can function satisfactorily even when the dynamics of the engine combustion process are unknown. A near optimal nonlinear adaptive controller using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), based on a phenomenological LTC engine model is being developed. The conceived controller would reduce cyclic variability in start-of-combustion, limit pressure rise rates and control to maximize efficiency through control of heat release pattern phasing. With advanced control algorithms, low-cost sensor technologies need to be developed before robust control of auto-ignited combustion can be achieved on a production scale. Interferometer based sensors packaged in small fiber optics are being developed for the high temperature and pressure combustion chamber environment with response times on the order of microseconds. Finally, advancing the application of advanced LTC modes to enable the use of bio-fuels or hydrogen has become increasingly important for energy security. Consequently, the distinct characteristics of hydrogen combustion in engines are being investigated using advanced simulation techniques to examine more efficient and cleaner operating strategies (e.g., dual-fuel operation)",multimedia,963,not included

The choice of a certain use has got necessarily socio-economic implications that make it more or less suitable for that site. For this reason it is important to insert socio-economic analysis within the studies on contaminated site remediation and to implement approaches that calibrate extent and modality of the remediation on the basis of potential uses of the site after it. In particular it is important to provide decision-makers with tools that offer them the possibility to consider also this aspect, in order to support their decisions.The specific aim of the socio-economic module is providing the decision makers with a tool that makes possible to compare the different use destinations, outlining possible scenarios linked to alternative uses of the considered site, on the basis of socio-economic considerations (often founded on theories and methods of the spatial analysis) and of local characteristics. Comparing these scenarios it aims to give indications on which use is more suitable and why. The final objective is just to establish which is the \u201cbest\u201d use for that site. The term \u201cbest\u201d indicates that it is possible to rank the whole different use destinations. This is a typical multicriteria decision making problem and there is not a natural order in a multidimensional space, so it is necessary to find a device to do it. A method to rank them is to define a function from the attribute space in the real line and so obtain a total order induced by the real number one. The scientific literature is reach of several ways to approach this problem. Here we propose a method typical of Artificial Intelligence: a Fuzzy Expert Systems (FES). The final product is a software prototype for the remediation of contaminated sites: DESYRE (DEcision Support sYstem for the REqualification of contaminated sites, www.r3environmental.co.uk/dstdemo/), that represents a useful tool for decision-makers. Entering data, relative to the considered site, the software is able to elaborate them to give back one numerical index for each possible use destination (UD). These indexes represent synthetic and comparable expressions of the socio-economic implications deriving from each UD. In this way the decision-makers can compare the opportunities coming from the different uses and have a synthetic indicator, without losing the whole information. The software works in a very transparent way, so that it is possible to highlight which factors determine the high or low index value",multimedia,966,not included

There is a requirement for machine-learning techniques to learn from historical patterns and predict future activities. There is an increased interest in machine-learning techniques that can provide useful and interesting services in the smart home domain. The areas that machine-learning techniques can help advance are varied and ever-evolving. Predicting and classifying the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) of inhabitants in a smart home environment are key modules to automate smart home devices. Some prominent examples include uses for entertainment, elderly care, healthcare, and security. The abilities of the machine-learning technique to find meaningful spatio-temporal relations of high-dimensional data and to learn from streaming datasets are important requirements.



Recently, the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) theory has been presented as a biologically-inspired machine-learning theory that attempts to mimic the neocortex, the front part of the human brain. The main features of the HTM theory include the ability to learn and predict temporal patterns. The HTM theory and its computational implementation, Cortical Learning Algorithms (CLA), present a potential alternative to traditional machine intelligence. This research aims to apply a new biologically inspired machine intelligence technique based on the HTM theory and its CLA implementation to classify ADLs of inhabitants by analysing data captured from different sensors in a smart home scenario.



This research started by reviewing existing research in classification and prediction of ADLs. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and their application in the context of smart homes has been carried out as a primary research. HTM theory and its implementation the CLA have been studied, and experiments were conducted to identify the weaknesses and limitations of applying the HTM theory and the CLA for activity classification in the smart home environment.



To test and evaluate the performance of a proposed machine intelligence technique, there is a need for a dataset that represents the ADLs in a smart home scenario. Due to the excessive cost of building real smart home datasets and the lack of real datasets from smart homes, to tackle this issue, as a secondary contribution to knowledge, this research used OpenSHS (Open Smart Home Simulator), an open-source, cross-platform 3D smart home simulator. In addition, forty-two ADL datasets, Simulated Activities of Daily Living Dataset (SIMADL) were extracted from the OpenSHS tool and made available publicly.



This research proposes multi-region CLA techniques to learn short- and long-term patterns. Two novel multi-region CLA techniques featuring a multiple spatial pooler and temporal memory regions that incorporate a hash encoder and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier were proposed and applied. While, the hash encoder can deal with multi-dimensional datasets, because of the existing encoders of the standard NuPIC encoders are prepared to deal with a single column or a small number of columns and the MLP classifier was used rather than the classifiers used in the current implementation of CLA to produce meaningful predictions. Additionally, the two novel multi-region CLAs, Parallel Spatio-Temporal Memory Stream (CLA2) and Cascaded Temporal Memories Stream (CLA3) were developed to learn short- and long-term patterns from, streaming datasets. To remove the limitation of memory management of the original CLA that contains one spatial pooler and one temporal memory, the original CLA learns using one memory level, such model learns either short-term or long-term patterns, not both of them. A novel CLA2 was proposed and developed, to cope with learning both shortterm and long-term patterns. CLA2 can learn both short-term and long-term patterns in parallel. CLA2 includes two spatial poolers and two temporal memories to simulate short-term and long-term memories. The number of cells per column was decreased in the first region to learn short-term patterns. In the second region, the number of cells per column was increased to learn long-term patterns and the outputs of both regions were concatenated into one vector. The second proposed algorithm (CLA3) has three regions, one spatial pooler, and three cascaded temporal Memories (TM) regions, where the first region learns smaller features, and the second and third regions are more abstract in order to learn and recognise patterns and concatenates the outputs from all three regions into one vector.



An evaluation and comparison of the proposed algorithms against state-of-the-art supervised machine-learning techniques and the standard CLA for classification was conducted using both the simulated smart home SIMADL dataset, generated using the OpenSHS, and the ARAS dataset, that comprises data captured from real-world activities of residents residing in two houses, the obtained results for the real datasets offered less performance than the synthetic datasets. Because the inhabitants are asked to record their activities manually, it was prone to human errors. The real-world dataset ARAS House A is inconsistent because one of the inhabitants left the house for long period of time, which impacts the performance results. The results of the proposed algorithms for the classification of ADLs show that its performance are promising. For the CLA2, the average overall F-measure for all the synthetic datasets, SIMADL and the real-world datasets, ARAS is 84.88%, while the highest F-measure (86.87%) was achieved by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The (CLA2) has achieved an F-measure of 92.63% for House B of the real-world ARAS dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art classification models. For the CLA3, the average overall F-measure for all the synthetic and real datasets is 84.50% . The proposed algorithms improve the best performance of base-line (standard) CLAs by an average F-measure of 51.81% overall",multimedia,967,not included

Many existing approaches formulate this process as a prediction problem of learning optimal decisions (e.g., server, bitrate, relay) based on observed QoE of recent sessions. While prediction-based mechanisms have shown promising QoE improvements, they are necessarily incomplete as they: (1) suffer from many known biases (e.g., incomplete visibility) and (2) cannot respond to sudden changes (e.g., load changes). Drawing a parallel from machine learning, we argue that data-driven QoE optimization should instead be cast as a real-time exploration and exploitation (E2) process rather than as a prediction problem. Adopting E2 in network applications, however, introduces key architectural (e.g., how to update decisions in real time with fresh data) and algorithmic (e.g., capturing complex interactions between session features vs. QoE) challenges. We present Pytheas, a framework which addresses these challenges using a group-based E2 mechanism. The insight is that application sessions sharing the same features (e.g., IP prefix, location) can be grouped so that we can run E2 algorithms at a per-group granularity. This naturally captures the complex interactions and is amenable to realtime control with fresh measurements. Using an end-to-end implementation and a proof-of-concept deployment in CloudLab, we show that Pytheas improves video QoE over a state-of-the-art prediction-based system by up to 31% on average and 78% on 90th percentile of persession QoE.",multimedia,968,included
,to_check,project-academic,University of Hawaii National Foreign Language Resource Center,01/05/2003 00:00,project-academic,blogs and wikis environments for on line collaboration,project-academic," Language professionals have embraced the world of collaborative opportunities the Internet has introduced. Many tools--e-mail, discussion forums, chat--are by now familiar to many language teachers. Recent innovations--blogs, wikis, and RSS feeds--may be less familiar but offer powerful opportunities for online collaboration for both language professionals and learners. The underlying technology of the new tools is XML (""extensible markup language"") which separates content from formatting, encourages use of meta-data, and enables machine processing of Internet documents. The latter is key in the ability to link automatically disparate documents of interest to individuals or groups. The new collaborative opportunities this enables have led some to consider the growing importance of XML as the signal of the arrival of the second-generation Web. FIRST-GENERATION WEB Asynchronous Tools First-generation tools are far from disappearing from the Internet landscape. E-mail continues to be a viable tool for tandem learning and classroom exchanges. Now that most e-mail programs support formatted text and graphics, e-mail is more attractive and versatile than in the days of plain ASCII. Multimedia can now be embedded directly in messages and non-Roman characters are more easily supported. However, many instructors have increasingly turned to discussion forums as the principal tool for written exchanges among class members. Compared to e-mail, discussion forums facilitate group exchanges, and they maintain automatically a log of all messages in a threaded, hierarchical structure. Some instructors find that students consider language structure somewhat more in contributing to discussion forums (as a form of semi-public display) than in writing e-mail (a quick and easy private and informal system). Discussion forums are often seen as an equalizing tool, which encourage universal participation in discussion compared to face-to-face dialogue. It will be interesting to see whether new voice-based forums such as Wimba change that dynamic. Of course, it is the encouragement of peer-to-peer networking and buddy learning, so central to a constructivist learning approach, which has made discussion forums the mainstay of Web courses in most disciplines. Language teachers have found that students at many different levels benefit from the extra writing done in discussion forums and from its use to communicate meaningfully in real contexts. While dedicated software for creating discussion forums exists (such as WWWBoard), many instructors have access to built-in forum creation in a learning management system (LMS) such as WebCT or Blackboard. Features across the different systems are very similar, although the look and feel may differ significantly. Some dedicated products, such as WebCrossing, offer additional add-ons such as polls, live messaging, and enhanced monitoring. Although most commonly used as part of a class, there are certainly uses of forums outside that setting as well, as in learner participation in native speaker forums. For commonly studied languages, there are on-line forums available on a wide variety of topics, often organized by media outlets or interest groups. As one recent study of their use by language learners points out, students need to approach such forums with a good understanding of the conventions used and of the cultural dynamics at work. Synchronous Tools Language learners face even more the issue of knowing rules and conventions when entering chat rooms, whether they be a variation of a MOO or just a generic, text-based chat. Often there are shortcuts and etiquette, which can prove confusing and frustrating to new users. Nevertheless, some language teachers have embraced the use of chat as an effective communication tool. The speed of chat exchanges forces short, spontaneous messages, which more closely mimic spoken exchanges than is the case in discussion forums. …",multimedia,969,not included
,to_check,core,,01/01/2020 00:00,core,γεωπονικό πανεπιστήμιο αθηνών,Big data analytics in agricultural digital markets,"Nowadays, a lot of companies aim to tap into social media networking in order to maximize their profit by endorsing their products or services and for improving their brands’ names. The development of Web 2.0 has permitted Internet users to post, share and exchange their own self-generated opinions or thoughts on various topics on different websites. A large amount of data containing useful information concerning the consumers’ preferences is generated from a variety of sources such as reviews, posts, microblogs or online digital markets. In the case of Food and Beverage (F&B) sector, more and more review websites are established globally (Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.) and most of them allow users to digitally make their own orders for delivery, or take away goods (just eat, etc.), as well as to digitally evaluate about the products or services that they have consumed. The produced information (evaluations) which is generated rapidly can be large and generally modifies consumers’ behavior. It is also notable that the e-evaluations could be characterized as mixed-documents, because users evaluate different companies’ functions at the same time. However, in most of the cases, the involved stakeholders (companies or customers) cannot mine and analyze in real time the useful information that is created due to the lack of resources and  humans’ physical or mental restrictions.In bibliography, there are various methodologies to face this problem, with the sentiment analysis being the preferred one. It is presented as the automatic detection of positive or negative expressions in user generated content. Also, in research there are two approaches: the machine learning approach and the semantic orientation approach and three levels of analysis: the document-level, the sentence-level and the aspect-level. A lot of frameworks have already proposed that use machine learning techniques, while the semantic orientation approach has not received the same interest yet. However, some previous researches concluded that the semantic orientation approach may be more efficient when implemented for classifying users’ opinions and for determining the polarity and the strength of opinions at the same time. Finally, while a lot has been written and researched about sentiment analysis in various domains and languages too, the F&B sector in the Greek language has drawn limited researchers’ attention. This study faces this problem by making a suggestion of a new hybrid framework of sentiment analysis using the semantic orientation approach. A thorough analysis of 91,504 customers’ reviews (9,150 reviews in the training set) collected from an e-ordering platform of some F&B companies distributed in almost all prefectures of Greece is occurred. After, the implementation of some well-known models and metrics in the training set (BOW, tf-idf and POS) resulted in the creation of an opinion dictionary concerning the F&B domain. The dictionary consists of three sub-dictionaries that correspond to three companies’ functions (quality of food, customer service and image of the company). Further, after the implementation of the PMI metric in the training set, the relationships between the parts of the speech and their positions in mixed customers’ e-valuations are identified and used for constructing the proposed patterns of tags. The patterns of tags are then used for detecting and quantifying the customers’ opinions per function in a review. The main innovation of this framework is based on the form of the analysis, first at sentence and after at aspect-level. Also, a new hybrid technique for constructing opinion dictionaries is proposed, using all the known techniques that are presented in bibliography (manually-technique, corpus-based technique and dictionary-based technique). Finally, since the extraction of useful information from the user generated content must usually be held in real-time in order to facilitate the stakeholders to make smart decisions on-time, a web-based system that able to mine and analyze customers’ evaluations in almost real-time, is introduced. For this, two modules will be designed and implemented. The first is a web scraping module for mining the reviews from all e-ordering platforms and the second is a module for implementing the proposed hybrid framework.Based on the confusion matrix of the designed sets, the well-known performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score were computed. The results showed a remarkable high performance on the sentiment classification and the aspect-level analysis respectively. Specifically, the proposed hybrid framework showed an average accuracy of 98.45% in the training set concerning the sentiment classification. Moreover, it showed an average accuracy of 93.61% in the annotated set concerning the aspect-analysis. Then, for the purposes of assessing the framework in a big set of customers’ reviews, it tested in the data set and it showed an extremely high average accuracy of 90.69%. However, in all designed sets were calculated lower values in negative predictions, mainly due to the identification difficulties of negation and sarcasm, in natural language texts. In more detail, the framework showed an average recall of 85.99% in negative predictions against of 99.43% in positive predictions in the training set, an average recall of 81.49% in negative predictions against of 96.43% in positive predictions in the annotated set and an average recall of 70.81% in negative predictions against of 95.79% in positive predictions in the data set. It is noteworthy that the performance of negative prediction remains at a high level, comparable to other similar researches. The average high values of the metrics lead us to conclude that the vast majority of aspects that described the examined functions in the F&B sector with the semantic orientation terms (adjectives) that con-currently occur, were detected. To conclude, a new technique for managing the instances that cannot be detected and evaluated by the system is proposed.Τη σημερινή εποχή, πολλές επιχειρήσεις χρησιμοποιούν τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης με σκοπό να βελτιώσουν την επωνυμία τους και να μεγιστοποιήσουν τα κέρδη τους, μέσω της προβολής των αγαθών τους (προϊόντα ή υπηρεσίες). Η ανάπτυξη του Παγκόσμιου Ιστού 2.0 έχει επιτρέψει στους χρήστες να μεταφορτώνουν, να διαμοιράζονται και να ανταλλάζουν τις απόψεις ή τις ιδέες τους για διάφορα θέματα σε μια πληθώρα ιστοτόπων. Παράγεται, όπως είναι κατανοητό, ένας μεγάλος όγκος δεδομένων που περιέχει χρήσιμες πληροφορίες σχετικά με τις προτιμήσεις των καταναλωτών και από ποίκιλες πηγές, όπως μικρο-ιστολόγια, αξιολογήσεις σε ψηφιακές αγορές ή ιστοτόπους συζητήσεων κ.ά. Στην περίπτωση του αγροδιατροφικού κλάδου και κατ’ επέκταση της Εστίασης και Ποτών (Ε&Π), όλο και περισσότεροι ιστότοποι αξιολογήσεων λειτουργούν παγκοσμίως (Yelp, TripAdvisor κ.ά.) και πολλοί από αυτούς επιτρέπουν στους χρήστες να πραγματοποιούν ηλεκτρονικά τις παραγγελίες τους για τη διανομή στο σπίτι έτοιμου φαγητού (Volton, just-eat, e-food κ.ά.). Επίσης, οι χρήστες έχουν τη δυνατότητα να αξιολογούν δημόσια τα αγαθά που έχουν καταναλώσει. Όπως γίνεται αντιληπτό, παράγεται ταχύτατα ένας μεγάλος όγκος χρήσιμων πληροφορίων από τις ηλεκτρονικές αξιολογήσεις χρηστών στο Διαδίκτυο που μπορεί να επηρεάσει άλλους και να μεταβάλει την καταναλωτική τους συμπεριφορά. Αξίζει να σημειωθεί ότι οι ηλεκτρονικές αξιολογήσεις του κλάδου χαρακτηρίζονται ως μικτές, επειδή αξιολογούνται ταυτόχρονα διαφορετικές λειτουργίες ενός καταστήματος. Έτσι, τα ενδιαφερόμενα μέρη (επιχειρήσεις ή καταναλωτές) δεν είναι σε θέση να εξάγουν και να αναλύουν σε πραγματικό χρόνο τις χρήσιμες πληροφορίες που παράγονται, εξαιτίας της έλλειψης πόρων και των βιολογικών και διανοητικών περιορισμών του ανθρώπινου παράγοντα. Στη βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζονται διάφορες μεθοδολογίες που αντιμετωπίζουν το συγκεκριμένο πρόβλημα με την ανάλυση συναισθήματος να είναι η προτιμότερη. Απαντάται ως η αυτόματη ανακάλυψη θετικών ή αρνητικών εκφράσεων σε περιεχόμενο που δημιουργείται από τους χρήστες των κοινωνικών δικτύων. Ερευνητικά παρουσιάζονται δύο προσεγγίσεις: η προσέγγιση της μηχανικής μάθησης και η προσέγγιση του σημασιολογικού προσανατολισμού. Επίσης παρουσιάζονται τρία επίπεδα ανάλυσης: το επίπεδο κειμένου, το επίπεδο πρότασης και το επίπεδο απόψεων. Αρκετά πλαίσια έχουν προταθεί που χρησιμοποιούν τεχνικές μηχανικής μάθησης, ενώ δεν παρουσιάζεται το ίδιο ενδιαφέρον για την προσέγγιση του σημασιολογικού προσανατολισμού. Ωστόσο, προηγούμενες έρευνες κατέληξαν στο συμπέρασμα ότι η προσέγγιση του σημασιολογικού προσανατολισμού θεωρείται αποδοτικότερη, όταν εφαρμόζεται για να ταξινομήσει τις απόψεις των χρηστών και ταυτόχρονα να υπολογίσει την ισχύ των απόψεων αυτών μέσω της ποσοτικοποίησης τους. Τέλος, ενώ αρκετές έρευνες έχουν διεξαχθεί σχετικά με την ανάλυση συναισθήματος σε διάφορες γλώσσες και κλάδους, η ελληνική και ειδικά ο κλάδος Ε&Π έχουν λάβει ελάχιστα την προσοχή του επιστημονικού κοινού. Αυτό οφείλεται κυρίως στο γεγονός ότι η ελληνική θεωρείται μια γλώσσα πολλών διακυμάνσεων με περίπλοκους γραμματικούς και συντακτικούς κανόνες. Η παρούσα διατριβή αντιμετωπίζει το πρόβλημα που περιγράφηκε, προτείνοντας ένα νέο πλαίσιο ανάλυσης συναισθήματος, εφαρμόζοντας την προσέγγιση του σημασιολογικού προσανατολισμού. Μέσω της εμπεριστατωμένης ανάλυσης 91.504 πραγματικών αξιολογήσεων πελατών (9.150 αξιολογήσεις στο σύνολο εκπαίδευσης) που εξορύχθηκαν από επιχειρήσεις που λειτουργούν σε όλη την Ελληνική επικράτεια, καθώς και με τη χρήση των κατάλληλων μέτρων και προτύπων (BOW, tf-idf, POS), κατασκευάζεται ένα λεξικό απόψεων που αναφέρεται στον κλάδο Ε&Π. Το προτεινόμενο λεξικό περιλαμβάνει τρία υπο-λεξικά που αντιστοιχούν στις λειτουργίες των καταστημάτων του κλάδου (ποιότητα φαγητού, εξυπηρέτηση & εικόνα καταστήματος). Στη συνέχεια, μέσω της εφαρμογής του προτύπου αμοιβαίας πληροφόρησης (PMI), εντοπίζονται οι σχέσεις των μερών του λόγου, καθώς και οι θέσεις τους στις μικτές αξιολογήσεις των πελατών και προτείνονται τα αντίστοιχα μοτίβα ετικετών, τα οποία χρησιμοποιούνται στη συνέχεια, με σκοπό να εντοπιστούν και να ποσοτικοποιηθούν οι απόψεις των χρηστών. Η καινοτομία του πλαισίου βασίζεται στη μορφή της ανάλυσης, πρώτα σε επίπεδο πρότασης και έπειτα σε επίπεδο απόψεων, με σκοπό να εξαχθούν και να ποσοτικοποιηθούν αυτόματα οι απόψεις για τις διαφορετικές λειτουργίες ενός καταστήματος. Επιπλέον, προτείνεται μια νέα υβριδική τεχνική κατασκευής λεξικών απόψεων, κάνοντας χρήση και των τριών τεχνικών που προτείνονται στη βιβλιογραφία (μηχανική τεχνική, τεχνική βασισμένη σε σώμα, τεχνική βασισμένη σε λεξικό). Τέλος, δεδομένου ότι η εξαγωγή των χρήσιμων πληροφοριών που παράγεται από το περιεχόμενο που δημιουργείται από τους χρήστες, πρέπει να λαμβάνει χώρα σε πραγματικό χρόνο, ώστε να διευκολύνει τα ενδιαφερόμενα μέρη να λάβουν ορθές αποφάσεις, κατασκευάστηκε ένα διαδικτυακό σύστημα εξόρυξης και ανάλυσης αξιολογήσεων πελατών σε σχεδόν πραγματικό χρόνο. Το σύστημα περιλαμβάνει δύο αρθρώματα: το άρθρωμα ιστο-συγκομιδής, που χρησιμοποιείται για να εξάγει τις ηλεκτρονικές αξιολογήσεις των πελατών από όλες τις σχετικές πλατφόρμες του κλάδου και το άρθρωμα εφαρμογής του προτεινόμενου υβριδικού πλαισίου ανάλυσης συναισθήματος. Βασιζόμενοι στις μήτρες σύγχυσης των συνόλων δεδομένων που κατασκευάστηκαν, υπολογίστηκαν τα γνωστά μέτρα αποδοτικότητας της ακριβείας, της ευστοχίας, της ανάκλησης και του F1-στόχου, τα οποία παρουσίασαν μια υψηλή αποδοτικότητα του προτεινόμενου υβριδικού πλαισίου, τόσο στην ταξινόμηση συναισθήματος, όσο και στην ανάλυση σε επίπεδο απόψεων. Συγκεκριμένα, το μέσο μέτρο ακριβείας στο σύνολο εκπαίδευσης σχετικά με την ταξινόμηση συναισθήματος υπολογίστηκε σε 98,45%. Επίσης, το αντίστοιχο μέτρο ακριβείας στο σχολιασμένο σύνολο σχετικά με την ταξινόμηση σε επίπεδο απόψεων υπολογίστηκε σε 93,61%. Στη συνέχεια, με σκοπό να αξιολογηθεί η αποδοτικότητα του πλαισίου σε ένα μεγάλο σύνολο αξιολογήσεων, δοκιμάστηκε στο σύνολο δεδομένων, οπότε και διαπιστώθηκε ένα εξαιρετικά υψηλό μέσο μέτρο ακριβείας ίσο με 90,69%. Ωστόσο, σε όλα τα προαναφερόμενα σύνολα παρουσιάστηκαν χαμηλότερα μέτρα αποδοτικότητας για τις αρνητικές προβλέψεις, κυρίως λόγω των δυσκολιών αναγνώρισης της άρνησης και του σαρκασμού σε κείμενα της φυσικής γλώσσας. Αναλυτικότερα, το μέσο μέτρο ανάκλησης για τις αρνητικές προβλέψεις στο σύνολο εκπαίδευσης υπολογίστηκε σε 85,99% έναντι του 99,43% στις θετικές προβλέψεις, στο σχολιασμένο σύνολο σε 81,49% έναντι του 96,43% και στο σύνολο δεδομένων σε 70,81% έναντι του 95,79%. Είναι άξιο προσοχής ότι η αποδοτικότητα της αρνητικής πρόβλεψης παραμένει σε υψηλά επίπεδα, συγκρίσιμη με άλλες παρεμφερείς έρευνες. Οι υψηλές μέσες τιμές των μέτρων μας οδήγησαν στο συμπέρασμα ότι η μεγαλύτερη πλειοψηφία των καταχωρήσεων απόψεων (ουσιαστικά), που περιγράφουν τις εξεταζόμενες λειτουργίες ενός καταστήματος στον κλάδο Ε&Π με τους αντίστοιχους όρους σημασιολογικού προσανατολισμού (επίθετα) που συνυπάρχουν, εντοπίστηκαν ορθά. Τέλος, προτείνεται μια νέα τεχνική διαχείρισης των κειμένων με ασάφειες, που συνήθως δεν αξιολογούνται από τα συστήματα ανάλυσης συναισθήματος, αφού δεν συμπεριλαμβάνονται στις μήτρες σύγχυσης, με αποτέλεσμα να μην επηρεάζουν τα αντίστοιχα μέτρα αποδοτικότητας. Η προτεινόμενη τεχνική επέφερε μέση μείωση 8,27% στους δείκτες αποδοτικότητας της αρνητικής πρόβλεψης και μέση μείωση 2,34% στους δείκτες αποδοτικότητας της θετικής πρόβλεψης",science,970,not included

Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the waterlogged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the timeconsuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect. Manual extraction of image features could be automated in the future through the use of deep-learning algorithms",science,971,not included

One of these challenges is the modelling of the complex interaction that audio and visual stimuli have and how this interaction is interpreted by human users. The No-Reference Audio-Visual Quality Metric Based on a Deep Autoencoder (NAViDAd) deals with this problem from a machine learning perspective. The metric receives two sets of audio and video features descriptors and produces a low-dimensional set of features used to predict the audio-visual quality. A basic implementation of NAViDAd was able to produce accurate predictions tested with a range of different audio-visual databases. The current work performs an ablation study on the base architecture of the metric. Several modules are removed or re-trained using different configurations to have a better understanding of the metric functionality. The results presented in this study provided important feedback that allows us to understand the real capacity of the metric's architecture and eventually develop a much better audio-visual quality metric.Science Foundation IrelandInsight Research CentreConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientfico eTecnol ogico (CNPq)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nıvel Superior (CAPES)Fundacao de Apoio aPesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)University of Brasılia (UnB)2020-12-15 JG: external PDF cover page remove",science,972,not included

machine learning problems, its per-iteration computation time is limited by the
straggling workers. Straggling workers can be tolerated by assigning redundant
computations and coding across data and computations, but in most existing
schemes, each non-straggling worker transmits one message per iteration to the
parameter server (PS) after completing all its computations. Imposing such a
limitation results in two main drawbacks; over-computation due to inaccurate
prediction of the straggling behaviour, and under-utilization due to treating
workers as straggler/non-straggler and discarding partial computations carried
out by stragglers. In this paper, to overcome these drawbacks, we consider
multi-message communication (MMC) by allowing multiple computations to be
conveyed from each worker per iteration, and design straggler avoidance
techniques accordingly. Then, we analyze how the proposed designs can be
employed efficiently to seek a balance between the computation and
communication latency to minimize the overall latency. Furthermore, through
extensive simulations, both model-based and real implementation on Amazon EC2
servers, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of these designs in
different settings, and demonstrate that MMC can help improve upon existing
straggler avoidance schemes.Comment: This paper was presented in part at the 2019 IEEE International

A blind quality control (BQC) is intended to appear as a real case to the analyst to remove any intentional or subconscious bias. A BQC program allows a real-time assessment of the laboratory’s policies and procedures and monitors reliability of casework. In September 2015, the Houston Forensic Science Center (HFSC) began a BQC program in blood alcohol analysis. Between September 2015 and July 2018, HFSC submitted 317 blind cases: 89 negative samples and 228 positive samples at five target concentrations (0.08, 0.15, 0.16, 0.20 and 0.25 g/100 mL; theoretical targets). These blood samples were analyzed by a headspace gas chromatograph interfaced with dual-flame ionization detectors (HS-GC-FID). All negative samples produced `no ethanol detected’ results. The mean (range) of reported blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) for the aforementioned target concentrations was 0.075 (0.073–0.078), 0.144 (0.140–0.148), 0.157 (0.155–0.160), 0.195 (0.192–0.200) and 0.249 (0.242–0.258) g/100 mL, respectively. The average BAC percent differences from the target for the positive blind cases ranged from −0.4 to −6.3%, within our uncertainty of measurement (8.95–9.18%). The rate of alcohol evaporation/degradation was determined negligible. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to compare the % difference in BAC among five target concentrations, eight analysts, three HS-GC-FID instruments and two pipettes. The variables other than target concentrations showed no significant difference (P \u3e 0.2). While the 0.08 g/100 mL target showed a significantly larger % difference than higher target concentrations (0.15–0.25 g/100 mL), the % differences among the higher targets were not concentration-dependent.

In the age of new media, increasingly characterized by the spread of fake news (AGCOM 2018), new communication “places”, such as institutional sites, blogs and social media, are becoming real reference points, not only in the collecting and diffusion of technical-scientific information for specialists (Martinelli et al. 2017), but also for those who previously had not come into direct contact with specific topics and are faced now with an excessive volume of data (Pellegrini, Rubin 2017). As a result, in the so-called ""Dr. Google Era"" the issue of public communication of science and health news becomes crucial, especially in a context characterized by a growing attention to the reliability of sources and the truthfulness of information. In this scenario, public authorities, in the broadest sense of the term, are called upon to face one of the most difficult challenges they have had to face so far:Public Engagement with Science and Technology (Greco, Pitrelli 2009; Scamuzzi, De Bortoli 2012). In the academic context, this approach recalls the two ""classic"" missions of the University as a social actor, namely education and research, and more immediately refers to the so-called ""Third Mission"" (ANVUR 2014). It is interesting to pay attention on two fundamental elements: (i) the role played by the medical faculties in these processes, as public bodies responsible for education and research in the field of biomedical studies par excellence; (ii) the implementation practices with which these educational institutions carry out the third mission and, therefore, can find legitimacy and be easily recognized by users. For these reasons, we will first analyse the Public Engagement activities carried out by the Italian medical faculties. Secondly, through a comparative analysis with the best practices, we will proceed to identify the set of specific measures in a perspective of future evaluation of quality and academic research, in order to build a possible model of Public Engagement for the medical faculties.

Il campo di intervento è quello dell'Edilizia Residenziale Pubblica, dove, nelle recenti costruzioni, in numerosi casi si riscontra, dal punto di vista tecnico, un elevato standard della qualità abitativa, dal punto di vista sociale, un'interessante varietà di tipologie di nuclei familiari (per consistenza numerica, modalità aggregativa, appartenenza culturale), entrambe caratteristiche che fanno dell'ERP un luogo stimolante per la ricerca.

Nel settore ERP convergono diversi attori. La ricerca si occupa del processo di conoscenza che coinvolge ognuno di essi (progettisti, tecnici di enti proprietari e di gestione, tecnici delle imprese di costruzione), con particolare attenzione alle persone che abitano negli alloggi. Di fatto, per ottenere risultati efficaci rispetto agli investimenti sostenuti, si presenta la necessità che gli inquilini assumano comportamenti consapevoli: per questo, la ricerca prospetta l'introduzione di nuovi attori, quali studenti (supportati dai loro insegnanti) che frequentano l'ultimo anno degli Istituti secondari superiori ad indirizzo tecnico, ai quali affidare il ruolo di formatori degli inquilini attraverso momenti di incontro da ripetere nel tempo.

La ricerca prevede l'ideazione dell'Applicazione ASA (Approccio Sostenibile all'Abitare), personalizzata per ogni alloggio ed edificio considerato attraverso il lavoro comune di studenti e inquilini; i dati sono quelli raccolti e trasferiti da un attore all'altro in tappe precedenti della ricerca.

Si descrivono le caratteristiche che la rendono utilizzabile come strumento di conoscenza e gestione per la propria abitazione, per ottenere risparmio nel rispetto delle condizioni di benessere; si illustrano aspetti che consentono di impiegarla per la gestione degli spazi comuni e del verde, per un miglioramento delle relazioni sociali. 

Pensata per essere messa a disposizione su iPad, accessibile a tutti gli inquilini in uno spazio comune dell'edificio dove si svolgono i momenti di formazione, ASA è scaricabile su dispositivi personali mobili. 

Tra i risultati della ricerca, si presenta una schematizzazione dei passaggi logici che costituiscono il processo dinamico dell'App. Si delineano i vantaggi economici e sociali per i diversi attori.

In un passaggio successivo, la ricerca passerà alla fase operativa, in cui gli inquilini potranno utilizzare l'App ASA anche per dialogare tra di loro e con i tecnici addetti alla gestione. Ulteriori sviluppi porteranno alla formazione della Community (ASA), che farà dialogare tra di loro tutti gli attori.This research project introduces an innovative tool promoting participatory processes for building sustainability. The action area is the Public Housing system where most recent buildings now show both a high technical standard and a captivating social variety of family households (including number of members, aggregations, cultural identity) – both characteristics making Public Housing an interesting research topic.

Different players are involved in a Public Housing system. This research deals with their specific knowledge process, with special attention paid to tenants. As a matter of fact, to get efficient outcomes against the investments made, tenants are needed to engage in responsible behaviors. This research envisages calling in new players, such as senior students from technical high schools who would be trained by their teachers to achieve a focused technical, psychological and pedagogical expertise. Students would then act as trainers themselves and coach the tenants through meetings scheduled over the time.

An Application called ASA as Sustainable Housing Approach will be designed to include the information provided by the tenants about their family households and housing units during the coaching sessions and collected by the student-coaches.  Data used will be that collected and transferred from a player to another in prior research phases.  The characteristics of the ASA as a knowledge and management tool intended to improve savings and wellbeing are described. The points whereby the ASA can be used for effectively managing common areas and green spaces to ease the social interactions are explained too.

Available on iPad and accessible to all tenants in the training environment, the ASA can be downloaded to mobile devices. 

The logical steps making up the ASA’s dynamic process are outlined and a real data simulation is proposed. The economic and social benefits for the different players are outlined as well.

Thanks to future developments of the ASA, tenants will be able to interact with each other and with the housing management institute’s experts. Further implementation of this App will lead to the creation of an ASA Community, allowing all players to interact",science,978,not included
,to_check,core,Iowa State University Digital Repository,01/01/2019 00:00,core,"deep learning for human engineered systems: weak supervision, interpretability and knowledge embedding",,"Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering while machine learning developed from computer science. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming field with many practical applications and active research topics that deals with both pattern recognition and machine learning. We now use software and applications to automate routine labor, understand speech (using Natural Language Processing) or images (extracting hierarchical features and patterns for object detection and pattern recognition), make diagnoses in medicine, even intricate surgical procedures and support basic scientific research.
This thesis deals with exploring the application of a specific branch of AI, or a specific tool, Deep Learning (DL) to real world engineering problems which otherwise had been difficult to solve using existing methods till date. Here we focus on different Deep Learning based methods to deal with several such problems. We also explore the inner workings of such models through an explanation stage for each of the applied DL based strategies that gives us a sense of how such typical black box models work, or as we call it, an explanation stage for the DL model.
This explanation framework is an important step as previously, Deep Learning based models were thought to be frameworks which produce good results (classification, object detection, object recognition to name a few), but with no explanations or immediately visible causes as to why it achieves the results it does. This made Deep Learning based models hard to trust amongst the scientific community. In this thesis, we aim to achieve just that by deploying such explanation frameworks, which will be discussed later in the subsequent chapters. We use one such explanation framework to develop a surrogate model to predict properties of microstructures as well.
Furthermore, we dig deep into the realm of semi-supervised or weakly supervised learning which utilizes minimal data for its training phase and develop a novel framework capable of accurately predicting yields of crops like sorghum. We utilize this framework to learn from available data in an online fashion, annotate new data, significantly reduce manual annotation time and at the same time predict crop yield, a first of its kind within the target application domain.
We also propose a new generative modeling approach, Surrogate Invariance Network (S-InvNet), that can efficiently model data spaces with known invariances. We devise an adversarial training algorithm to encode such invariances into the data distribution. We validate our framework by reconstructing two-phase microstructures with desired physical properties. The physical properties are governed by a data-driven surrogate model which acts as the invariance for our case. In essence, we fuse a generative and a classification model with the classification model acting as an invariance checker that enforces the property of the target microstructure.
How a Deep Learning model can iteratively solve a non-linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based on a given set of initial conditions and using a Physics-governed loss function (instead of traditional loss functions used to optimize Deep Learning models) is presently an area of great research interest. We explore this as well. Previous literature deal with utilizing a single loss function to solve such examples of PDE-governed systems. Moreover, the most recent work proposes to solve only a simple spatially varying PDE (Darcy Flow). We extend the framework to deal with both spatial and time-varying PDEs (Burgers\u27 Equation). Furthermore, we also propose an alternating minimization process for optimizing neural networks as PDE-solvers. This alternatively minimizes two separate loss functions. We note that this process works just as well as the single loss minimization and in certain cases, performs even better. From a neural network standpoint, we use a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder framework as our PDE-surrogate",science,979,not included

In order to fulfil this objective, methodologies developed or improved in WP3 were applied in the JRAPs;the provision of data assembled and distributed was undertaken according to the WP5 recommendations; dedicated topical approaches of the scientific strategy matured jointly with WP1&4 (Deliverable D4.1) were applied within the JRAPs, providing then in return essential input to the future road map of the research infrastructures. Indeed, six JRAPs were implemented to address different key environmental issues and/or policy needs such as those considered by the MSFD, and according to the 6 JERICO-NEXT scientific areas:
1- JRAP#1 on pelagic biodiversity
2- JRAP#2 on benthic biodiversity
3- JRAP#3 on chemical contaminant occurrence and related biological responses
4- JRAP#4 on hydrography and transport
5- JRAP#5 on carbon fluxes and carbonate system
6- JRAP#6 on operational oceanography and forecasting.
These JRAPs were not intending to implement similar actions at each JERICO-RI site but only to a selection of sites/regions according to the consortium interests and requirements from local to regional scales. Consequently, it is paramount to regionally synthesize the preliminary results after deployments in JRAPs, which is the purpose of this document.
The main document is organised according to the following regions and sites:
	- Bay of Biscay (South East Bay of Biscay, Portuguese Margin and Nazaré Canyon,  Girond Mud patch and Bay of Brest)
	- Channel and North Sea
	- Kattegat and Skagerrak Sea
	- Baltic Sea
	- Norwegian Sea
	- Med. Sea: From Liguria to the Ibiza Channel
	- Med. Sea: Northern Adriatic Sea
	- Med. Sea: Cretan Sea.
Results for those regions are presented in chapter 3 after consideration of the regional or site specificities related to the most relevant scientific issues of the area and the most relevant societal and policy needs, respectively. As the project and the JRAPs were not a priori organised to fit with regional to local needs, the reader may identify a weak point in the way JERICO-NEXT is addressing scientific syntheses per region. Nevertheless, it is a preliminary work towards the regional structuration of the RI, as expected, and a significant effort was put forth to identify discrepancies in the level of regional integration, and the recommended way to progress on this issue is presented in Chapter 4.
 
Synthesis of main achievements per region of JERICO-RI
Bay of Biscay: SE BoB
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1 3 4 6
	- Progress in the study of coastal small scale and mesoscale features from the combined use of multiplatform in-situ and satellite data.
	- Progress in the application of innovative techniques (developed in WP3) in this area for data-gap filling, data-blending, advanced Lagrangian diagnostics and performing observing system experiments (OSEs) and observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs).
	- Success in the gathering of new high-resolution datasets from different surveys and actions in the area (ETOILE with MASTODON-2D moorings deployment and TNA BB-TRANS).
 
Bay of Biscay: Gironde and Bay of Brest
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAP #2
	- Success in gathering biological and biogeochemical observations on a major marine mudpatch located in a high energetic environment. New evidence on the major role of hydrodynamics in controlling benthic diversity and associated biogeochemical processes in this mudpatch.
	- Success in deriving high resolution spatial maps of clam dredging pressure in the Bay of Brest and in using these maps to show the deleterious effect of this activity on benthic diversity hosted by maerl beds.
	- Success in the field testing of several techniques and tools (e.g., Image acquisition via mobile platforms and sediment profiling, image processing via dedicated software, and O2 sediment microprofiling) developed within both JERICO-FP7 and JERICO-NEXT.
 
Bay of Biscay: Nazare Canyon
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #4 & 6
	- Success in the implementation of a high-resolution model with data assimilation able to describe the energetic dynamics and coastal ocean impacts of this long submarine canyon.
	- Progress in understanding the crucial importance of real-time monitoring infrastructures (fixed platforms, HF radars) to the characterization and operational forecasting of coastal ocean areas marked by the presence of submarine canyons, view the energetic and short spatial scale processes that are associated with these topographic features and the impacts canyons promote on larger domains of the coastal ocean. 
	- Progress in understanding the dominant processes of subinertial dynamics in the Nazare Canyon area of influence, contributing to define the main components of a real-time monitoring system for this area.
 
Channel and North Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 4, 5
	- Successful implementation of innovative (semi-)automated techniques for the monitoring of phytoplankton dynamics and C cycle in the English Channel and the North Sea  - an extended shelf system influenced by multiple sources of human pressure and contrasting hydrodynamical conditions
	- Some of these methods were compared with traditional laboratory analysis which helped to better address the added value of innovative techniques in terms of improving the spatial and temporal resolution (both in surface and in the water column), making it possible to consider functional and, sometimes, even taxonomical characterization of phytoplankton communities composition as well as photo-physiology, at high  resolution, in almost real-time.
	- New insights into the seasonality of the spatial distribution of delta partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) measured continuously on ships of opportunity at a regional scale in the North Sea, and the relation between marine sinks of CO2 with high total chlorophyll a fluorescence.
	- Automated techniques made it possible to characterize the size and functional composition of phytoplankton communities (from pico- to microphytoplankton) through the main bloom episodes including outburst of potential HABs as Pseudo-nitszchia spp. and Phaeocystis globosa (characterized as high or low red fluorescence nano-eukaryotes: Nano high and Low FLR) from the Eastern English Channel (EEC) towards the southern North Sea, in international cross-border (UK, FR, BE, NL) common research cruises, following the spatial and temporal succession of spring blooms.
	- There is a need to increase the combined implementation of innovative and reference techniques both on current monitoring of discrete stations as well as in continuous automated measurements performed on cruises and ships of opportunity (as FerryBoxes), in order to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the surveys of the different eco-hydrodynamic regions of the area.
 
Kattegat and Skagerrak
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 3, 5, 6
	-  Harmful algae, phytoplankton diversity and abundance were observed in near real time at an aquaculture site on the Swedish west coast. In situ imaging flow cytometry combined with machine learning and wireless communications provided data every 20 minutes.
	- Data from HF radar, FerryBox, research vessels and oceanographic buoys were used together with results from the 3D-NEMO Nordic ocean circulation model and remote sensing to describe the Kattegat-Skagerrak system.
	- Data from a FerryBox system revealed, as expected, the occurrence of strong concentration gradients reflecting progressive dilution along the South-North transect and highlighted harbours areas (Oslo and Kiel) as hotspots for some chemical compounds.
	- Microbial molecular markers representing bacterial species and genes were used to identify hydrocarbon pollution or high nutrient loads.
	- Barcoding of phytoplankton and bacteria revealed previously unknown diversity in the pelagic communities (see deliverable D3.8).
	- Carbon fluxes and carbonate system variability in the Skagerrak/Kattegat region is primarily driven by changes in salinity resulting from the balance of freshwater inputs from riverine and Baltic sources and saline waters from the Atlantic Ocean.
 
Baltic
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 5, 6
	- Different technologies for phytoplankton research have been successfully evaluated in the Baltic Sea. Operational monitoring of phycoerythrin fluorescence started after in-depth study during JRAP1, which identified different origins of this signal. To study filamentous cyanobacteria blooms, various sensors were tested and they were largely complementary. New absorption method seems to provide reliable estimates for Chlorophyll-a concentration, but still lacks automated maintenance procedures. Better understanding was obtained on the range of conversion factor between electron transport rate (measured with fluorescence induction) and carbon fixation rate, as well as of the reasons behind this variability. 
	- Carbonate system components of the Baltic Sea showed large seasonal variability indicating high impact of biological activity for pH and pCO2. Alkalinity of the Baltic Sea is difficult to model from other carbonate system components and online sensors are required to understand its variability.
	- The joint studies between different (multinational) research groups using different technologies provided good know-how exchange and should be encouraged. As well, multidisciplinary research efforts, including physics, chemistry, biology and modelling, should be encouraged, to gain knowledge on the environmental challenges more in detail. 
 
Norwegian Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 3, 6
	- The Norwegian Sea plays a major role as an area where potentially highly polluted waters from the North Sea mix with water transported from the North Atlantic Ocean. This water is then transported into the Arctic region. Analysis of the transport pathway of waterborne contaminants along the Norwegian coast was instrumental for assessing the spatial range of contaminants with different properties and address questions regarding exposure of the Arctic.
	- 42 currently used pesticides in Europe, 5 artificial sweeteners and 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products were targeted during the study. Several compounds were detected in the Norwegian Sea, including current use pesticides, artificial food additives and some pharmaceuticals. Their presence in this coastal area, and also in high-latitude more open waters, highlight the potential for these contaminants to undergo long range transport with marine currents.
	- Seasonal variability in temperature in the coastal area (up to a 15 ˚C differential between summer and winter depending on latitude) is a large driving force on carbonate system variability, including a decrease in surface water fCO2 due to lower wintertime temperatures as well as the uptake of atmospheric CO2 as water cools during its northward journey from the North Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean.
	- In addition, a focal point was the improvement of systems that provides knowledge for the transport of parasites and harmful algae in the Norwegian Sea coastal area. Here the observations by FerryBoxes, fixed stations as well as repeated transects were used to validate and improve numerical model simulations.
 
Mediterranean Sea: Ligurian to Ibiza channel
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #1, 4, 6
	- Major investigation effort was led in the Liguro-Provencal area and the Catalan Margin to study the variability of the Northern current through the combination of independent and complementary observational platforms. The dynamics of the boundary currents were studied to identify the interplay between various forcings (remote, thermohaline and wind), the generation of mesoscale and submesoscale instabilities, and data blending and assimilation techniques were investigated.
	- Major results have shown a clear correlation between hydrographic changes led by climatic interannual variability and the community composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The role of (sub)mesoscale processes have shown to modulate biochemical processes and to locally enhanced marine biomass productions/accumulation.
	- The multiplatform observing system in the NW Mediterranean Sea, combined with growing centralized frameworks of data management and distribution, i.e. Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service and SeaDataNet/SeaDataCloud, will provide the basis for an extended European coastal infrastructure.
 
Mediterranean Sea: Adriatic Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #5 & 6
	- During the project, important steps forward have been made on the development of capabilities to integrate new kinds of experimental data and oceanographic models to support ecosystem management. The implementation of an Adriatic oceanographic model assimilating surface current from coastal radar and temperature profiles from fishing vessels (FOOS fleet) has been developed and tested, providing encouraging results. Surface currents from coastal radars were integrated with results from drifter deployments to investigate zones of recruitment for small pelagic fishes, highlighting the role of remote areas in supporting the ecological role of these environments.
	- One year of high frequency data of sea surface pCO2 was successfully gathered at a fixed station in the northernmost Adriatic. Results highlighted how the biological CO2 uptake during phytoplankton blooms was able to keep the central basin a strong CO2 sink not only in winter, when low temperatures favor CO2 dissolution, but through most of the year, even when temperatures raised above 25°C.
	- The work carried on so far highlighted the potentiality of the area, where historical data and many observational systems are available to support both ecosystem management and advanced marine researches. On the other hand, they pointed out the need for integration of the existing facilities and observational systems also at a trans-border level to address the climate and ecological challenges facing this basin.
 
Mediterranean Sea: Cretan Sea
	- Involved JRAPs: JRAPs #2 & 6
	- An interesting case of how the additional assimilation of glider profiles and FerryBox observations used in the OSE experiment is beneficial for the Aegean Sea forecasting system in terms of reducing the system biases. This improved the sea surface salinity model bias over the south Aegean (north of Crete and south of 37°N).
	- In the Cretan Sea, the vertical migration of mesopelagic organisms (macroplanktonic and micronektonic) was observed by acoustical means for almost 2.5 years in the epipelagic and mesopelagic layers. The observed organisms were categorized into four groups according to their migration patterns which appeared to occur at diel and seasonal scale. The variability of the migration patterns was inspected in relation to the physical and biological environmental conditions of the study area. Stratification of the water column does not act as a barrier for the vertical motion of the strongest migrants that move up to 400 m every day. Instead, changes in light intensity (lunar cycle, daylight duration, cloudiness) and the presence of prey and predators seem to explain the observed daily, monthly and seasonal.
 
This report clearly demonstrates how the consortium of the project is willing to progress on monitoring strategies in several JERICO studies (besides the simulation experiments for transport studies, the analysis of search radius from contaminant sources and the use of covariance in highly relevant low-concentration persistent contaminants, use of multi-functional sensors, etc.); despite the difficulty and time-consuming activity of operating both fixed and mobile platforms working in the highly dynamic complex and densely utilised coastal areas. By progressing on the integration of scientific fields, it also shows the benefit of operating several platforms types (fixed & mobile, at sea, remote, & numerical). For instance, we can emphasize what deployments in JRAPs have proved:
	- JRAP #1: interest in deploying complementary observing systems for algal blooms to get information interoperable at EU level.
	- JRAP #2: success in monitoring highly dynamic benthic ecosystems.
	- JRAP #3: possibility to successfully perform monitoring of contaminants in an interoperable manner.
	- JRAP #4: the highly resolved low-cost sensor and mooring deployments for specific transport or contaminant studies, which shows the intent to be cost-efficient. The complementarity of remote + at sea and numerical systems.
	- JRAP#5: coastal carbon fluxes and biogeochemical cycling: The relatively large variability of conditions keeps being a challenge for sensor developers, with necessary periodic calibration needs that are possible to tackle as shown.
	- JRAP#6: makes a strong case of the need for in-situ data vs models, in particular for coastal processes.
 
A vision: a possible geographical structure of JERICO-RI per region and site
As a consequence, JERICO-RI already proved his capability to gather information and tools to qualify and quantify processes, their scales, related challenges and the possible solution to progress on. As a next step, in agreement with regional stakeholder, JERICO-RI should develop regional forum/center to share information (data and products), expertises, practices, solution and training in line with regional purposes to support scientists and regional stakeholders. This would support application of policies and regulations, based on applied collaborations between scientists and other stakeholders to tackle common societo, environmental and scientific questions from local to regional scales.
According to the monitoring purposes in regions and sites, the need of integration in scientific fields is diverse and JERICO-NEXT presented only a first steps. In the future, JRAPs, TNA & regions should engage with outermost regions where regional projects take place and could be liaised with JERICO RI to better connect these regions in the coastal observing RI landscape. Because of these considerations, the consortium progressed towards regional integrated coastal observatories and preliminary elements are presented in chapter 4.
A main lesson learned is that societal challenges and priorities at the regional level are important elements for the structuring of a coastal observing system. Therefore, a key challenge for the future is to improve regionalisation of the observatories for a better understanding of region-specific processes and an improved fit-for-purpose of the JERICO-RI. Furthermore, the observatories need to be consolidated in terms of performance, reliability and variables to optimally address and answer to key regional and pan-European environmental challenges. The two above-mentioned aspects are the integration challenge that the consortium wishes to tackle by implementing a regional structure of JERICO-RI.
The structuring process will be challenging because coastal observatories are not operated by the same organisations and therefore may have differing objectives and means of operation (financial, logistical, etc.). Based on these differences, we have proposed that the coastal observing systems in JERICO-RI can be structured hierarchically in which all sizes and types of coastal observatories can function in JERICO-RI in an integrated and mutually beneficial way. This will be reported in deliverable D1.4. This way towards a regional structuring of JERICO-RI is included in the proposal for the 3rd project of the JERICO series of projects, JERICO-S3, selected for funding during 4 years and to start in early 2020.

The advent of artificial intelligence, data mining, robotics, etc., has become a standard for successful business endeavors and is known as the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ or ‘Industry 4.0’ in Europe. Data quality improvement through real-time multi-layer data fusion across interconnected networks and statistical quality assessment may improve the usefulness of databases maintained by these industries. Relational databases with a high degree of quality may be the gateway for predictive modeling and enhanced business analytics.	Data quality is a key issue in the sustainable bio-materials industry. Untreated data from multiple databases (e.g., sensor data and destructive test data) are generally not in the right structure to perform advanced analytics. Some inherent problems of data from sensors that are stored in data warehouses at millisecond intervals include missing values, duplicate records, sensor failure data (data out of feasible range), outliers, etc. These inherent problems of the untreated data represent information loss and mute predictive analytics. The goal of this data science focused research was to create a continuous real-time software algorithm for data cleaning that automatically aligns, fuses, and assesses data quality for missing fields and potential outliers. The program automatically reduces the variable size, imputes missing values, and predicts the destructive test data for every record in a database. Improved data quality was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and the normalized root mean square error of prediction (NRMSEP) statistic. 	The impact of outliers and missing data were tested on a simulated dataset with 201 variations of outlier percentages ranging from 0-90% and missing data percentages ranging from 0-90%.  The software program was also validated on a real dataset from the wood composites industry. One result of the research was that the number of sensors needed for accurate predictions are highly dependent on the correlation between independent variables and dependent variables. Overall, the data cleaning software program significantly decreased the NRMSEP ranging from 64% to 12% of quality control variables for key destructive test values (e.g., internal bond, water absorption and modulus of rupture)",science,981,not included

The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. 

The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. 

SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets.

As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data {of an heating distribution network and power consumption data} collected in a major Italian city.

The articles are technicist and productivist, with little regard for environmental and socioeconomic factors, nor the public policies for the development and promotion of fishery and fishery activities, which in a way explains the dissatisfaction with the activity by the fish farmers of the Bom Peixe Association , as well as the inefficiency of the public policy of transforming the artisanal fisherman into an entrepreneur. The Social Network Analysis (ARS) makes clear that there is interconnection among all actors, but the protagonism of this network is dominated by public institutions and the process of communication between the various institutional actors is two-way, while between fish farmers and fishermen is of a unidirectional character, making them only subjects of actions. The Trophic State Index (EIT) was used as a monitoring tool for aquaculture activities in PAS. Limnological variables, with the exception of total phosphorus, despite small variations of oxygen and total solids, are in accordance with the recommendations of CONAMA Resolution 357/05. The data allow us to conclude that the aquaculture area presented a predominance of supereutrophic trophic state and that the trophic state of the reservoir in the vicinity of the tanks is strongly influenced by anthropic activities, mainly in the rainy season. In the dry season, there is an increase in the phosphorus concentration in the water, leading to a hypereutrophic state. It is not possible to say that aquaculture is an impactful activity and its effects are difficult to predict in the long term, as well as the behavior of the reservoir through increased production in the parks, however, if there is no monitoring and efficient control over water quality , fish farming may promote degradation of the aquatic ecosystem. The analysis of the technical, economic and financial feasibility of investment in aquaculture projects of tambaqui production in network tanks used the economic indicators Effective Operational Cost (COE), Total Operating Cost (COT), Total Gross Income (RBT), Gross Margin (MB), Net Margin (ML), Profit (L) and Return Rate of Capital (TRC). The analysis of TRC presented negative results and the system of production in excavated nurseries proved to be more efficient. The system of production in network tanks is an alternative of lower cost and time of implantation, but with uncertain return. The socioeconomic profile of the producers is considered to be incompatible with the business and technological activity of aquaculture in network tanks. In the producers' view, the activity is still a future promise and the public policy of turning fishermen into fish farmers proved ineffective. According to TRC, the activity is unsustainable and has been showing negative results, which indicates its low competitiveness. Sustainability and governance indicators were developed for the development of fish farming in the PAS, which, through social, economic and environmental subindices, generated a Sustainability Index (ISUS) of the enterprise.

This potential can be realized to its maximum only when data science becomes democratized, instead of centralized in a small group of expert data scientists. However, with data becoming more massive and heterogeneous, standing in stark contrast to the spreading demand of data science is the growing gap between human users and data: Every type of data requires extensive specialized training, either to learn a specific query language or a data analytics software. Towards the democratization of data science, in this dissertation we systematically investigate a promising research direction, natural language interface, to bridge the gap between users and data, and make it easier for users who are less technically proficient to access the data analytics power needed for on-demand problem solving and decision making.One of the largest obstacles for general users to access data is the proficiency requirement on formal languages (e.g., SQL) that machines use. Automatically parsing natural language commands from users into formal languages, natural language interfaces can thus play a critical role in democratizing data science. However, a pressing question that is largely left unanswered so far is, how to bootstrap a natural language interface for a new domain? The high cost of data collection and the data-hungry nature of the mainstream neural network models are significantly limiting the wide application of natural language interfaces. The main technical contribution of this dissertation is a systematic framework for bootstrapping natural language interfaces for new domains. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three complimentary methods: (1) Collecting data at a low cost via crowdsourcing, (2) leveraging existing NLI data from other domains via transfer learning, and (3) letting a bootstrapped model to interact with real users so that it can refine itself over time. Combining the three methods forms a closed data loop for bootstrapping and refining natural language interfaces for any domain.The developed methodologies and frameworks in this dissertation hence pave the path for building data science platforms that everyone can use to process, query, and analyze their data without extensive specialized training. With such AI-powered platforms, users can stay focused on high-level thinking and decision making, instead of overwhelmed by low-level implementation and programming details --- ``\emph{Let machines understand human thinking.

By planning for tasks in the same order that they are later executed, total-order HTN planners always know the complete state of the world at each planning step. This enables writing more expressive planning domains than what is possible in partial-order HTN planning, such as preconditions with calls to external procedures.Such features have facilitated the use of total-order HTN planners in agent systems and seen them excel in AI games.This paper describes the Hierarchical Agent-based Task Planner (HATP), a total-order HTN planner. Since its first implementation, HATP has had various extensions and integrations over the years, such as support for splitting a solution into multiple streams and assigning them to the agents in the domain; modelling their beliefs as distinct world states; allowing “social rules” to be included by the user to define what kind of agent behaviour is appropriate; allowing tasks to be planned by taking the human’s safety and comfort into account; and to interleave HTN and geometric planning.Since many of these implementations have remained prototypes, we have significantly enhanced them as well as HATP itself, and integrated them into a stand-alone HATP distribution, which is now available as open source software (under a BSD 2-Clause License).This paper presents some of our recent improvements to HATP, and gives an overview of its user-friendly language, which treats agents as distinct entities; its mechanisms for effective control over decomposition; and its integration into our robotics framewor",science,987,not included

We explore the performance of a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to find clusters in the data together with a supervised learning method such as an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically distinguish between real OCs and statistical clusters.Results. The development and implementation of this method in a five-dimensional space (l, b, ϖ, μα*, μδ) with the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, and a posterior validation using Gaia DR2 data, lead to the proposal of a set of new nearby OCs. Conclusions. We have developed a method to find OCs in astrometric data, designed to be applied to the full Gaia DR2 archive",science,991,not included

They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as ~1% for simulated and ~2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely tho nds of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as a user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort. By facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope",science,992,not included

Computerized Medical Record in the diagnostic-care of the Rare Diseases: development and implementation of a system for the collection and analysis of clinical phenotypic and genotypic data,29/01/2016 00:00,core,https://core.ac.uk/download/78395279.pdf,,"Internationally there is no single definition of a rare disease: in European countries and beyond is determined on the basis of different thresholds of prevalence, in accordance with regulatory requirements: in the European Union (EU), a disease is rare if it has a population prevalence of less than or equal to 1/2000 inhabitants (0.05 %). Rare diseases, from a clinical and epidemiological point of view-, are a very heterogeneous group, with about 5000-8000 entities, mostly with genetic origin, often severe, chronically debilitating, progressive and potentially fatal, representing a major public health problem; nevertheless, in the past, have received little scientific interest, are hardly included in international classifications and barely visible at the level of health information, for many of them also epidemiologic data are not yet available. The main reason seems to be the absence of a system of correct coding and traceability in health information systems: the existing classification systems for collecting phenotypic and genotypic data, are widely heterogeneous, lacking a standard terminology, slightly inter-operable, solely dedicated to the classification of the phenotype or supplied with database features of variants and related phenotypes profiles. Some of these databases are already operating, other developing, along with the implementation of NGS technologies, which guaranteed the medical scientific community, compared to traditional techniques, the study of a wide range of genetic diseases, with the collapse of cost and time of data analysis. Worldwide were established centers and research projects in highly specialized techniques of genome sequencing and development of databases of genomic variants, that have made available a large variety and quantity of new information, often difficult to manage and interpret. The commitment of the scientific community is therefore the systematic organization of that huge amount of data, potentially useful to the correct interpretation of the pathogenic significance of genomic variants in relation to the clinical phenotype. Based on emerging data from the literature, the records of patients and pathologies constitute interesting tools for the development of knowledge useful for the clinical and epidemiological aspect and in the field of rare diseases. Many existing registers must address issues of quality, accessibility and standardization of data, optimization of resources, and interoperability, related to fragmentation of coding systems of diseases. The situation on European and international scene seems to favor the establishment of global registers or common platforms for coordination of all existing and future registers, following a uniform approach, coordinated and of the highest quality. The implementation of this model is currently a strategic objective of the European community within the project EPIRARE and of the US community in the project on Global Rare Diseases Registry (GRDR). In the evolutionary path that supports the implementation of the public health service to improve the exercise of the right to healthcare of citizens, the current development of innovative information technologies, which make available comprehensive information, shared and able to guarantee citizens the best continuity of care, is critical. In Italy, the Electronic Health Record (FSE) is the computerized collection of data of the clinical history of an individual, designed as part of the National Health Service (SSN) according to the National Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health in November 2010. The process is slow, but with the introduction of the SFE is to be hoped that in the near future, we witness a revolutionary change in the relationship between health infrastructure and citizen, so far characterized by communication barriers, rigid and cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and paperwork with improvement of the flow of data and the diagnostic process and healthcare. Also in the international context is documented the usefulness of the so-called ""Electronic Health Record"" (EHR) or ""Personal Health Record"" (PHR) to assist this process in healthcare, as well as for measuring and monitoring the quality of care and for translational research, but the construction and development of the FSE are still at a preliminary stage and the challenges of making the application infrastructure are numerous, especially for developing countries.

Another major challenge on many fronts to health systems in the field of rare diseases is that represented by the heterogeneous group of patients without diagnosis, individuals with known diseases incorrectly recognized, experiencing delays and diagnostic errors, or individuals with unknown diseases; these patients over-use inadequate diagnostic pathways and their care needs are not satisfied, with high human and social costs.

To date the problem of patients without diagnosis was universally recognized worldwide as central, to the planning of health care networks for patients with a rare disease, but its still unresolved: the attempts made in the USA with Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) of National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical Center have shown promising results, but appeared poorly sustainable in clinical practice and still have limited epidemiological value.

Nationally some Accredited Centres for excellence in the diagnosis and treatment of specific rare diseases or groups of related rare diseases, have established projects targeted on finding solutions to methodological collection of clinical phenotype-genotype correspondence, supporting the diagnostic process of patients with rare diseases, with special attention to patients without a diagnosis or with a generic presumptive diagnosis: Region-University research Project ""Next Generation Sequencing and Gene Therapy to diagnose and Cure rare Diseases in Emilia Romagna (rarer)"" and Ministerial Project ""A multicenter collaborative research network for the identification and study of rare undiagnosed patients: the impact on the rare disease National Health Service network (UnRareNet)"".

In the broader context of these research projects present PhD project designed to create a unique collection of analytical data, describing phenotype and genotype features of patients with known or suspected diagnosis, between groups of selected rare diseases, based on a computerized platform, with implementation of the model of the Regional Registry for Rare Diseases, already used in the Veneto Region.

A further objective was the creation of a specific product useful for clinical management in the field of rare diseases, especially with respect to efficiency, speed and accuracy of diagnostic assessment, through the transfer of the instrument for collection of clinical phenotype-genotype data in patients with diseases or groups of selected rare diseases in the form of generalized Computerized Medical Record (CCI).

The form CCI should have features which cut across rare diseases registry and the hospital medical records, dedicated to a single episode of care, and should structur on the emerging pattern of computerized personal health record, such as in Italy, the ""Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico"".

The added value is the integration of the relational database research potential with the clinical applications of CCI in the practical management and care of patients with rare diseases. It was also planned the networking of CCI as part of a shared use of clinical, genetic and healthcare data in real contexts of clinical excellence, such as those offered by the RARER and UnRareNet projects.

The project is structured in three different phases:

1. identification and sharing, within the common RARER protocol, of a suitable methodology for the construction of 8 different disease registries, with implementation of the clinical database and structuring a form of collection of genotypic data; 

2. realization and network sharing of module CCI such as a sustainable product in a clinical setting, containing clinical information in a relational database; 

3. implementation of the acquisition data system and module CCI, with the expansion of the patient population in the context of the project UnRareNet, data analysis, identifying the correlation between genotype and phenotype pictures, and design of an expert system able to manage complex procedures for data processing. 

The research project proposed the implementation of a relational database with the collection through CCI of clinical data in patients with rare diseases with known or suspected diagnosis, in the context of some rare diseases of specific interest.

The clinical entities and major and minor entities, describing phenotype and genotype features are classified in the database according to a classificatory nodular and multihierarchical like a tree method, which integrates uni and multidimensional internationally recognized classification systems and, at the same timem respects the anatomical structure and function of the human organism.

The database includes 72,360 records, distributed between the main and secondary entities (signs, symptoms, comorbidity, impairments, diagnostic, attributes) and relationships between entities, 117 different clinical entities, 63 different genes and 1,186 total patients. The results obtained during the development and implementation of the system of collection of clinical information, with the implementation of the module CCI in the context of the project RARER, have proved the usability of the product in a preliminary context; the expansion of the clinical application in the context of the project UnRareNet, has produced promising results and the system showed a good performance in terms of similar and dissimilar phenotypes, managing fully clinical information regarding total number of different rare diseases and proving thus be generalized flexible and interoperable. The data are still limited at the time, but having analytical characteristics pre-coded, are immediately usable for future complex processing. The collection of genetic information and integration with clinical information appeared feasible with promising results, although the project UnRareNet this is still absolutely at a preliminary stage; patients without diagnosis is about 10% of the total, but more than half of them do not yet have genetic investigation, which proved to be useful to confirm the diagnosis in 53% of cases with known disease. On the total sample of patients, the use of NGS technologies seems to be limited at this stage, but the results highlight the potential of the modern techniques of genome sequencing in the implementation of the diagnostic process; expanding the population of patients enrolled and the targeted application of these new technologies could allow wider knowledge on the phenotypic and genotypic profile of the considered diseases. Having a broader patient population, the creation of the expert system, of which the foundations were laid in the context of this project, will be possible through the collection of theoretical frequencies of clinical and diagnostic findings of some groups of rare diseases related (metabolic, mitochondrial), arising from the international literature and to be included in the system for processing of clinical scenarios. The expert system will allow the validation of diagnoses simulated by collecting new cases with known diagnosis, and the formulation of new diagnoses of known diseases or identification of new clinical entities, even with use of neural networks or Kohonen networks and Fuzzy methods. The methodology for collecting phenotypic and genotypic information in patients with rare diseases, proposed in this PhD project, proved sufficient to satisfy the requirements of applicability and suggested a number of future applications, which aim the expansion of knowledge on genomic variability of rare diseases and to reduce the number of patients without a diagnosis",science,993,not included

The seismicity in Italy is of course variable in time and space, being also very much dependant on local noise conditions. Specifically, monitoring seismicity in an alluvial basin like the Po one is a challenge, due to consistent site effects induced by soft alluvial deposits and bad coupling with the deep bedrock (Steidl et al., 1996). This problem was tackled by INGV first with the Cavola experiment (Bordoni et al., 2007), where a landslide was seismically characterized using a seismic array and also down-hole logging of P- and S-wave travel times at a borehole drilled within the array; later, with an ad hoc project in 2000-2001, with the first installation of a broad band seismic station nearby Ferrara in a borehole of 135 meters depth. Comparison of recordings with a surface seismic station indicated a noise reduction of 2 decades in power spectral density at frequencies larger than 1.0 Hz (Cocco et al., 2001). The instrumentation in Ferrara has been working for several months but after that the seismic station was discontinued due to lack of maintenance manpower.
The Centro di Ricerche Sismologiche (CRS, Seismological Research Center) of the Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS, Italian National Institute for Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics) in Udine (Italy) after the strong earthquake of magnitude M=6.4 occurred in 1976 in the Italian Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, started to operate the Northeastern Italy (NI) Seismic Network: it currently consists of 15 very sensitive broad band and 21 simpler short period seismic stations, all telemetered to and acquired in real time at the OGS-CRS data center in Udine (Fig. 1).
Real time data exchange agreements in place with other Italian, Slovenian, Austrian and Swiss seismological institutes lead to a total number of about 100 seismic stations acquired in real time, which makes the OGS the reference institute for seismic monitoring of Northeastern Italy. Since 2002 OGS-CRS is using the Antelope software suite on several workstations plus a SUN cluster as the main tool for collecting, analyzing, archiving and exchanging seismic data, initially in the framework of the EU Interreg IIIA project “Trans-national seismological networks in the South-Eastern Alps”. SeisComP is also used as a real time data exchange server tool (Bragato et al., 2011).
Among the various Italian institution with which OGS is cooperating for real time monitoring of local seismicity there is the Regione Veneto (Barnaba et al., 2012). The Southern part of the Veneto Region stands on the Po alluvial basin: earthquake localization and characterization is here again affected in this area by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. OGS ha already experience in running a local seismic network in difficult noise conditions making use of borehole installations (Priolo et al., 2012) in the case of the monitoring of a local storage site for the Italian national electricity company ENEL. Following the ML=5.9 earthquake that struck the Emilia region around Ferrara in Northern Italy on May 20, 2012 at 02:03:53 UTC, a cooperation of INGV, OGS, the Comune di Ferrara and the University of Ferrara lead to the reinstallation of the very broad band borehole seismic station in Ferrara. The aim of the OGS intervention was on one hand to extend its real time seismic monitoring capabilities toward South-East (Fig. 1), including Ferrara and its surroundings, and on the other hand to evaluate the seismic  response at the site.
As concerns the superficial geology of the area where the borehole seismic station  has been installed, the outcropping materials are represented by alluvial deposits of different environments, like channel and proximal levee, inter-fluvial, meander and swamps deposits. As  a consequence, the outcropping deposits are everywhere Holocene in age substantially loose or poorly compacted in the first meters-decameters and granulometrically could vary from clay to coarse sand.
Two preliminary reports prepared by the Italian Department of Civil Defense (Dipartimento Nazionale di Protezione Civile) in collaboration with other institutions describe the data  recorded by the national accelerometric network and complemented by additional data recorded by a number of temporary stations (Dolce et al., 2012a; Dolce et al., 2012b). These reports bear witness of strong ground motion values with an acceleration peak of about 0.9 g in the vertical component recorded during the ML=5.8 earthquake of May 29, 2012 by the Mirandola station, located at about 2 km from the epicentre. The analysis of the seismic noise recorded at some stations shows a quite pronounced peak of the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) in the frequency range of 0.6 – 0.9 Hz common to all stations. Finally, strong evidence of liquefaction phenomena are reported at several sites (e.g.: S. Carlo, S. Agostino and Mirabello), most of which have been attributed to the occurrence of saturated sandy layer(s) at shallow depth deposited along an abandoned reach of the Reno River (Papathanassiou et al., 2012).

By so doing, the decision making capabilities of each of these agents should be improved by making decisions that take into account what the remaining agents intend to do. Against this background, the focus of this thesis is to study and design new coordination algorithms capable of achieving this improved performance.In this line of work, there are two key research challenges that need to be addressed. First, the current state-of-the-art coordination algorithms have only been tested in simulation. This means that their practical performance still needs to be demonstrated in the real world. Second, none of the existing algorithms are capable of solving problems where the agents need to coordinate over complex decisions which typically require to trade off several parameters such as multiple objectives, the parameters of a sufficient statistic and the sample value and the bounds of an estimator. However, such parameters typically characterise the agents’ interactions within many real world domains. For this reason, deriving algorithms capable of addressing such complex interactions is a key challenge to bring research in coordination algorithms one step closer to successful deployment.The aim of this thesis is to address these two challenges. To achieve this, we make two types of contribution. First, we develop a set practical contributions to address the challenge of testing the performance of state-of-the-art coordination algorithms in the real world. More specifically, we perform a case study on the deployment of the max-sum algorithm, a well known coordination algorithm, on a system that is couched in terms of allowing the first responders at the scene of a disaster to request imagery collection tasks of some of the most relevant areas to a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These agents then coordinate to complete the largest number of tasks. In more detail, max-sum is based on the generalised distributive law (GDL), a well known algebraic framework that has been used in disciplines such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistical physics, to derive effective algorithms to solve optimisation problems. Our iv contribution is the deployment of max-sum on real hardware and the evaluation of its performance in a real world setting. More specifically, we deploy max-sum on two UAVs (hexacopters) and test it a number of different settings. These tests show that max-sum does indeed perform well when confronted with the complexity and the unpredictability of the real world.The second category of contributions are theoretical in nature. More specifically, we propose a new framework and a set of solution techniques to address the complex interactions requirement. To achieve this, we move back to theory and tackle a new class of problem involving agents engaged in complex interactions defined by multiple parameters. We name this class partially ordered distributed constraint optimisation problems (PO-DCOPs). Essentially, this generalises the well known distributed constraint optimisation problem (DCOP) framework to settings in which agents make decisions over multiple parameters such as multiple objectives, the parameters of a sufficient statistic and the sample value and the bounds of an estimator. To measure the quality of these decisions, it becomes necessary to strike a balance between these parameters and to achieve this, the outcome of these decisions is represented using partially ordered constraint functions.Given this framework, we present three sub-classes of PO-DCOPs, each focusing on a different type of complex interaction. More specifically, we study (i) multi-objective DCOPs (MO-DCOPs) in which the agents’ decisions are defined over multiple objectives, (ii) risk-aware DCOPs (RA-DCOPs) in which the outcome of the agents’ decisions is not known with certainty and thus, where the agents need to carefully weigh the risk of making decisions that might lead to poor and unexpected outcomes and, (iii) multiarm bandit DCOPs (MAB-DCOPs) where the agents need to learn the outcome of their decisions online. To solve these problems, we again exploit the GDL framework. In particular, we employ the flexibility of the GDL to obtain either optimal or bounded approximate algorithms to solve PO-DCOPs. The key insight is to use the algebraic properties of the GDL to instantiate well known DCOP algorithms such as DPOP, Action GDL or bounded max-sum to solve PO-DCOPs. Given the properties of these algorithms, we derive a new set of solution techniques. To demonstrate their effectiveness, we study the properties of these algorithms empirically on various instances of MO-DCOPs, RA-DCOPs and MAB-DCOPs. Our experiments emphasize two key traits of the algorithms. First, bounded approximate algorithms perform well in terms of our requirements. Second, optimal algorithms incur an increase in both the computation and communication load necessary to solve PO-DCOPs because they are trying to optimally solve a problem which is potentially more complex than canonical DCOPs",science,999,not included

This training process involves, among other things, scaling the input and output datasets provided to the neural network. The reason that the scaling process is required, is that real world problem datasets might not be in the range [0, 1], whereas the neural networks work with data only in the range [0, 1], i.e. the neurons fire or they do not. To achieve this, linear scaling is typically used, which for certain datasets can make it difficult for the neural network to properly differentiate between values that are close together. \ud
	This project will show how the implementation of non-linear median scaling can be applied to the training datasets and compares its performance against the linear scaling methodology for a variety of training datasets both for speed of learning and subsequent ability to generalize.  This project demonstrates that after introduction of non-linear scaling into the backpropagation and applying it to the various datasets, there is an improvement in performance to some extent.Computer Scienc",science,1000,not included

By using Multi Agent Simulation (MAS) techniques, among others, social scientists are able to explore “what if ” scenarios of emergent behaviors in complex social systems. However, the Social Simulation method faces many challenges: a) human subjectivity; there is no computer, mathematical model nor software powerful and exhaustive enough to replicate subjective aspects like love, free will, etc; b) pervasive contingency; even if we can simulate the interaction of a great number of variables and environmental factors, a computational simulation will never attain the level of complexity that actual human social phenomena has and c) validation; is it not always easy to extract from the real world the kind of research results needed to validate social simulation models. In the other hand, Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) share many characteristics with MAS models. MMORPGs resemble in many ways the social complexities of the real world, they are also coded through a programming language and they are also based on a hardware/software platform … but they feature one thing that MAS models don’t: real human beings participate on them, instead of mere AI based agents. Therefore MMORPGs are quasi-simulations that offer unprecedented opportunities for studying complex social phenomena. Since it is humans and not only AI NPCs who play them, the “human subjectivity ” problem can be bypassed. Their “sandbox ” nature minimizes the “pervasive contingency ” problem. Moreover, the wide arrange of data gathering possibilities they offer (see for example Ducheneaut et al, 2004, Williams et al 2008a) empower researchers to obtain appropriate results for computer model validation purposes. In this sense, Gee (2004) and Burke (2005) call for the need of bridging complex systems simulation techniques with MMORPGs studies, and in this paper I intend to further the discussion of the kind framework that is needed for such enterprise. The importance of this theme for the Game Studies discipline is put into perspective by a relatively recent bu",science,1001,not included

technology to produce those facial expressions, and research that investigates
the relationship between those technologies and human social perception of
those artificial faces. Our starting point is assessing human perception of core
facial information: Moving dots representing the facial landmarks, i.e., the
locations and movements of the crucial parts of a face. Earlier research
suggested that participants can relatively accurately identity facial expressions
when all they can see of a real human full face are moving white painted dots
representing the facial landmarks (although less accurate than recognizing full
faces). In the current study we investigated the accuracy of recognition of
emotions expressed by comparable facial landmarks (compared to accuracy of
recognition of emotions expressed by full faces), but now used face-tracking

suggested that participants could accurately identify emotions expressed by the
facial landmarks (though less accurately than those expressed by full faces).
Thereby, these results provide a starting point for further research on the

Multinomial Inverse Regression (MIR) has wide applicability to a diverse array of problems. Further, the model is technologically impressive and the software is easy to apply to real problems. I hope that MIR will gain widespread use in the machine learning literature and across the social sciences. This comment will focus on a basic question that arises when applying MIR: how do we know that it is performing well? The daunting challenge is that when using MIR to discover characteristics of words, the usual evaluation methods are inappropriate. The standard eval-uation for methods like MIR is to assess its performance in out of sample prediction tasks. When this is the goal—as in supervised learning tasks—then this is the ideal evaluation. And as the author shows, MIR excels at this task, with superior classification accuracy for the set of restaurant reviews. Text classification is certainly important, but perhaps the most promising application of MIR is to measuring how words convey sentiment. For example, the author uses MIR to identify differences in language between Democrats and Republicans (and differences in lan-guage based on constituency characteristics).

As human survival chances are negatively correlated with detection time, the response time is a vital factor in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, thus potential delays may have dramatic and even lethal results. Moreover, the safety of rescue workers is another major issue and must be ensured in any circumstance. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology can provide a critical and multifaceted support in SAR missions. Given the fact that the faster these operations are planned and executed, the greater the chances of success they get, these aerial robots are ideal candidates for such applications owed to their ability of being nimble, quick-moving and easily programmed to exhibit autonomous behaviors. Hence, with the aim to increase the prospects of distressed people to remain alive, robotic rescue systems—either remote controlled or autonomous ones—must be instantaneously available, to provide a robust helping hand to rescuers, thus boosting their performance and ensuring their own safety. The doctoral dissertation in hand deals with the study and implementation of a novel fully autonomous UAV-based rescue platform for life-saving services, by combining Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) methods and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Specifically, the proposed Autonomous Aerial Rescue System (AARS), namely the ROLFER (RObotic Lifeguard For Emergency Rescue), is capable of precisely locating and providing instantaneous emergency services to humans in peril during critical events. The main system’s components are: a completely autonomous rescue UAV and its bearing equipment, the Ground Control Station (GCS) including all the apparent software and hardware for the system’s proper functionality, as well as the wearable equipment carried by humans in peril for the distress signal transmission. The rescue system’s Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are to: (i) be fully autonomous, i.e. guided solely by data provided by the distressed human’s wearable equipment without requiring to include human-in-the-loop, (ii) provide fast reaction as possible, i.e. to minimize the intervention time a UAV needs to provide invaluable assistance to a human in the context of an emergency and (iii) precisely detect the human in peril as well to accurately release the rescue equipment. The importance of not wasting the critical response time, as well as taking into serious consideration any other vital parameter during a SAR operation is obvious. The main objectives of this research are summarized as follows: The study, design and implementation of a fully autonomous aerial robotic system for the provision of life-saving services to humans in peril, The deployment of two human rescue scenarios in both maritime and terrestrial environments, The detection of human in peril using several accurate advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based localization methods, The detection, tracking and localization of human in peril using advanced image processing techniques as well as the precise rescue apparatus release, The hazard identification and risk analysis of the proposed AARS for the elimination of potential threats to both human in peril and rescue workers, by applying System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Thus, the structure of the dissertation in hand is mainly based on the aforementioned objectives. In particular, Chapter 1 introduces the utilization of robotic systems in SAR operations including some crucial information about UAVs, a review of the related literature, as well the contribution of this dissertation within the state of art. Chapter 2 presents the proposed aerial rescue support system’s architecture and functionality, concerning details about both software and hardware configuration, as well as the system’s performance evaluation in terms of both accuracy and intervention time. Moreover, Chapter 3 addresses the issue of precise localization of the distressed human by implementing advanced geolocalization techniques (e.g. Real Time Kinematics (RTK)-GPS). Thus, an enhanced positioning system which grounds on a specially customized wearable device is proposed, allowing the precise positioning of human in peril. Both hardware and software configuration of the designed novel prototype are described. Experimental results from real flight tests of the proposed AARS and the effectiveness of the implemented moving-base RTK-GPS-based wearable apparatus are also discussed in detail. Chapter 4 presents the vision-based punctual and precise detection of humans in peril from the proposed AARS. In particular, human detection is implemented based on two different approaches:a)by utilizing deep learning techniques on-board the autonomous system’s rescue UAV for the human in peril in maritime environmentb)by combining RTK-GPS techniques and advanced image processing algorithms on the proposed rescue system’s GCS for the human in peril in terrestrial environment. Two suitable datasets, including human in peril in both maritime and terrestrial environments have been created for the computer vision algorithms training. Hardware and software configuration, as well experimental results for the accurate human detection and rescue apparatus fall down are presented in detail.  In Chapter 5, a hazard identification and risk analysis of the proposed AARS, for the elimination of potential threats to both human in peril and rescue workers from the proposed system functionality is presented. The objectives of this analysis are a) to introduce the idea of analyzing the system by dividing it in separate operational modes and b) to feature the advantages of applying a systemic STPA-based safety approach on a SAR mission recruiting the use of UAVs. The dissertation is concluded in Chapter 6 where our findings are summarized and future work is mentioned.The doctoral dissertation in hand has been conducted in the Laboratory of Robotics and Automation of the Department of Production and Management of DUTh, which expertizes in such systems implementations.Το μεγαλύτερο πρόβλημα κατά την διάρκεια καταστάσεων εκτάκτου ανάγκης είναι η άμεση αντίδραση και η παροχή βοηθειών πρώτης ανάγκης στα υπό κίνδυνο άτομα. Λαμβάνοντας υπ’ όψιν ότι οι πιθανότητες επιβίωσης του υπό κίνδυνο ατόμου μειώνονται δραματικά με την πάροδο του χρόνου ανίχνευσης του, ο χρόνος αντίδρασης αποτελεί καίριας σημασίας παράγοντα κατά τη διάρκεια των επιχειρήσεων έρευνας και διάσωσης καθώς ενδεχόμενες καθυστερήσεις μπορεί να οδηγήσουν σε δραματικά αποτελέσματα.

framework for robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD). The latter refers to methodologies
that develop behavioral policies from example state-to-action mappings. To this
end, we study the reciprocal interaction of perception and action, in order to teach robots
a repertoire of novel action behaviors. Based on that, we design, develop and implement
a robust imitation framework, termed IMFO (IMitation Framework by Observation), that
facilitates imitation learning and relevant applications in human-robot interaction (HRI)
tasks. IMFO can cope with the reproduction of learned (i.e. previously observed) actions,
aswell as novel ones. Mapping of human actions to the respective robotic ones is achieved
via an indeterminate depiction, termed latent space representation. The latter accomplishes
a compact, yet precise abstraction of action trajectories, effectively representing
high dimensional raw actions in a low dimensional space.
Moreover, throughout this thesis, we examine the role of time in LfD by enhancing
the aforementioned framework with the notion of learning both the spatial and temporal
characteristics of human motions. Accordingly, learned actions can be subsequently reproduced
in the context of more complex time-informed HRI scenarios. Unlike previous
LfD methods that cope only with the spatial traits of an action, the formulated scheme
effectively encompasses spatial and temporal aspects. Extensive experimentation with a
variety of real robotic platforms demonstrates the robustness and applicability of the introduced
integrated LfD scheme.
Learned actions are reproduced under the high level control of a time-informed task
planner. During the implementation of the studied scenarios, temporal and physical constraints
may impose speed adaptations in the performed actions. The employed latent
space representation readily supports such variations, giving rise to novel actions in the
temporal domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
enhanced imitation scheme in the implementation of HRI scenarios. Additionally, a set
of well defined evaluation metrics are introduced to assess the validity of the proposed
approach considering the temporal and spatial consistency of the reproduced behaviors.
A noteworthy extension of the above regards force-based object grasping for executing
sensitive manipulation tasks. This is also treated in the current thesis via a novel supervised
learning scheme, termed SLF (Supervised Learning for Force-based manipulation).
SLF is formulated as a three-stage process: (a) supervised trial-execution in simulation
to acquire sufficient training data; (b) training to facilitate grasp learning with suitable
robot-arm pose and lifting force; (c) grasp execution in simulation. Subsequently, following
sim-to-real transfer, operation in real environments is achieved in addition to simulated
ones, generalizing also for objects not included in the trial sessions. The proposed
learning scheme is demonstrated in object lifting tasks where the applied force varies for
different objects with similar contact friction coefficients, and likewise the grasping pose.
Experimental results on the manipulator YuMi show that the robot is able to effectively
reproduce demanding lifting and manipulation tasks after learning is accomplished.
In summary, our thesis has studied LfD and has contributed with a novel approach that
introduced latent space representations to encode the action characteristics. A framework
implementation (IMFO) of our approach allowed extensive experimentation and also conduction
of HRI scenarios. The inclusion of temporal aspects in our approach enhanced it
to cope with complex, real-life interactions. Finally, the extension of IMFO with forcebased
grasping facilitated manipulation tasks with sensitive objects",robotics,1011,not included

An adequate selection of the team members and an effective coordination are some of the challenges to fully exploit the unique capabilities that these types of systems can offer. Motivated by real world applications, we focus on a multi-robotic network consisting off aerial and ground agents which has the potential to provide critical support to humans in complex settings. For instance, aerial robotic relays are capable of transporting small ground mobile sensors to expand the communication range and the situational awareness of first responders in hazardous environments.

In the first part of this dissertation, we extend work on manipulation of cable-suspended loads using aerial robots by solving the problem of lifting the cable-suspended load from the ground before proceeding to transport it. Since the suspended load-quadrotor system experiences switching conditions during this critical maneuver, we define a hybrid system and show that it is differentially-flat. This property facilitates the design of a nonlinear controller which tracks a waypoint-based trajectory associated with the discrete states of the hybrid system. In addition, we address the case of unknown payload mass by combining a least-squares estimation method with the designed controller.

Second, we focus on the coordination of a heterogeneous team formed by a group of ground mobile sensors and a flying communication router which is deployed to sense areas of interest in a cluttered environment. Using potential field methods, we propose a controller for the coordinated mobility of the team to guarantee inter-robot and obstacle collision avoidance as well as connectivity maintenance among the ground agents while the main goal of sensing is carried out. For the case of the aerial communications relays, we combine antenna diversity with reinforcement learning to dynamically re-locate these relays so that the received signal strength is maintained above a desired threshold.

Motivated by the recent interest of combining radio frequency and optical wireless communications, we envision the implementation of an optical link between micro-scale aerial and ground robots. This type of link requires maintaining a sufficient relative transmitter-receiver position for reliable communications. In the third part of this thesis, we tackle this problem. Based on the link model, we define a connectivity cone where a minimum transmission rate is guaranteed. For example, the aerial robot has to track the ground vehicle to stay inside this cone. The control must be robust to noisy measurements. Thus, we use particle filters to obtain a better estimation of the receiver position and we design a control algorithm for the flying robot to enhance the transmission rate. Also, we consider the problem of pairing a ground sensor with an aerial vehicle, both equipped with a hybrid radio-frequency/optical wireless communication system. A challenge is positioning the flying robot within optical range when the sensor location is unknown. Thus, we take advantage of the hybrid communication scheme by developing a control strategy that uses the radio signal to guide the aerial platform to the ground sensor. Once the optical-based signal strength has achieved a certain threshold, the robot hovers within optical range.

Finally, we investigate the problem of building an alliance of agents with different skills in order to satisfy the requirements imposed by a given task. We find this alliance, known also as a coalition, by using a bipartite graph in which edges represent the relation between agent capabilities and required resources for task execution. Using this graph, we build a coalition whose total capability resources can satisfy the task resource requirements. Also, we study the heterogeneity of the formed coalition to analyze how it is affected for instance by the amount of capability resources present in the agents.Electrical EngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

Adaptability, proactiveness, and interop-erability are essential characteristics of these games. Many of these competitions focus on development of rational behavior that would allow dominance over competitors.

Additionally, the web has mediated an ever broad-er range of transactions, urging participants to concurrently trade across multiple markets. All these have generated the need for technologies that empower prompt investigation of large vol-umes of data and rapid evaluation of numerous alternative strategies in the face of constantly changing market conditions (Bichler, Gupta, and Ketter 2010). AI and machine-learning tech-niques, including neural networks and genetic algorithms, are continuously gaining ground in the support of such trading sce-narios. User modeling, price forecasting, market equilibrium pre-diction, and strategy optimization are typical cases where AI typ-ically provides reliable solutions. Yet, the adoption and deployment of AI practices in real trading environments remains limited, since the proprietary nature of markets precludes open benchmarking, which is critical for further scientific progress.

Although at undergraduate levels the students are introduced to basic theoretical concepts and tools, at postgraduate courses more complex topics have to be covered. One of those advanced subjects is Cognitive Robotics, which covers aspects like automatic symbolic reasoning, decision-making, task planning or machine learning. In particular, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning and
decision-making methodology that does not require a model of the environment where the robot operates, overcoming this limitation by making observations. In order to get the greatest educational benefit, RL theory should be complemented with some hands-on RL task that uses a real robot, so students get a complete vision of the learning problem, as well as of the issues that arise when dealing with a physical robotic platform. There are several RL techniques that can be studied in such a subject; we have chosen Q-learning, since is a simple, effective and well-known RL algorithm.

In this paper we present a minimalist implementation of the Q-learning method for a Lego Mindstorms NXT mobile robot, focused on simplicity and applicability, and flexible enough to be adapted to several tasks. Starting from a simple wandering problem, we first design an off-line model of the learning process in which the Q-learning parameters are studied. After that, we implement the algorithm on the robot, gradually enlarging the number of states-actions of the problem.

The usefulness of a software simulation is determined by the validity of the underlying model of the system. Software simulation often treats the real world in a less random and more predictable fashion than is the case in nature. The use of an actual physical controlled object creates a more realistic environment to carry out real-time or AI experiments. These physical objects exhibit a more chaotic behavior due to the mechanical issues independent of the controlling algorithm. The construction and use of robots to accomplish this behavior has been successfully done in the past. The research discussed in this paper established a semi-adversarial environment. In this type of an environment one of the parties neither hinders nor assists in the process undertaken. To demonstrate this behavior the most appropriate group of animals is a herd of sheep.

In this paper we describe a framework for autonomous design of experiments for a robotic agent, which enables the robot to improve and increase its conceptual knowledge about the environment through open-ended learning by experimentation. We specify our implementation of this framework and describe how its modules can recognize situations in which learning is useful or necessary, gather target-oriented data and provide it to machine learning algorithms, thus reducing the search space

In most cases of embodied and situated agents, the learning goal for the artificial agent is to „map“ or classify the environment and the objects therein [1, 2], in order to improve navigation or the execution of some other domain-specific task. Dynamic environments and changing tasks still pose a major challenge for robotic learning in real-world domains. In order to intelligently adapt its task strategies, the agent needs cognitive abilities to more deeply understand its environment and the effects of its actions. In order to approach this challenge within an open-ended learning loop, the XPERO project (http://www.xpero.org) explores the paradigm of Learning by Experimentation to increase the robot's conceptual world knowledge autonomously. In this setting, tasks which are selected by an actionselection mechanism are interrupted by a learning loop in those cases where the robot identifies learning as necessary for solving a task or for explaining observations. It is important to note that our approach targets unsupervised learning, since there is no oracle available to the agent, nor does it have access to a reward function providing direct feedback on the quality of its learned model, as e.g. in reinforcement learning approaches. In the following sections we present our framework for integrating autonomous robotic experimentation into such a learning loop. In section 1 we explain the different modules for stimulation and design of experiments and their interaction. In section 2 we describe our implementation of these modules and how we applied them to a real world scenario to gather target-oriented data for learning conceptual knowledge.

Key challenges to the widespread deployment of robots include the ability to learn models of environmental features based on sensory inputs, bootstrap off of the learned models to detect and adapt to environmental changes, and autonomously tailor the sensory processing to the task at hand. This paper summarizes a comprehensive effort towards such bootstrap learning, adaptation, and processing management using visual input.

Two diverse opinions have emerged in the previous discussion. One, due to McCarthy, asserts that emotions will introduce obstacles in the communication among robots and human beings [6]. On the other hand, Minsky sustains the opinion that it is impossible to implement intelligence without emotions [7].

A prototype is available at www.sims.berkeley.edu/research/metadata/demo.html. 1.0 Intelligent Agents Since 1990, intelligent agents have been broadly used in complex, dynamic, and open applications such as production planning, robotics, and in searching the Internet. Though theoretical research as well as real implementation of agent technology are common, there is no commonly agreed-upon definition of intelligent agents. From an Artificial Intelligence point of view, an intelligent agent is a hardware or (more usually) softwarebased computer system that has the following properties: (Wooldridge &amp; Jennings 1995) • Autonomy: agents work on their own without direct interventions of humans or others. • Social ability: agents interact with each other using an agent communication language (ACL, e.g., Telescript, Safe-Tcl, KQML, etc.). • Reactivity: agents perceive their environment and respond in a timely manner. • Pro-activeness: agents are goal-oriented",robotics,1030,not included

So far the field lacks methods bridging the gap between the sophisticated symbolic techniques to represent and reason about action and more and more reliable low-level robot control and navigation systems. In this paper we present GOLEX, an execution and monitoring system for the logic-based action language GOLOG and the complex and distributed RHINO control software which operates on RWI B21 and B14 mobile robots. GOLEX provides the following features: it maps abstract primitive actions into low-level commands of the robot control system, thus allowing the user to concentrate on the application rather than the inner workings of the robot; it monitors the execution of the primitive GOLOG actions, making it possible to detect simple execution failures and timeouts; and it includes means to deal with sensing and user input and to continue the operati..",robotics,1031,not included

The intended application is for autonomous vacuuming robots in completely unknown indoor environments, using a novel topological world model and region filling algorithm. A topological world model based on natural landmarks is built incrementally while the robot systematically cleans the environment.

The implemented learning algorithms presented satisfactory performance on real systems, with a graceful degradation of efficiency due to state ambiguity.

The contribution of the research work reported here is twofold: 1) the development of theoretical frameworks that account for uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics in an environment where an acting agent has to achieve certain goals and 2) the implementation of the developed ideas on a mobile robot. We have elaborated the approach to designing efficient and reliable controllers in Golog following two different perspectives on the environment where the control program is supposed to operate. According to one perspective, investigated in Chapter 4, the agent has a logical model of the world, but there is no probabilistic information about the environment where the agent is planning to act, and the agent is not capable or has no time for acquiring probabilities of different effects of its actions. In this case, the uncertainty and dynamics of the environment can be accounted only by observing the real outcomes of actions executed by the agent, by determining possible discrepancies between the observed outcomes and the effects expected according to the logical model of the world and then by recovering, if necessary, from th",robotics,1035,not included

Several software prototype systems were developed to serve as testbeds for the research and to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach against real problems and current techniques used in NASA\u27s planetary exploration program.  Software prototypes were used to investigate the verification of robot plan execution. New artificial intelligence algorithms for monitoring and diagnosis of robot systems were designed, programmed, and tested. These included plan analysis for monitoring, sensor planning, generation of expected sensor values, and diagnosis of execution failures caused by hardware, environmental or plan anomalies. Testing was performed on a laboratory telerobotic hardware testbed for satellite servicing and on a mobile planetary rover robot operating in natural terrain.  Artificial intelligence algorithms, software prototypes, and more advanced, operationally capable systems for monitoring ground support systems and actual spacecraft in flight were designed, programmed, and tested. A ground support system that served as one test domain was the mirror cooling circuit of the 25-foot Space Simulator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. A prototype monitoring system for this device based on a theory of ""predictive monitoring"" was developed and tested. Mission operations for the Voyager II spacecraft served as another test domain for an intelligent spacecraft health-monitoring and diagnosis system. This system was successfully tested in support of telecommunications operations during Voyager II\u27s encounter with the planet Neptune in 1989. This was the one of the first artificial intelligence systems to be used in planetary spacecraft operations at NASA/JPL. Subsequently, this system was adapted and tested in support of operations of the Magellan spacecraft telecommunications subsystem and the Galileo spacecraft power and pyro subsystem.  Some of the specific artificial intelligence algorithms that were developed for monitoring and diagnosis included the use of heuristic and causal model-based reasoning techniques for predictive generation of sensor values, sensor selection planning, dynamic alarm limit checking, hierarchical procedure specialists for fault diagnosis, and integration of Al with conventional systems in full-scale monitoring and diagnosis applications.  In support of this overall program of research, novel software engineering tools for artificial intelligence research and application development were also developed and will be discussed in the thesis.  The application of artificial intelligence techniques to the monitoring and diagnosis of robotic space systems was shown to be very effective with specific benefits in the areas of systems autonomy, spacecraft safety, ground operations productivity and automation.

Several related works on navigation have used Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) as the primary method of evaluating the path an agent makes to a goal location, but SPL is limited in its ability to properly evaluate agents with complex dynamics. In contrast, SCT explicitly takes the agent's dynamics model into consideration, and aims to accurately capture how well the agent has approximated the fastest navigation behavior afforded by its dynamics. While several embodied navigation works use point-turn dynamics, we focus on unicycle-cart dynamics for our agent, which better exemplifies the dynamics model of popular mobile robotics platforms (e.g., LoCoBot, TurtleBot, Fetch, etc.). We also present RRT*-Unicycle, an algorithm for unicycle dynamics that estimates the fastest collision-free path and completion time from a starting pose to a goal location in an environment containing obstacles. We experiment with deep reinforcement learning and reward shaping to train and compare the navigation performance of agents with different dynamics models. In evaluating these agents, we show that in contrast to SPL, SCT is able to capture the advantages in navigation speed a unicycle model has over a simpler point-turn model of dynamics. Lastly, we show that we can successfully deploy our trained models and algorithms outside of simulation in the real world. We embody our agents in an real robot to navigate an apartment, and show that they can generalize in a zero-shot manner.",robotics,1039,included

Robots have the potential to solve many problems in society, because of their ability to work in dangerous places doing necessary jobs that no one wants or is able to do. One barrier to their widespread deployment is that they are mainly limited to tasks where it is possible to hand-program behaviors for every situation that may be encountered. For robots to meet their potential, they need methods that enable them to learn and adapt to novel situations that they were not programmed for. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making processes and could solve the problems of learning and adaptation on robots. This book identifies four key challenges that must be addressed for an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks. These RL for Robotics Challenges are: 1) it must learn in very few samples; 2) it must learn in domains with continuous state features; 3) it must handle sensor and/or actuator delays; and 4) it should continually select actions in real time. This book focuses on addressing all four of these challenges. In particular, this book is focused on time-constrained domains where the first challenge is critically important. In these domains, the agents lifetime is not long enough for it to explore the domains thoroughly, and it must learn in very few samples.",robotics,1040,not included

The hardware is inexpensive (about \SI{5000}[\$]{}) yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of complex interaction with external objects. The software operates at 1-kilohertz and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. The easy-to-use front-end (in C++ and Python) is suitable for real-time control as well as deep reinforcement learning. In addition, the software framework is largely robot-agnostic and can hence be used independently of the hardware proposed herein. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the proposed platform through a number of experiments, including real-time optimal control, deep reinforcement learning from scratch, throwing, and writing.",robotics,1041,not included
