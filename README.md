# SaLS: Semi-automatic Literature Survey

This project implements SaLS: a semi-automatic program to survey research papers based on the systematic methodology proposed by Kitchenham et al.[1, 2]. 

SaLS automatically retrives papers metadata using the APIs provided by the most popular research papers repositories in the domain of computer science, engineering and information system. Currently, SaLS retrieves papers information from the following repositories:

- [IEEE Xplore](https://developer.ieee.org/)
- [Springer Nature](https://dev.springernature.com/)
- [Science Direct](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/sciencedirect/librarian-resource-center/api)
- [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)
- [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/services/api)
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/help/api/)
